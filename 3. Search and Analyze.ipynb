This came as a bit of a shock to me.  We spend a lot of time in the study of media bloviating over definitions. What is journalism? What is its purpose? In a world of freelancers and bloggers and commentators, who, then, is a journalist? These are difficult questions, not because we don\\u2019t know journalism when we see it, but because it is not exactly easy to come up with a definition broad enough to include everyone whom we feel intuitively belongs, while still managing to exclude those we feel do not.  In an essay I wrote for a media ethics course in February of 2011, I strongly criticized Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel for the following phrase, which is prominent in the introduction to their book on media ethics: \\u201cThe primary purpose of journalism is to provide citizens with the information they need to be free and self-governing\\u201d (2007, 12).  2  This is a nice thought, I wrote, but I don\\u2019t feel it to be very fair to sports reporters -- I don\\u2019t place an inordinate amount of value in what they do, but I\\u2019ll defend to the death their right to call themselves journalists. Same goes for food writers, gossip columnists, and paparazzi. I suppose that means that I fall on the expansive side of the journalism-definition debate.  But here is Adrienne Arsenault, undoubtedly one of Canada\\u2019s media stars, saying that for her the point of journalism is to make people care about wars in countries they\\u2019ll never visit. That certainly doesn\\u2019t include sports writers either, but I really dig it. What gives? Am I just a hypocrite?  Well, maybe. But the point, which shocked me then and seems incredibly obvious now, is that journalism is complicated and can serve a variety of purposes. There might be one big, articulable idea out there that covers all of them, but there doesn\\u2019t need to be, and it might not even matter either way. A corollary to this is that working journalists don\\u2019t necessarily need to know the answers to the big questions to do their jobs ethically, effectively and with purpose. Indeed, when considering topics of research in the field of media, it seems clear that the more specialized the question, the more likely it is to be applicable to real journalistic work.  We\\u2019ll come back to this. But let\\u2019s shift topics for a bit to the question of sources.  Journalists quote sources when producing news. It is a relationship so basic as to defy notice, 3  but like most elements of an enterprise as epistemologically complex as reporting, closer scrutiny yields a wealth of complexity.  I got to thinking about the relationship between journalists and sources in the wake of \\u201cMessage Machine,\\u201d a 2008 article by David Barstow in the New York Times. Barstow wrote about a Pentagon program that briefed retired military officers on the administration\\u2019s policies and plans; those officers would then appear regularly on radio and television news programs as \\u201cmilitary analysts.\\u201d The result was an effective dissemination of the Pentagon\\u2019s media messages into the public conversation on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but through the mouths of ostensibly neutral commentators. Many of the analysts partook because of \\u201cideological and military allegiances,\\u201d and some had ties to defence contractors that stood to profit from a prolonged war effort (Barstow 2008).  The analysts were presented as experts, individuals with specific knowledge relevant to the discussion. Reasonable enough; on the topic of military conflicts, retired military officers are a natural source choice. Certainly in a world of spin, counter-spin and duelling pundits, \\u201cexpertise\\u201d seems like exactly what the media needs more of. Indeed, there is nothing particular in the Barstow piece to indicate that the sources lacked knowledge; they really were experts, but they had also participated in a program, or had financial interests, that called their credibility as neutral sources of information into question.  4  Leaving aside the rather clearer-cut issue of undisclosed financial entanglements, that this Pentagon program caused a scandal shows how both the public and the media itself expect \\u201cexpert\\u201d sources in the news to be held to different standards than those who are explicitly framed as advocates for a political position or faction (Page et al. 1987, 35-36). It is not really in question that a Republican operative, for example, called to comment on the Bush administration\\u2019s policy in Iraq might have had any amount of contact with the Pentagon. It is simply not an issue.  Given the principles of loyalty that members of the military are expected to internalize, I think there is probably some interesting research to be done into whether or not a retired officer could ever be portrayed as purely objective; indeed, it is an open theoretical question as to whether any source can.  This study is not about the peculiar difficulties inherent in military sources, however, so much as the question of how expertise is portrayed and adjudicated in the media. To examine this in detail I would like to turn to quotations from a segment of society much more familiar to both me and, I presume, my readers. For just as quoting from the military presents clear concerns, so too does using academics as sources -- this thesis will attempt to identify some of the specific concerns and practices surrounding scholarly sources. And getting back to the idea that I would like to do research that produces results with immediate applicability to journalistic tasks, it will also attempt to relate those concerns to coverage of a particular area of interest for me: 5  American politics.  Though I feel that pairing it inextricably with the idea of promoting freedom and self- governance is problematic, the basic idea of informing the public put forward by Kovach and Rosenstiel (2007, 12), and countless scholars before and since, is sensible. To speak normatively, though one who informs the public may not necessarily be a journalist, journalists should, in the course of their duties, inform the public (Lippmann 1922, XXIV).  In the area of politics this is particularly relevant, since the basic functions of a democratic system rely on an informed voting public. It seemed to me as I started this project that the role of experts is that of explaining complex concepts related to policy, from a standpoint based more in the scientific method than overt partisanship.  Since digging into the literature surrounding the use of sources I have come to think that I was somewhat mistaken. It is now my belief that the role of expert voices in the popular press is often less to provide informational content than to leverage the source\\u2019s authority. So the quality of neutrality is not subordinate to expertise, it is in fact a requirement for a journalistic source to be treated as an \\u201cexpert\\u201d as opposed to as an advocate or some other type of stakeholder in the news. In other words, that experts are external to the story is not an incidental quality of expert sources, but core to the role they play.  6  Being outside the story is a source of credibility, because it means that experts are assumed to be if not unbiased then at least without specific personal entanglements that might colour their opinions on the topics of discussion; this combined with some presumed amount of relevant knowledge is a potent formula for persuasion, one that can raise or lower a proposed piece of policy considerably in the public\\u2019s regard (Page et al. 1987, 39).  Reporters will sometimes, inevitably, label as \\u201cexperts\\u201d sources who do not fit these criteria, sometimes by accident and sometimes, as in the Barstow military analyst story, when they are either deceived or choose to withhold information that would exclude their source due to unacceptable partisan ties. This is significant because it can lead to information entering the public discourse with more credibility than had the source been portrayed accurately.  This is precisely what the well-trodden journalistic doctrines of honesty and verification are meant to combat, of course. But reading through the history of climate change and public health media coverage, it seems clear that the realities of news reporting procedures have allowed grave, systematic errors to enter the public discourse (Allan 2009; Boykoff 2007a; Hoggan and Littlemore 2009; Oreskes and Conway 2010).  Academic knowledge is by no means exempted from these errors; indeed, most of the deceptive coverage introduced by Hoggan, Oreskes et al. stems from manipulation of academic credentials and public misapprehension about the nature of scientific knowledge (Oreskes and 7  Conway 2010, 267-268). Other errors creep into the discourse by way of an overemphasis by journalists on organizational prestige (Conrad 1999, 290-291).  But unlike other varieties of expertise, the institutional backing of academia has a built-in mechanism for credibility, namely the system of peer-review. Unlike degrees or administrative positions, the completion of peer-reviewed research indicates, with some certainty, that others in the same field, themselves also the authors of peer-reviewed research, see the researcher\\u2019s scholarship as intellectually and academically sound (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269).  This is not to pretend that peer-review is in any way flawless; indeed the process has decidedly mixed reviews from the community it exists to support (Henderson 2010, 738), and has been subject to such critiques for a great many years (Mahoney 1977). For the purposes of this project, though, it is less important that peer review be perfect than that it be the mechanism through which academic credibility is adjudicated within the academic community itself -- at least journalists quoting scholars can then claim to be faithfully portraying academic consensus if they disclose their sources\\u2019 peer-review credentials.  Broadly speaking, then, this project will look into the tactics journalists writing about a major policy issue in the United States, health care reform, used to frame academic sources in the debates in 1993-1994 and 2009-2010. What were the tactics used to introduce and quote academic sources? Were readers of the New York Times during the periods analyzed adequately 8  informed as to who in the academic community was assigned expertise and why? What are the ramifications of the framing techniques currently in use for public policy discourse?  There are, conversely, several important issues this project does not address; it refrains from grappling with the more fundamental question of whether academic expertise is well-suited to explicating the health care debate, or indeed any other issue of complex public policy, in the news. It also does not address the relative merits or different journalistic applications of practical, on-the-ground expertise versus scholastic knowledge \\u2013 there is a large and growing body of work showing that classic academic modes of inquiry can sometimes undermine much older, though less codified, bodies of knowledge, while simultaneously coming to less sound conclusions (Davis, 2005). Just as pressingly, even when its data is good academia has proven itself often unable to effectively communicate its findings because it has difficulty as an institution engaging in discourse with other forms of knowledge (Wynne, 1992).  I should note as well that the framing techniques I will be looking for in this project lie outside those laid out in the manuals of style that constitute the basic standards by which reporters operate. Beyond rules for the abbreviation of degrees and titles, The Associated Press stylebook and briefing on media law notes only that an academic degree might be mentioned to \\u201cestablish someone\\u2019s credentials\\u201d (Goldstein 2002, 5, 207).  The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage contains only guidelines on when to refer to a source with the title of \\u201cDr.\\u201d (Siegal and Connolly 1999, 111) as opposed to \\u201cProfessor\\u201d (1999, 270) or \\u201cProfessor Emeritus\\u201d 9  (1999, 120), and notes that to establish authority, sources will ideally be introduced by their names and titles (1999, 32-33). Though certainly nothing in these guidelines would prohibit more informative framing of sources, I do not wish to imply negligence on the part of the reporters or editors whose articles in my sample met the existing professional standards of their industry; it is rather to those standards\\u2019 inadequacy that I wish to draw attention.  Finally, this project excludes scholastic knowledge from beyond the academy, such as think tank or government research, unless that knowledge is produced in tandem with clearly framed academic institutions or actors. Insofar as these types of research follow much the same rules and by many of the same people as in academia, and are thus subject to all the same problems, this is a somewhat artificial distinction. I have chosen to make it because non-academic scholarship lacks both a consistent relationship to peer-review processes and the assumption of objectivity that I feel is key to how academics are perceived in reporting.   Acknowledging these concerns, though, I have chosen to address herein only the narrower question of, practically, how academic knowledge itself was adjudicated in this date and topic range.  10  Methodology  This study will attempt to examine the techniques by which academic frames are established, with an eye for how adeptly reporters tap into the specific safeguards academia provides for accountability. This lies in the presence of key identifiers that show credibility within the institution of academia, namely the subject\\u2019s peer reviewed research in an appropriate area of study and the currency of their research (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 231; Oreskes and Conway 2010, 272).  This type of analysis has not, to my knowledge, been done in the past. This is not to put on airs, it is simply that I do not believe this narrow technique has been applied to the use of academic sources in policy debates, as it certainly has in examining coverage of science. The question of how to sample is thus less pressing than it might be otherwise; the primary goal of this study is simply to dig in to some data. However, in the interest of procuring a range of results, I have elected to sample from two very similar policy debates in two very different media environments. To be clear, the purpose in this selection is thus not to isolate a sample that is necessarily broadly representative, but instead to generate data on one that is intrinsically interesting: coverage by the United States of America\\u2019s preeminent newspaper of one of the country\\u2019s great policy debates.  The decision to examine both 1993 and 2009 initially hinged on curiosity as to what, if any, broad differences might become apparent in two debates that were in many ways 11  extraordinarily similar (Blendon and Benson 2009, 1) yet which took place in two very different media environments. Most particularly, they fall before and after the advent of internet news. However, as few systemic differences in the data were discovered, this vector of analysis was left largely by the wayside.  I mined articles for data about the academic sources they used, especially upon a source\\u2019s introduction. The following were documented: source\\u2019s names, institutional affiliations and positions, academic disciplines, specific topics of study or explanations of actual research projects performed, if that research was current, if it was peer reviewed (either in a scholarly journal or through presentation at a convention), and its source of funding.  Information about quotations directly from academic research, bypassing the authors entirely, was also collected.  12  Literature review Epistemological categories of journalistic data - why do we need sources?  Drawing on a series of interviews, Peter Conrad writes that most science journalists feel that \\u201cthey themselves can usually articulate the points more clearly in the story\\u201d than the sources they interview (199, 292). So what function do quotations from experts play in a news story at all? The answer lies in the fundamentals of journalistic practice: how journalists manage and convey different types of knowledge.  In Public Opinion, Walter Lippmann notes a distinction between reporting on events that can be accurately recorded and on those that cannot. On subjects like stock prices or the scores of sports matches where there are clear records, he says, \\u201cthe modern news service moves with great precision\\u201d, whereas on matters that cannot be comprehensively recorded its efforts are less reliable and more prone to criticism. As an example he mentions the 1921 Dempsey- Carpentier world championship boxing match, wherein observers initially differed as to which blow knocked-out Carpentier, before moving pictures removed any doubt (1922, XXIII.2).  So Lippmann highlights a difference between topics on which no observer will disagree, because they are apparent and recordable, and those which require some manner of interpretation or recollection and thus are prone to differences of opinion. He notes a variety of reasons why a given event might not be recorded, including censorship, privacy, neglect, or the 13  lack of \\u201can objective system of measurement\\u201d (Lippmann 1922, XXIII.2). In all these situations news is not a simple transmission of observed facts, but instead amounts to the construction of a narrative based on subjective perceptions and available data, and thus subject to a variety of concerns about bias and accuracy. The sum of these concerns, of course, broadly comprises a significant portion of media theory, as journalists and academics attempt to identify the personal and structural biases which are interwoven through all but the simplest reporting.  Likewise there are many issues where records, no matter how complete and perfect, will never fully convey inarguable factivity. An example Lippmann raises is that of a labour dispute; no matter how full a reporter\\u2019s knowledge, even the simple statement that work conditions were \\u201cbad\\u201d can only be made authoritative by a prohibitively large investment of time and resources. And the results of such an investigation would be massive, far too lengthy and complex to have been included in a newspaper column of the day (Lippmann 1922, XXIII.3). Even today, with space concerns lessened by the advent of internet publication, it is still unrealistic to expect readers to wade through thousands of words of exposition to defend simple judgements.  Gaye Tuchman reaffirms that this Lippmann ideology of objectivity is still in effect more than 50 years later in her 1978 book Making News, where she writes that \\u201cfor newsworkers (as for scientists), having witnessed an occurrence is not sufficient to define one\\u2019s observation as factual\\u201d (1978, 82-83). When this is the case a reporter cannot simply register his or her own observations but must rely on third parties, or sources, for input. Tuchman calls the assemblage 14  of quotations to cover a lack of verifiable fact the \\u201cweb of facticity\\u201d, whereby what is true is relocated to the utterance of a source -- that is to say, even when a reporter cannot write authoritatively that a thing is true, she can still definitively state that someone else said that it was (1978, 90).  From a theory of knowledge perspective, then, sources aren\\u2019t merely providers of information; they are necessary for corroboration even when the journalist herself already knows the facts. Within a journalism that pays credence to objectivity, sources are \\u201can essential form of evidence\\u201d (Carlson 2009, 527).  Sometimes, if the reporter considers a source to be prominent enough, a statement might be considered newsworthy no matter whether it is true or not; the utterances of the powerful are often treated as news in and of themselves (Gans 1979, 241). In most other circumstances, though, a reporter, or his or her editors, will probably attempt to determine if something a source has said is true. For example, when a surgeon describes to a journalist the steps of a new procedure, or a witness to a crime relates what he or she saw, the statements produced will usually be of limited scope and thus evaluable, at least in theory, as true or false. In some of these cases, such as that of the witness, normal news practice might require further investigation to confirm what the source has said, particularly if it is controversial or potentially libellous (Tuchman 1978, 84). In other cases, like that of the surgeon, the broad metric of common sense will allow a source\\u2019s claims to be taken at face value. In some cases the 15  assembled facts might even reinforce each other, such as several witness accounts (Tuchman 1978, 86). But in all these instances, the utterance can ultimately be judged either true or false. When the facts are verifiable, it might be argued that the reliability of the source, or how likely their utterances are generally to be true, is of little import beyond the accuracy of the specific statements that they have made.  But not all statements are easily verified, and many are not verifiable at all. There are issues which are abstract (e.g. future trends), technical (e.g. scientific experiments), or both (e.g. scientific theories). Moreover, there are statements that have little or no informational content that can be verified, yet are still of interest to reporters (e.g. \\u201cThis is really important.\\u201d or \\u201cThis is a terrible idea.\\u201d). Many issues and statements like this require not the simple conveyance of already known factual information by a source but instead active evaluation or interpretation -- for example when an economist prescribes policy adjustments based on employment statistics or a sociologist encapsulates the state of the nation\\u2019s school-system as \\u201cgood\\u201d or \\u201cterrible\\u201d (exactly the function which Lippmann writes a reporter may not perform herself; 1922, XXIII.3). In these cases, a source\\u2019s comments might be more or less reliable, depending on their level of expertise and their biases among a bevy of other potential concerns, but they won\\u2019t be simply true or false (Lippmann 1922, XIV.2).  We can thus see a stratum of types of knowledge, from the simplest facts, reportable via first- hand observation, to the most complex topics, navigable only with the help of expert sources. 16  The former answers the question \\u201cwhat happened?\\u201d, which is easily answerable by the press but of limited use to the public (Lippmann 1922, XXIII.3), while the latter might be a response to \\u201cwhat does this mean?\\u201d, which is more valuable but also far more difficult (Lippmann 1922, XXIV). It is primarily the latter sort of knowledge that necessitates the use of expert sources to convey information to the public by way of the news. How expert analysis fits into the news  Though between them Tuchman and Lippmann provide the epistemological tools to define it, both have qualms about the role of expert analysis in news. Lippmann writes that such endeavours are most successful when they operate in tandem with social institutions to disentangle issues, clearly represent concerned interests, and present objective criteria for their evaluation, but he records doubts about reporters\\u2019 ability in their routines to do justice to complex issues. He alleges that a model of the press that attempts to much, \\u201ccharged with translating the whole public life of mankind\\u201d is \\u201cbound to fail\\u201d (Lippmann 1922, XXIV). Tuchman meanwhile writes that she does not believe that news routines can easily overcome their predisposition to privilege legitimated social institutions in marshalling sources, resulting in wide-spread systemic bias that is unhelpful to public discourse (1978, 4-5 91).  Without minimizing these concerns, for the next step towards describing the function of expert analysis in news we can turn back to Conrad. As mentioned above, Conrad writes that most science journalists believe that they are better able in most cases to explicate specific scientific 17  points in their own words than through those of a source (1999, 292). Expert quotes are instead used primarily to contextualize a study by explaining why it is important or even that it is important in the first place, to add legitimacy to the findings of a study by putting personal or institutional weight behind it, to describe the implications of a study, or to provide a balancing perspective (Conrad 1999, 296-298).  It can be readily seen that most of these types of expert quotes will not be factive. Indeed in many cases the actual semantic content of a quote might be minimal; often reporters will quote a source simply saying that a finding is \\u201cthe greatest thing since sliced bread\\u201d (Conrad 1999, 292). Conrad therefore emphasizes choice of source over quote content in assessing a study\\u2019s source use. The framing of sources  Ervine Goffman defined frames in his book Frame Analysis as the elemental blocks of \\u201cunderstanding available in our society for making sense out of events\\u201d (1974, 10). For our purposes in analyzing frames as they crop up in media, however, a slightly more specialized definition put forward by Robert Entman should suffice: \\u201cTo frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text.\\u201d (1993, 52). Frames are thus \\u201ccontextual cues\\u201d by which media consumers understand the broader societal place of an idea in a piece of media, prioritizing some facets of the information they are presented with and deprioritizing others (Iyengar 1991, 11). Framed differently, two news articles carrying 18  identical informational content can provoke vastly different responses in readers, by, for example, placing emphasis on the lives a policy might save rather than lives it will be unable to save (Entman 1993, 54).  The sources journalists choose and the quotes they elect to print from those sources are two ways by which media frames are constructed (Tankard 2001, 100). However, sources themselves are subject to their own frames: it would be nonsensical for a reporter to include a quotation from somebody without telling the reader who that person is and why their utterance is significant. The types of sources journalists choose to incorporate into their stories vary wildly, from otherwise unexceptional citizens who happen to have witnessed something deemed newsworthy, to those highly placed in \\u201cthe hierarchies of nation and society\\u201d, whose very prominence makes their utterances presumptively judged worthy of inclusion (Gans 1979, 241-242). Another category might be the \\u201caffected\\u201d, those whose lives are directly impacted by the issue being covered (Conrad 1999, 301). And, of course, there are experts. The utterances of each of these carry different weights: for example, a succinct, punchy quote like \\u201cthis is the best thing since sliced bread\\u201d clearly carries different weight and implication if it is said by a someone who is described as directly affected by the policy, by an advocate for a specific political cause, by a teenager approached on the street, by the President of the United States, or by a scholar. In some of these cases we might take such an utterance very seriously, and in others disregard it entirely.  19  Like all sources, academic experts are selected broadly to maintain the credibility of journalistic claims of truth (Carlson 2009, 527-528). However, unlike members of the public or public figures, experts are generally assumed to be nonpartisan and in possession of uncommon insight into the topics they comment upon (Page et al. 1987, 39). Not all experts are scholars, of course, but scholars have particular credibility; in some cases, most notably on questions of narrow scientific knowledge, academics may be the only people qualified to speak authoritatively on a subject (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 272).  Scholarly quotes are among the most influential and authoritative a journalist can print (Page et al. 1987, 35-36; Oreskes and Conway 2010, 272), and the institution of academia relies on peer review to enforce accountability on behalf of its members. Unless an academic\\u2019s claims have passed through the process of peer review, they are nothing more than claims; they may be well-argued or convincing, they may even be correct, but they do not have the endorsement of the academic community from which they spring, and it is that community, and through it the broader institution of the academy, that provides the credibility, or proof of expertise, that distinguishes academic from non-academic knowledge (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269). The substantial persuasive weight carried by the academic frame, in other words, is within the institution of academia itself legitimated only via regular submission to the process of peer review.  As Lippmann noted, there is almost never space within media discourse for factual claims to be 20  exhaustively argued (2004, XXIII.3). And Conrad writes that the actual quotes from academics used can be subjective, speculative, or extremely informationally scant (1999, 292-293). But if the quotes themselves are problematic to evaluate, and peer review is the only real measure of an academic\\u2019s credibility within his or her field, then frames which introduce academic voices without showing readers that those voices have successfully navigated the process of peer review on the topic at hand are clearly lacking -- without that clearly demonstrated relationship, readers have no reliable way to judge which sources have earned academic credibility and which have not.  I suspected that this was problematic coming into this project because I suspected that the most common technique used to frame an academic source in a news article is by way of the source\\u2019s organizational position, which is not necessarily particularly meaningful. Certainly this proved to be the case in the specific time and issue spans I analyzed. This mismatch seems a likely culprit for many of the instances documented by Oreskes, Hoggan et al. of academic credibility being granted when it is not merited, i.e. when the subject has an organizational title or an impressive resume but no current research, or none at all ever, in the topic under discussion (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 271; Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 103).  Problems with expertise  Lest we become too gung-ho in endorsing the powers of academic expertise, backed up by peer 21  review or otherwise, we should turn briefly to some of the consequences for misuse of academic sources, and some further cases where the academic system as a whole has failed to produce useful results.  The fundamental constraint on journalists in choosing a source is accessibility; a source must be someone who is willing and able to talk to reporters. More fundamentally, a source must also be someone the reporter knows about and thinks of as an \\u201cexpert\\u201d (Gans 1979, 241). Practically recognizable experts will usually be part of a legitimated social institution (Gans 1979, 246), of which academia is the prime example. Academic experts have the advantage of coming backed by a system of checks and balances: their degrees, organizational stature and most importantly their peer reviewed research all help prove their credibility to the public (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269).  But journalists do not see all organizations as equal, nor all positions within them. Harvard is generally seen as a more prestigious institution than the University of Iowa, for example, and a quote from a scholar at the former may thus be seen as more valuable than one from the latter (Conrad 1999, 291). Likewise a quote from a dean will usually be seen as more valuable than one from a lab researcher. In both these circumstances journalists have a preference for experts with prestigious titles over those without, as this fosters a sense of legitimacy for the story and is believed to be more persuasive (Conrad 1999, 291). But it is often the less prestigious bench scientists performing on the ground research that have the highest levels of technical 22  knowledge, and it is entirely possible that the world expert on any given subject will be at the University of Iowa rather than Harvard. So though sources must have useful input into a topic, in each case the journalists Conrad interviews emphasized that the prestige and persuasiveness of a source often trumps specific expertise (1999, 290-292).  Conrad writes that \\u201cbalance\\u201d in science stories need not follow the same norms as in standard reporting because they are so often based around peer reviewed studies, which are presumptively valid. So though introducing cautionary notes or acknowledging controversy is not only appropriate but may, in some cases, be necessary to \\u201cround out a story\\u201d, \\u201cfringe\\u201d views need not be given equal weight with consensus views to satisfy some artificial ideal of balance (1999, 293).  But fringe views aren\\u2019t necessarily easy to distinguish. The literature is peppered with instances of expertise being misassigned: Stuart Allan documents coverage of an inventor affiliated with a local university who claimed to be able to use a \\u201ccombination of a... DNA sample and GPS satellite technology\\u201d to locate a missing child. Though there was nothing but \\u201chocus-pocus\\u201d science behind the purported invention and the inventor was not in fact an academic of any variety, failure to fact check by one news outlet led to the story behind picked up by many more (Allan 2009, 280-281).  Similarly but more seriously, Diana Davis documents how scientific and media consensus about 23  desertification in southern Morocco differed systematically from what was reported by the indigenous herdspeople who actually lived there (2003, 511-519) \\u2013 here too an echo-chamber effect allowed academic claims to quote and build upon each other even though their conclusions were contradicted by the facts on the ground. This, combined with strong economic incentive for policy-makers to emphasize the severity of the problem, allowed questionable data to persist in both media and academic views of the region (Davis 2003, 520).  Equally troublingly, Maxwell Boykoff showed in a pair of studies in 2007 how coverage of climate change was very responsive to political and economic currents; in the 1990s coverage systematically highlighted \\u201ccontention rather than coherence\\u201d, even though in the scientific consensus in that period was rapidly converging (2007a, 486). Meanwhile, he also showed that in the mid-2000s media coverage and scientific consensus came together only as the political environment in the United States changed around 2005 to become more receptive to scientific claims of anthropogenic climate change (2007b, 10).  Though Boykoff touches on the deliberate misinformation sewn into the debate on climate change by various aspects of the energy industry, he is more concerned with macroscopic effects than specific details. Hoggan and Littlemore lay out, from a Canadian perspective, specifically how economic entities threatened by climate change were able to sustain doubt in the public discourse long after it had been largely dispelled in the scientific community. Businesses with interest in averting meaningful action on climate change accomplished this 24  primarily by injecting expert voices into the media conversation in a variety of ways. Some were scientists who had legitimate credentials in other disciplines like Frederick Seitz, an acclaimed physicist and former president of the National Academy of Sciences who in his later career became a leading global warming sceptic, although his area of expertise was unrelated to climate science (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 41). Others, like Christopher Walter, have little if any formal academic prestige but are able to claim expertise either by outright fraudulence (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 114) or by way of positions within industry funded organizations with deceptive titles -- Walter is a spokesperson for the industry-backed \\u201cScience and Public Policy Institute\\u201d (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 113). Such \\u201cExperts\\u201d are able to persuade because they are able to lay claim to the mantle of academic credibility despite lacking research in any relevant disciplines.  Oreskes and Conway examine those same processes, but on a variety of issues beyond global warming. Similar campaigns of misinformation have been waged, often through the same constructed \\u201cexperts\\u201d, to cast doubt on findings that cigarettes are harmful to health (which Oreskes identifies as the original such campaign), the existence of acid rain, the risks of the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative, and the dangers of pesticide use (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 6). In each case Oreskes and Conway show that successful strategies were less focused on spreading actively false information, which can be refuted, but instead on sowing confusion, relying on the theory that policy-makers, faced with an apparent lack of certainty, would choose not to act (2010, 267). In effect industry-hired academics were employed to issue deceptive, 25  non-factive analysis which resulted in media coverage that obscured matters of relative scientific certainty. The health care reform debate in the United States  There have been a great many attempts to implement legislation that would defray and control the perpetually rising costs of health care for citizens of the United States for at least a century. Health care reform has been a signature issue of, at the very least, Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Clinton and Obama. Of these the only resounding success before Obama was the Kennedy/Johnson administration, which passed Medicare in 1964. In that same century practically every other industrialized or industrializing nation in the world implemented universal health coverage of some sort, but such measures were repeatedly stymied in the United States (Jacobs and Skocpol 2010, 2-5).  It is thus unsurprising that health care reform was the most significant non-economic issue to the American public at the beginning of both recent Democratic administrations, Clinton and Obama in 1993 and 2009 respectively (Blendon and Benson 2009, 1). Effective management of a country\\u2019s health care system is generally considered vital from a policy perspective (Berman 1995, 26), and the United States\\u2019 in particular is widely judged as badly flawed in its failures to achieve universal coverage (Mechanic 2001, 35) and control costs (Inglehart 1992, 742). Coverage of health care reform in the United States differs from coverage of health care itself because though the latter is generally criticized as sensationalistic (Dan 1992, 1027), inconstant 26  (Angell and Kassirer 1994, 189), and incomplete (Moynihan et al., 2000, 1647-1648), coverage of reform tends instead towards the conservative, emphasizing risks rather than rewards (Mechanic 2001, 36).  It is also a debate with very high degrees of interest group involvement, both in the form of well-funded advertising campaigns (West et al. 1996, 63-64) and in funding for research both on the reform proposals themselves and media coverage of the reform, all of which made it into media coverage of the issue (West et al. 1996, 41). As this saturation of viewpoints increased, media coverage of the reform debate, in 1993-1994 at least, became less and less focused on specific policy issues and more on the meta-coverage of the debate itself (Jamieson and Cappella 1998, 110). 27  Findings  News articles from the sample very rarely framed academic sources in terms of their research, let alone with clear reference to their work\\u2019s peer review. Instead academics were overwhelmingly introduced using a combination of their institutional affiliations and positions, fields of study, and occasionally in terms of their specific areas of specialization. These constructions followed certain clear patterns, for which I have devised and named categories in order to discuss them at more length below.  Table 1 \\u2013 Distribution of frame types  Frequency Percentage of all sources All quotes 186 100.00 Author frame 8 4.30 Authority frame1 39 20.97 Discipline frame 40 21.51 Positional frame 96 51.61 Research frame 3 1.61 Specialist frame 22 11.83 Studies quoted directly 17 9.40 1Authority frames were each also counted as another frame-type.  28  Strikingly fewer academic sources total were found in a somewhat larger pool of articles in 2009-2010 than 1993-1994. Within articles that quoted at least one academic source, those from the 1993-1994 period also quoted a slightly greater number of academics on average. Given the relatively small size of the samples I don\\u2019t feel that this difference is large enough to state conclusively that academic sources are quoted less frequently now than they were in the early 1990s, but this is a potential avenue for future research. I did not find any other strong patterns of difference between data from the two time periods.  Table 2 \\u2013Rates of academic quotation in the two sampled time periods Time period Sampled articles on health care reform Articles quoting academics Rate of academic quotation Number of academic quotations Quotes per article 1993-1994 663 70 0.1056 118 1.69 2009-2010 792 48 0.0606 68 1.42  I also found a distinct lack of diversity when it comes to who was quoted. Fully fourteen of the 120 academic sources located in the 1993-1994 sample were Dr. Uwe Reinhardt; on November 14th 1993 alone he was quoted in four different articles by four different authors. Interestingly, Reinhardt was only quoted twice in the 2009-2010 sample despite still being very active academically (indeed, his research in the last two decades has turned to American health care where previously he appears to have mostly studied the German system). Several other academics, namely Sara Rosenbaum, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Robert Blendon and Ross Baker, 29  were quoted four or more times. Academics from prestige universities also occupied a disproportionate share of the sample: 25 of the 186 total quotations were from Harvard alone, for example, and in total 68 of the 186 were from the eight Ivy League universities.  In those articles that included reference to discrete pieces of research, funding was disclosed relatively infrequently: just once in the specialist frame, three times in the author frame and five times in quotations directly from research. However, though not all academic research is externally funded, no article disclosed an absence of external funding; in many of the cases which lacked any mention of funding this can be presumed to be the case. A study of funding disclosures would need to cast its net more widely than I have in order to round up an adequate quantity for analysis.  To look at the ways that academics actually were framed and discuss the ramifications of those choices, I have identified and named the following categories of frames:  The research frame  Of the 186 sources identified, only 11 were framed with clear reference to peer reviewed studies they had done in relevant fields. Eight of those were quoted to discuss their own research in articles specifically about that research -- those I have analyzed separately under the heading \\u201cThe Author Frame\\u201d below.  30  Of the remaining three, two were in the same article, Reed Abelson\\u2019s \\u201cWhen Legislation Goes Into Overtime\\u201d, printed on December 27th 2009, which drew historical parallels to a quickly repealed Reagan-era attempt to prevent the medical bills of the seriously ill from spiralling out of control, the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. Jon Gabel and Thomas Rice were introduced in the article as follows:  ''What is similar is a lack of understanding,'' said Jon Gabel, a health researcher who  helped write a post-mortem of the repealed bill for the journal Health Affairs in 1990.   The support of groups like AARP is also a critical difference, said Thomas Rice, a health  policy expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is also one of the authors  of the 1990 Health Affairs piece.  Uncommonly, Abelson\\u2019s framing of Gabel does not make his institutional affiliation clear; though he is a senior research fellow at the University of Chicago the bulk of his work appears to have been done by way of the non-profit sector, so perhaps this is a deliberate omission. This highlights the power of the author frame, though, and indeed the broader points about peer review upon which this project is based: despite knowing almost nothing else about him, a reader encountering the passage above would have clear justification to give credence to his opinion. On that same note, though Rice\\u2019s framing contains additional information about his academic career, it does not seem like Abelson intends him to have more credibility than Gabel. 31  Regardless, both introductions are succinct; providing sufficient information to back up Gabel and Rice\\u2019s expertise does not disrupt the flow of the 1039-word article.  As an aside, though only four other sources quoted by Abelson were found in the total sample (two of them in this same article) all were somewhat more informatively framed than the norm.  The other academic framed in terms of her peer reviewed research is a somewhat marginal case, as it appears possible that it was incidental, and refers only to research that would undergo peer review in the immediate future, rather than a finished study. In Adam Clymer, Robert Pear and Robin Toner\\u2019s August 29th 1994 article \\u201cWhat Went Wrong? How the Health Care Campaign Collapsed\\u201d, we find this passage:  And newspapers and television failed to cut through the din and educate people, said  Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania.  Instead, they merely elevated public skepticism.  \\\"Everything the press did appeared to engender cynicism,\\\" she said, citing a study that  she and a colleague, Joseph N. Cappella, plan to present next Saturday to an American  Political Science Association convention in New York.  32  Jamieson\\u2019s introduction in the article, then, begins as an absolutely typical example of the authority and professional frames (described in more detail below). While the authors\\u2019 work- process can only be guessed at, it seems possible that Jamieson herself made spontaneous reference to a paper that was going to undergo peer review -- its inclusion thus appears more likely to be an accident than a deliberate effort on behalf of the authors to establish Jamieson\\u2019s academic credibility. Coincidentally, the study mentioned is almost certainly the same one by Jamieson and Cappella that is referenced in this paper\\u2019s literature review, \\u201cThe Role of the Press in the Health Care Reform Debate of 1993-1994\\u201d.  Within a sample of 186 sources, three examples over two articles, and one of them marginal, can only be considered outliers. In sum, academics were effectively never framed with reference to their peer reviewed work in 1993 and 2009 when called to comment in anything save articles actually about their own research.  The discipline and professional frames   The two most common methods of framing academic sources in the sample were also the most informationally scant. As they are very similar in their ramifications, I will deal with them together.  In the first, which I\\u2019ll call the discipline frame, sources were introduced by a combination of 33  their institutional affiliations and disciplines of study. Of the 186 academic sources I examined, 40 were framed this way.  Here is an example, from Gina Kolata\\u2019s August 12th 2009 article \\u201cInsurers' Survey Points to Big Bills as Health Care Problem\\u201d:  The situation is so irrational, said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, that it simply cannot go on. \\u201cWe will not emerge out of this decade with this lunacy,\\u201d Dr. Reinhardt said, adding, \\u201cYou worry about credit card charges, you scream for consumer protection -- why not scream for it here?\\u201d  As is quite typical for this sort of article, the above is the entirety of Reinhardt\\u2019s participation in the article -- here he is agreeing with the basic conclusion of an insurance industry survey that pointed to inordinately high doctor\\u2019s fees as a key contributor to the country\\u2019s health care cost crisis. But especially with such an inflammatory quote, and one which is effectively impossible to fact-check, who he is is very important despite the brevity of his contribution. A \\u201chealth economist from Princeton\\u201d seems, at first blush, someone who should have great deal of credibility on this topic. On closer examination, though, it doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean much; a reader doesn\\u2019t know if Reinhardt is a post-doc, a researcher, a professor, or indeed a hobbyist affiliated with the university in some other capacity (Allan 2009, 281). Nor does the reader have any way to know if he has done any research relevant to the topic, nor, if he has, if it was done 34  in the last 30 years. A \\u201chealth economist\\u201d might be someone who studies outcomes and efficiency, or how demand works in the health care system, or any number of esoteric topics that might have little or no bearing on whether the fees doctors charge in the United States are rational. The discipline frame offers little by which a reader can judge the credibility of a source save a vague sense that they study something in the field, and of the credibility of their academic institution.  Very similarly, the professional frame introduces an academic source by their field of study and specific institutional positions (but excluding positions of authority, which I have chosen to discuss separately below under \\u201cAuthority frames\\u201d). At 96 sources within the 186 collected, this was the most common type of frame used to present academics. The most common position by a considerable margin (50 total) was, unsurprisingly, \\u201cprofessor\\u201d; most of the rest were similarly generic titles like \\u201clecturer\\u201d, \\u201cteacher\\u201d, \\u201cresearcher\\u201d and \\u201cphysician\\u201d.  A scattered few were introduced using more specific titles like \\u201cassociate professor\\u201d, \\u201csenior fellow\\u201d or \\u201cprofessor emeritus\\u201d. Many of these titles carry quite a lot of information for those who understand their ramifications \\u2013 for example, \\u201cassociate professor\\u201d is a tenured position, which usually means that its holder has published a certain amount of peer reviewed research. However, though these carry more value for the reader, their use is limited by their impenetrability to those outside the academy (they are in effect jargon terms) and by the different standards academic institutions use to determine qualifications. A reader conversant 35  with the university faculty career path will find them informative, but there\\u2019s little reason to believe that they will carry much weight with the public at large.  Here is an example of this type of frame from Peter Kerr\\u2019s September 13th 1993 article \\u201cDoctors and Insurers Say Program Would Tread Too Heavily on Their Turfs; Cap on Premiums Is Seen as Stifling Real Competition\\u201d:  \\u201cWhat might happen if you have too tight a cap on insurance company premiums is that their profit margins get wiped out,\\u201d said Uwe D. Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University and a medical economist.  This is materially almost identical to the discipline frame example above, with the single additional piece of information about Reinhardt: that he is a professor at Princeton. This clears up a single question a reader might ask about Reinhardt\\u2019s credentials, he is some variety of professor rather than a less prestigiously positioned academic (however, to refer back to Peter Conrad as quoted in the literature review above, in reality institutional prestige does not necessarily reflect actual expertise; 1999, 291). Professors and other instructors might also be presumed to carry a broader base of knowledge than academics who do not teach, such as administrators or researchers. But the positional frame doesn\\u2019t help at all to prove his specific expertise.  36  As it turns out, Reinhardt, Princeton\\u2019s James Madison Professor of Political Economy, has done a significant amount of research in the areas he is commenting on here. He published an article in Health Affairs in 2006 titled \\u201cThe Pricing of U.S. Hospital Services: Chaos Behind A Veil Of Secrecy\\u201d which, at somewhat greater length, expounds much the same point of view that he expresses in the first example above, backed by substantive research -- notably, in that article Reinhardt explicitly thanks his anonymous peer reviewers for their \\u201cconstructive criticism on an earlier draft\\u201d (2006, 68). And he wrote an article for the American Journal of Law and Medicine\\u2019s first issue in 1993 examining, among other things, various schema for the pricing of health insurance titled \\u201cReforming the Health Care System: The Universal Dilemma Implementing U.S. Health Care Reform\\u201d.  So in both these cases the source quoted appears to be one whom the academy would readily recognize as qualified to discuss the topics he is commenting on, but a conscientious reader might be forgiven for entirely disregarding Reinhardt\\u2019s opinions for lack of information as to who he is. Casual readers, of course, will presumably see \\u201cPrinceton\\u201d and pay attention to what he has to say, but that in this case their confidence would be well-placed does not change that they could have as easily been wrong to do so.  An example of where such a reader\\u2019s faith may have been misplaced can be found in the article \\u201cChristian Leaders Unite on Political Issues\\u201d written by Laura Goldstein and published November 20th 2009. Therein, a Princeton \\u201cprofessor of jurisprudence\\u201d, later reintroduced as a 37  \\u201clegal scholar\\u201d, named Robert P. George is quoted regarding health care reform that \\u201cthe dangers to religious liberties are very real.\\u201d This quotation is set against one from Ira Lupu, a \\u201claw professor at George Washington University\\u201d, who characterizes suggestions that religious institutions might somehow be forced to accept abortion or embryo-destructive research as \\u201cfear-mongering\\u201d.  In this case, Lupu has written several peer reviewed articles in the last decade on the ability of the American government to impose behaviour on religious institutions. But George doesn\\u2019t appear to have any current scholarship, and those articles of his I was able to locate address questions of natural law and Catholic morality; the case for his expertise on the question of how health care reform might impede religious liberty in the United States seems much weaker. Within the limited frame presented in the Goldstein article, however, a reader has no tools to make such a distinction. Indeed within the article the two are explicitly equal in stature as professors of law.  As someone with no personal knowledge of either of these scholars, or indeed any deep knowledge of law scholarship, it is very difficult for me to declare that Lupu is more credible on this topic than Robert. Moreover, it is of course entirely unrealistic to expect that any reader will do even the small amount of background investigation into the two that I have done. But this is precisely the bind that an article\\u2019s author, who has direct access to the sources and an existing obligation to verify their expertise, could have resolved for readers simply by explaining 38  what research these sources have done that leaves them qualified to comment. The authority frame  In the authority frame reporters introduce an academic by way of a position of authority or prestige, most often director of a centre or institute. While in many ways this carries much the same ramifications as an ordinary professional frame, constructions of this type carry a few interesting characteristics that merit separate attention.  There were a total of 38 examples of authority framed academics in the sample, including the above mentioned 29 professional frames, plus three in specialist frames and six in author frames (see below).  As a side note, despite Conrad\\u2019s assertion that all else being equal journalists prefer to quote scientists with prestigious titles over those without (1999, 291), this means that academics who did not hold prestigious titles were quoted approximately five times as frequently as those who did. Moreover, recall that this is in the New York Times, a newspaper whose reporters surely do not have difficulty gaining access to those in positions of authority (especially remembering that usually one of the duties of a director of an academic institution is to be available to the media). I  would not have been surprised to find a far greater proportion of managers and executives in the sample; that there were as few as there are implies to me that the Times reporters were considering more than just a source\\u2019s prestige when choosing whom to quote. 39   For an example of the authority frame, and how choosing an academic with a prestigious title can actual confuse issues of credibility, see this passage from David Herszenhorn\\u2019s October 12th 2009 article \\u201cSoaring Costs Remain a Bugaboo in Expert\\u2019s Eyes\\u201d:  Can all that money really be saved without rationing care or lowering the quality of  treatment?  \\u201cIn three letters: yes,\\u201d said Elliot G. Fisher, director of the Center for Health Policy  Research at Dartmouth College, which produces an atlas showing how Medicare  spending varies widely across the country with no evidence that higher expenditures  achieve better outcomes for patients.  Fisher is then quoted at length through the article. This formulation raises three distinct issues:  First, though Fisher is director of a college centre for health policy research, his area of research and the currency of his expertise is not clear. This is basically similar to problems raised above with the professional and discipline frames, but problems of currency in particular are exacerbated in the case of a source in a managerial or executive role: though in many cases the opposite will certainly be true, these roles conceivably risk pulling even the most diligent scholars away from their own research. In Fisher\\u2019s particular case this may not be the case: he is 40  listed as the co-author of quite a few articles in the last decade on quality of care, for example \\u201cThe Implications of Regional Variations in Medicare Spending\\u201d, a two-part article printed in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2003. None of this is clear from the article, however, and a reader could be forgiven for guessing that someone in Fisher\\u2019s position might not have much time to pursue his or her own research.  Second, Fisher\\u2019s connection to the atlas mentioned, a significant research endeavour even if it isn\\u2019t subject to peer review, is opaque: the reader, knowing nothing about the size or composition of the Dartmouth centre, has no real way of gauging his personal level of involvement in the research which produces it. Even had Fisher\\u2019s precise position within the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, \\u201cco-principal investigator\\u201d, been disclosed it would not be clear what his day-to-day role in its work is, sitting as he does atop a staff of about 20 other scholars plus assorted analysts. Barring a digression into the inner workings of the atlas, this is not an easily solvable problem; unlike \\u201cprofessor\\u201d, which carries a strong implication of both research and instruction, none of Fisher\\u2019s many titles necessarily imply that he is active in the production of knowledge.  Third is the issue that, unlike academics generally, executives in academic organizations are expected to be advocates, and thus advance agendas. Regardless of whether this is true on a case by case basis, this makes them very different from \\u201cordinary\\u201d academics, who are quoted because they are seen as neutral (Page et al. 1987, 39) and are probably no more or less 41  agenda-driven than any other randomly selected individual. In his first quote alone Fisher is making a very bold assertion. The paragraph that follows implies that he has access to research to back it up, but because he is also clearly identified as the director of a health policy research centre I would expect a sceptical reader to take his assertion with a grain of salt -- what is he trying to gain for his centre by saying what he is saying?  This is not to imply that Herszenhorn should have concealed Fisher\\u2019s position from his readers, of course, nor that academics who attain managerial or executive positions shouldn\\u2019t be quoted when appropriate. But these three issues do suggest that such positions can actually be disadvantageous when attempting to establish an academic source\\u2019s expertise and neutrality, contrary to the perception (Conrad 1999, 291) that they are more desirable. This in turn emphasizes that when academics who have attained prestigious positions are quoted, effective and informational frames are even more important than for ordinary academic sources. The specialist frame  In somewhat fewer instances, 21 total in the sample, academics were introduced by way of their specific topics of study. This I have called the specialist frame, since it emphasizes not just the source\\u2019s discipline (though it includes it), but also their area of specialization. For example, see this passage from David Rosenbaum\\u2019s July 24th 1994 article on Newt Gingrich, \\u201cA Republican Who Sees Himself as a Revolutionary on the Verge of Victory\\u201d:  42  This could hurt Mr. Gingrich's effort to win control of the House for Republicans, said  James Thurber, a political scientist at American University who studies Congress and the  Presidency. \\u201cThe middle has shifted for the Republican Party in the House,\\u201d Mr. Thurber  said. \\u201cThe data don't show that the middle has shifted in the country.\\u201d  Though it is still not clear from this frame if Thurber has relevant and current peer reviewed research into the topic of discussion, it is at least much clearer than if he had simply been identified as a \\u201cpolitical scientist\\u201d that he is in the right ballpark. A reader knows that Thurber studies Congress, rather than some unrelated topic of political science like international aid to the developing world or the emergence of the feminist movement.  This an improvement over the discipline frame, though readers still don\\u2019t really know precisely what it is that Thurber studies. As it happens, Thurber\\u2019s research on Congress in the decade or so before this article was printed was mostly concerned with congressional/presidential relationships, which seems at least broadly appropriate; again, though, Rosenbaum would have been the best positioned, when writing the article, to make that even clearer.  Here is another effective example of the specialist frame, from Monica Davey\\u2019s September 29th 2009 article \\u201cHealth Care Overhaul and Mandatory Coverage Stir States' Rights Claims\\u201d:  Mark A. Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University who has studied the 43  constitutionality of mandates that people buy health insurance, said, ''There is no way this challenge will succeed in court,'' adding that the state measures seemed more \\u201csort of an act of defiance, a form of civil disobedience if you will.\\u201d  On the one hand, a reader of the above passage has substantial assurance that Hall has applicable research to the topic at hand, in this case laws passed in some states pre-emptively attempting to outlaw, a significant part of the health care reform legislation that was then pending in Congress (Manchikanti et al. 2011, 35). But on the other, it also highlights the absurdity of not telling the reader, in so many words, precisely what that research is -- Mark Hall\\u2019s \\u201cThe Constitutionality of Mandates to Purchase Health Insurance\\u201d was published in the Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics about a month before this article was written; the article could have explicitly stated this while barely changing a word.  Indeed, it seems quite clear that the authors of the news articles chose not to relay what they knew about the source\\u2019s research -- indeed, it seems very likely that Bailey contacted Hall because of the article he had just published. When the title of the article is paraphrased almost verbatim, why not make that connection transparent? The author frame  As mentioned above, I found a small number of academic quotes in the sample from articles that were pegged on a piece of research or a study. There were eight instances of this, all but 44  one of which contained clear reference to the peer review status of the article.  Here is an example, from a July 21st 1994 article without a by-line entitled \\u201cStudy Predicts Large Surplus of Physicians\\u201d:  The United States will have a surplus of 165,000 doctors by the year 2000, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported today in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  More than 90 percent of the surplus doctors will be specialists and 40 percent of all  medical specialists could be unnecessary by the year 2000, the author said, adding that  that underscored the need for medical schools to push students into family and  community medicine.  \\\"Many medical students, given the choice of high-paying specialties with salaries two to  three times that of primary care, make the obvious choice,\\\" said Jonathan Weiner,  associate professor of health policy and management.  While this example bears many of the characteristics of the sort of peer review framing I was looking for, it is manifestly different for one simple reason: in the constructions I was examining primarily, academic sources are quoted because they provide expertise but are not 45  stakeholders in the stories they are commenting on. Conversely, in articles that are actually about discrete works of research (which in my cataloguing of the data I have been referring to as \\u201cstudy articles\\u201d), authors are not outside commentators but instead key actors in the story.  All that said, however, the small number of examples collected here of study articles suggest that this format of news article is far more likely in its existing conventions of reporting to provide readers with sufficient information to evaluate their academic credibility. This is a clear avenue of future research. Quotations directly from research  Additionally, academic studies were quoted 17 times in the sample without any direct commentary from their authors. As with study articles I recorded these but considered them to be a substantively different phenomenon from academic commentary. That said, I was surprised to find that, like academic quotations and unlike study articles, direct quotation of academic research contained reference to its peer review status relatively infrequently: in only three of these instances was the peer review status of the studies quoted clear. I say surprising because I had supposed that a study\\u2019s place of publication would be considered essential information when quoting from it.  Certainly it did not seem onerous or intrusive to include in the articles that did so. For instance this, from Craig Whitney\\u2019s November 14th 1993 article \\u201cHow Others Do It: Germany; Coverage 46  For All, With Choices\\u201d:  Also, according to a study by John K. Iglehart in The New England Journal of Medicine,  \\\"German hospitals have fewer pieces of high-technology equipment than most big  urban  hospitals in the United States.\\\"  For a counterexample, a study quotation without reference to its peer review status, see this article by David Rosenbaum from October 26th 1993, called \\u201cEconomic Outlaw: American Healthcare\\u201d:  To illustrate that point, researchers at Dartmouth Medical School tried to determine how patients would respond if they were thoroughly informed about various possible treatments. The researchers found, for example, that when they used videotapes and other techniques to explain carefully the advantages and disadvantages of prostate surgery, the number of patients at the Veterans Administration hospital in White River Junction, Vt., who decided against having such surgery increased significantly.  It is clear in this example that it would not have been difficult for Rosenbaum to have included a simple phrase telling readers what the study was called and where it was published, but he chose not to. As it stands, there is not even enough information for an interested reader to look up the article independently; after some sleuthing I believe that the study being referred to 47  was \\u201cDeveloping shared decision-making programs to improve the quality of health care\\u201d by Kasper, Mulley, and Wennberg, published in 1992 in Quality Review Bulletin 18:6. But I\\u2019m only somewhat confident in this guess -- certainly it can be said, though, that knowing next to nothing about the study based on only the article itself, it is hard to give its much credibility to what it reports it as saying.  However, in this example and indeed all the other studies quoted directly there was at least a short description of either how the study worked or what it found; at the very least this can be said to be at base more informative than the professional and discipline frames. 48  Conclusions and recommendations  When a journalist quotes someone, it is essential that it be clear for the reader who the source is and why their opinion matters -- academic expertise is only one of a myriad of reasons a journalist might choose to quote an individual in a news story, but it is a potent one, carrying substantial authority (Page et al. 1987, 39).  But unlike that of many types of expertise, academic credibility is derived from a fairly cohesive institution, and within that institution there is a system by which to determine who is qualified to speak on which topics: peer review.  Peer review is the preferred method of internal validation in the academy for good reason; it is also a very good way for readers and journalists to reassure themselves about an academic source\\u2019s expertise; it is not infallible (Henderson 2010, 738), but it seems likely that it is the best mechanism easily available for such a function (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269).  In a perfect world, how credible a source is wouldn\\u2019t matter because everything they are quoted as saying would be independently verifiable. In reality, the things academic sources are actually quoted saying are often non-factive or otherwise difficult to evaluate (Conrad 1999, 292). In these cases sources\\u2019 personal credibility is the only metric by which a reader can decide how much stock to place in their utterances. Thus, how sources are presented to readers is 49  incredibly important; scant information could lead readers to doubt trustworthy sources, or conversely trust the expertise of a source who might not merit it.  However, it is clear from the data that in coverage by America\\u2019s preeminent paper of one of the highest-stakes political discussions in the country, the health care debate, academics were simply not framed clearly or transparently. Most were portrayed by way of their institutional positions and/or their broad disciplines of study, methods dramatically inadequate to express how and why an academic has applicable expertise on a topic.  This broad failure to adequately back up claims of academic expertise leaves readers vulnerable to active attempts to spread misinformation, as documented in coverage of climate change and tobacco health by Conway and Oreskes (2010) and Hoggan and Littlemore (2009). On a topic as politically heavy as health care reform, it is by no means difficult to imagine that similar attempts to misinform were made.  Even without deceptive behaviour, opaque framing also risks simple mismanagement of academic sources. Academics are highly educated and will thus often be broadly knowledgeable in a variety of fields, and as human beings many will have opinions on subjects that they in fact know nothing about at all. But actual academic expertise is an inch wide and a mile deep, subject at least in theory to constant checks and updates. A journalism which fails to recognize this will fail to take advantage of the real advantages that academic knowledge can 50  provide, while misassigning academic prestige where it is not warranted.  The public discourse suffers when the information presented by the news media is unreliable \\u2013 a journalism that aims to inform the public would therein be failing if its sources, vital to the construction of journalistic knowledge, could not be trusted.  There appears to be a journalistic format already in existence which is more inclined to portraying academic knowledge transparently and credibly: the study article. Perhaps as a simple accident of the work process that generates them, or perhaps due to different beliefs about their intended audiences, articles of this genre seem much more inclined to take the time to explain study\\u2019s content and pedigree. Though the study article format is not universally applicable \\u2013 if nothing else it is of no use to a journalist who wants to report on a topic that hasn\\u2019t already been through academic inquiry \\u2013 it is nevertheless noteworthy that there is a genre of news that appears, at least from this small sample, to already manage academic sources quite adeptly.  But even in conventional news articles, it would not take a revolution in reporting technique to close this gap. In many cases, perhaps even most, it seems likely that the reporters were personally aware of their source\\u2019s peer reviewed research, but simply chose not to pass that information on to their readers. If a reporter walks into an interview without already knowing 51  anything his or her source\\u2019s academic background, it doesn\\u2019t seem unreasonable to simply ask to be directed to some of the source\\u2019s research in the field, or indeed to look it up back at the office. Information about a source\\u2019s scholarship is not difficult to obtain, and it would require minimal changes in a journalist\\u2019s professional routines to start incorporating it into the frames used to present academic sources to the public. But such a change would greatly improve the transparency and thus, I believe, enhance the credibility of the articles produced.  52  References  Allan, Stuart. 2009. The Future of Science Journalism.

Joe instructed me on how to put together a solid content analysis of the news media.  I also want to thank my secondary reader Ben Parfitt.  Ben\\u2019s expertise in my research area made the process of understanding and analysing forest policy in British Columbia much easier. The School of Journalism has provided endless support over the past two years.  Barbara Wallin was particularly encouraging and it was always reassuring to know she was there.  My colleagues at the school have been wonderful, providing professional support and friendship along this journey.  I\\u2019d also like to acknowledge the various funding bodies that enabled me to pursue graduate studies -- the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the School of Journalism and the University of British Columbia. i i     vii      1   In 2008, the British Columbia government released the BC Bionergy Strategy.  This strategy committed the government to putting $25 million towards establishing a provincial Bioenergy Network that would invest in new bioenergy projects and technologies.  It also mandated a BC Hydro two-part call for bioenergy power, and called for the development of ten community energy projects to be fired by biomass by 2020.  This strategy was developed as an offshoot of the BC Energy Plan which was developed by the Liberal government in 2007, and which sets strong environmental targets in an effort to fight the effects of climate change.  The province\\u2019s goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 33% below 2007 levels by the year 2020.  It also planned to ensure that all new electricity generation projects would produce no greenhouse gas emissions, that the province would become energy self-sufficient by 2016, and that it would continue to produce 90% of its electricity through clean and renewable methods.  The plan called for the development of the BC Bioenergy Strategy to: \\u201ctake advantage of B.C.\\u2019s abundant sources of renewable energy, such as beetle-killed timber, wood wastes and agricultural residues,\\u201d (BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources BC energy plan outlines vision 2).  Using wood fiber to produce energy was not a new concept for the province.  For years, many of the province\\u2019s pulp mills had burned mill residues, or waste, to power their facilities (BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources The BC energy plan 2).  What changed was the idea that this technology could be used to provide power for other energy consumers.  A facility could generate power, and BC Hydro would sell that power to customers around the province. i      2   Wood bioenergy combines two resource based industries in the province: the forest industry and the energy industry.  Together, the two industries contribute about 12% to the province\\u2019s gross domestic product (Hoberg 332).  The nature of the industries and their role within the province has been changing in recent years.  The forest industry has experienced a sharp decline in revenues because of the economic downturn in the United States and a precipitous drop in housing starts and lumber demand.  In addition, the forest industry has dealt with the outbreak of the mountain pine beetle epidemic (Hoberg 339).  Since the 1980s, the energy industry has been moving towards privatization and deregulation, and premier Gordon Campbell and his Liberal government have been even more aggressive with this trend (Hoberg 347).  Since 2002, the construction and operation of new energy projects has been handled by independent power producers and without BC Hydro, the provincial crown corporation (331). British Columbia\\u2019s forest industry contributes about 7% to the province\\u2019s gross domestic product each year (Hoberg 332) making it a major contributor to provincial revenues.  The industry has experienced turmoil for years, but in 2007, the economic downturn began to be felt in the forest industry, and it suffered badly (Hoberg 340).  British Columbia\\u2019s forest industry is largely dependent on the U.S. market - wood products are exported to the United States and used in residential construction.  In 2007, the American housing market collapsed, and the demand for wood products plummeted.  At the time, the Canadian dollar had risen compared to the U.S. dollar, making Canadian lumber products even less attractive to potential buyers.   In addition to other market factors, the price of lumber dropped, meaning little revenue was made from the lumber that did sell (Hoberg 341).  In 2006, Canada capitulated to the United States and established the Softwood Lumber i i     3  Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America.  This agreement included a condition where taxes to export wood products to the United States would increase as the amount of wood exported decreased (Parfitt Softwood 6). The agreement also removed the policy of appurtenancy -- where companies that were given the right to cut down publicly owned trees in British Columbia had to support local sawmills by processing the wood in that region (Parfitt Softwood 3).  Further change to the industry came with the introduction of a market-based pricing system for wood -- a Liberal campaign promise and an essential step toward establishing the agreement (Parfitt Softwood 9). This new trade agreement with the United States compounded the impact of the market collapse for the forest industry.  Between 2007 and 2008, 20,000 forestry workers lost their jobs -- sawmill workers were affected particularly badly (Hoberg 332).  The decline in the forest industry has had major implications for forest practices.  The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives published a report examining the amount of usable wood being cut down and wasted at logging sites across British Columbia.  It was reported that 17.5 million cubic metres of usable wood was left behind between 2004 and 2008 (Parfitt Shortchanged 1).  The carbon content in this wood stream is equivalent to about 3.23 million tonnes, which if totally released to the atmosphere would add another 5% to British Columbia\\u2019s total carbon emissions (Parfitt Shortchanged 1).  In conjunction with the economic crisis, British Columbia is experiencing an environmental crisis.  The mountain pine beetle is expected to kill 80% of the province\\u2019s merchantable pine by 2013 (BC Ministry of Forest and Range 2).  As of fall 2009, roughly 620 million cubic meters of timbre, about 45% of the pine, had been killed (Hamilton).  Once killed this pine has a shelf-life, or a period of time the wood is still commercially valuable.  The minimum shelf-life predicted for beetle-killed wood is five years, the maximum is twenty years, v      4  but generally the trees are thought to be commercially valuable for up to twelve years (BC Ministry of Forest and Range 11).  The forest industry in British Columbia is at a critical point (Forest Products Association of Canada 1).  After a sharp decline in the industry as a result of the economic downturn, stakeholders are struggling to find new uses for the forests. At the same time, the climate change crisis is pushing citizens and governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Historically, the province has taken resources out of the forests to sell as wood products.  Now there is a movement to find ways to use the economic value of the carbon stored in trees and reduce the environmental impact of forestry practices.  The provincial government has endorsed the idea of using wood to produce a clean energy: bioenergy.  The targets set by the provincial government maintains that its energy plan can be partially fulfilled using bioenergy technologies.  This study explores the technology that burns wood to produce electricity and heat; other forms of bioenergy such as wind, solar, tidal, etc. are not dealt with in this report.  Wood bioenergy is an interesting subject because it has the potential to provide growth for the forest industry -- an industry that is currently in decline.  Since the BC Energy Plan was announced in 2007, BC Hydro has awarded four wood bioenergy contracts to generate 500 gigawatt hours of energy in 2008 - roughly the energy consumed by 50,000 households annually.  In 2010, the provincial crown corporation wants to secure contracts that will supply an additional 1,000 gigawatt hours of electricity (Parfitt Managing 18).     5   Different groups involved in the forest industry foresee a growing bioenergy industry affecting them in different ways.  The pulp and paper industry is concerned about the use of mill residues, meaning the waste created from processing wood --sawdust, chips and shavings -- for bioenergy.   The pulp and paper industry has been using these materials to make a product for decades.  It is worried that increasing the number of bioenergy facilities will drive up the price of these materials, making the pulp and paper industry no longer economically viable (Parfitt Managing 18).  The use of logging residues, the waste created from harvesting trees, and pine beetle- killed trees for bioenergy is part of the BC Bioenergy Strategy (6).  Some researchers and environmentalists worry about the ecological impact of removing this material from the forests in addition to the normal wood harvest.  This group insists this wood is needed to help forests re- grow after being harvested (Chapman).  There also are concerns about the cost of salvaging bioenergy wood from mountain pine beetle-killed trees and the waste logs that Parfitt researched (Shortchanged).  The cost of taking this wood out of the forest and transporting it to a facility may only be economically viable if the facility is a short distance from the wood source.  The price consumers pay for electricity is so low that power producers want a guarantee that it would still be economically beneficial (Clarke).  This technology also becomes less environmentally friendly, the further the wood is transported because of the greenhouse gases produced in transportation (Parfitt Managing 23).  If a company pursues a bioenergy project there is the need to have a constant supply of fuel or wood.  The industry is looking for a guarantee that it will continue to have access to the province\\u2019s publicly owned trees in the long term -- after the pine beetle-killed wood has been used and logging residues are not as readily available.  This is a concern from an i      6  environmentalist perspective; environmentalists want to preserve the forests, meanwhile companies that traditionally harvest the forest also need access to these trees (Parfitt Managing 24).  British Columbia has an abundance of trees, making wood bioenergy a seemingly obvious choice for \\u201cgreen\\u201d energy production in the province. Furthermore, forests re-grow making bioenergy a renewable form of energy.  But, once planted, trees must stay standing long enough to provide enough ecological benefits to be considered a renewable resource.  These benefits include carbon storage which generally increases as trees get older (Parfitt Managing 29).  Wood bioenergy is often said to be carbon neutral.  The reason for this being that the carbon released by burning wood is absorbed by living trees.  Parfitt has found that this is not necessarily true.  When trees are cut down and turned into wood products, they continue to store carbon.  But when trees are burned to produce energy, that carbon is immediately released into the atmosphere.  Furthermore, if the wood residues are left in the forest after harvesting, carbon is released as the wood decomposes but it is released slowly over time and some of the carbon remains tied up in nature without being released (Managaing 22).  The Vancouver Sun, the largest circulating province-wide daily newspaper in British Columbia, has both energy and forest beat reporters, indicating the importance of these two industries to the province.  How this newspaper presents wood bioenergy is important because of the government\\u2019s movement toward investing money and resources in to developing bioenegy projects. i i     7   This study shows that The Vancouver Sun has been following the growth of the bioenergy industry in British Columbia.  The public relies on the news media to learn about issues and events (Lippman 22), thus it is important to study how ideas are presented.  This paper explores how The Vancouver Sun has presented wood bioenergy to the public and how this has changed over time.  This paper goes on to suggest how this can affect the public\\u2019s understanding of a subject and the public\\u2019s beliefs and feelings toward it. Nuclear energy  Nuclear energy provides an example of where the news media focused on certain aspects of a new technology, only to drastically change how it was represented twenty years later (Palfreman, 2006).  In the 1950s, nuclear energy became a source of electricity and two vastly different view points existed about the industry.  As an energy source, nuclear energy can provide a plentiful supply of energy, but nuclear physics can also be used to make weapons. Palfreman (25) says both of these viewpoints were well known in the 1950s but most of the media coverage about nuclear energy was positive or neutral.  In 1966, there was a meltdown at a nuclear reactor near Detroit.  It was a serious accident, but one the press didn\\u2019t explore.  During the 1973 oil crisis, many stories focused on the energy generating potential of nuclear physics (Palfreman 25).  By the mid 1970s, nuclear energy was being presented differently - the negative aspects were presented in the news coverage.  The news media started presenting the views of physicists opposed to nuclear energy and protesters as well as the dangers of nuclear physics - explosions and radiation (Palfreman 26).  Nuclear energy illustrates how a story can be framed and how those frames may i i i    8  transform over time.  As the technology was emerging, nuclear energy was framed as a solution to an energy crisis.  Within a couple of decades the frames changed, and the news was dominated by the dangers of nuclear physics.  Certain actors gained support and became more vocal. Images of the destruction caused by nuclear weapons became prominent and there were accidents at nuclear power plants to act as focusing events.  This frame transformation is not unique to nuclear energy.  Using corn to produce ethanol and making a biofuel or bioediesel was a popular idea, a supposedly green technology.  Recently, the media coverage of the use of corn to produce fuel has changed to discuss the issues of an emerging food crisis and using agricultural land to produce a fuel.  There are multiple actors who have a stake in the growing bioenergy industry in British Columbia and each has a different perspective on the issue.  This content analysis should provide insight into whose perspective is being used as a frame for the news on bioenergy and if this frame has changed throughout the Liberal government\\u2019s leadership.  Wood bioenergy is being framed in two ways. One - wood bioenergy is the solution to the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Two - wood bioenergy is a green energy that is carbon neutral. To examine this hypothesis, this study asked the following questions  Were the following terms used: \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d or a derivate such as \\u201cgreenhouse gas neutral\\u201d \\u201cgreen energy\\u201d \\u201crenewable\\u201d \\u201cmountain pine beetle\\u201d or \\u201cpine beetle\\u201d or \\u201cmountain pine beetle-killed timber\\u201d   Does the article discuss how bioenergy works?  Does the article discuss wood bioenergy in the future?  Does the article address reforestation/rehabilitation?  Does the article address carbon balance?  x      9   One of the longstanding ideas about the role of the news media is that it defends the principles of democracy.  Walter Lippmann wrote that journalists were responsible for conveying news and information to the public.  Journalists act as the link between the policymakers and the public.  The news is a particularly important source of political information for the public (Iyengar Responsible 8).   The pubic turns to the news for information, and Lippmann believed that news forms public opinion (22).  Lippmann was quick to explain that this doesn\\u2019t mean the public is getting pure information.  The journalist does not witness the news; reporters depend on sources to act as witnesses.  News is second hand and is not an exact account; it is a representation of the story. This means that public opinion isn\\u2019t formed by events but by how those events are told. Lippmann draws on Plato\\u2019s philosophies and explains that the news media puts pictures in our heads and those pictures give us impressions of our external world.  The public responds to those impressions, or pseudo-environments, not the real environment.  This means news acts by instructing public opinion (Lippmann 12).   One of the ideals of journalism is that news should be presented in an objective way.  The method used to produce journalism should be transparent and the journalist should try to get the best information available (Kovach and Rosentiel 81-110).  News that is truthful and objective helps establish trust between the media and the public, the people the news media try to serve (Kovach and Rosentiel 52-3).  Despite news media\\u2019s efforts to be objective, it still has the power     10  to influence its audience.  There are three well established news media effects: agenda setting, priming and framing.  Maxwell McCombs, a prominent agenda-setting theorist, has also written about how agenda setting and framing can work together. Other effects have been discussed throughout the literature including the news media as informers, persuaders and the so called \\\"bandwagon effect\\\" that refers to political campaigns.  This study focused on the idea of framing and details about the other effects are not included in this report. A brief description of agenda- setting and priming is included below to help demonstrate how the framing effect is different.  McCombs first found evidence of the agenda-setting effect in the 1968 presidential election (McCombs and Shaw 177).  He found an almost perfect correlation in rank order between the issues that voters felt were most important during the election and the amount of news coverage those issues received. Agenda setting suggests that news media tell the audience what issues are important by focusing on those issues in their coverage.  Essentially, the volume of coverage is what matters - news coverage affects the salience of an issue on the agenda (McCombs and Shaw 186).  With extensive news coverage of an issue, the audience believes it has more importance nationally (Iyengar Responsible 133).  Priming, like agenda setting, has to do with the extent of news coverage.  The difference is that it specifically influences an audience\\u2019s political judgments.  Iyengar explains that news coverage affects the criteria used to evaluate political leaders (Responsible 133).  The best way to understand priming is with an example.  In the 1992 presidential election, the media focused on the economy in their coverage, and president George Bush lost the election to Bill Clinton. When asked, most voters said the state of the economy was the reason that they voted against Bush (Miller and Krosnick 265).  The authours suggest that if the media had focused on the triumph of the Gulf War, the outcome of the election may have been different. i      11    Framing as an effect of news media will be discussed to a greater extent because of its importance to this study.  Framing is discussed throughout social science literature and can be found in psychology, sociology, public opinion and political research.  Framing relates to the idea of how an issue is presented, which aspects of the issue are highlighted and in what context.  Todd Gitlin wrote about framing in the context of how the media portrayed Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) - the group that organized the first national demonstration against the Vietnam war in 1965 and that Gitlin was once president of.  Gitlin says framing is a way of seeing an event: \\u201cJournalism\\u2019s more regular approach is to process social opposition, to control its image and to diffuse it at the same time, to absorb what can be absorbed into the dominant structure of definitions and images and to push the rest to the margins of social life\\u201d (5).  Iyengar (Overview 214) explains framing as \\u201ca more subtle form of media influence, associated not with the amount of news but the manner of presentation.\\u201d  To Gitlin, frames are about selection and this selection works in various places.  He says frames help journalists do their job in reporting the news, and help news consumers understand the news (Gitlin 98). This means a journalist will take an issue and package it a certain way.  In the news media, journalists construct a frame based on ideology, attitudes and professional norms (Scheufele 109).  Gitlin (100) says this often happens because of the time constraints put on journalists and because of pack-journalism where journalists from different organizations follow the same angle of a story.  Scheufele (115) says the medium where the news is published also influences the frame through its political orientation and organizational routines.   Scheufele (115) argues that external sources of information, especially stakeholders and actors, are the third influence on the frame -- this is described in more detail below.  It has also been reported that a frame is what makes an issue interesting; it defines the story (Reese 13). i i     12   Agenda setting built on Lippmann\\u2019s ideas of the images in our heads by explaining why reporters and audiences think about those images.  Framing goes beyond Lippmann\\u2019s ideas of how personal perceptions are used to process the news media (Entman 52).   Agenda setting makes an issue more salient. Framing selects certain parts of the issue to become more salient. This puts the issue in context by explaining what the problem is, what caused the problem, how to judge its effects and how it should be evaluated or fixed (Entman 52).  It also means that part of the picture is left out.  Iyengar (Responsible 11) argues that the framing of an issue is a \\u201ccontextual cue\\u201d and that these cues influence opinions and decisions.  He distinguishes between the two parts of this process; framing is different from a framing effect. Framing explains how an issue is presented, and the effect is how this changes a decision or opinions (Responsible 11). Iyengar stresses that this power to influence is not limited to naive or ignorant audiences - news directly affects public opinion of everyone (Responsible 130).  Iyengar (Responsible 14) breaks up news frames into two categories: episodic news frames and thematic news frames.  Episodic frames discuss an issue in the context of an event -- it's an illustration of the subject.  Episodic framing results in making the acts or characteristics of individuals more accessible (Iyengar Responsible 14).  Thematic framing discusses an issue within a broader context.  Thematic framing occurs more often in print media than in television, and it \\u201chelps audiences to think about political issues in terms of societal and political outcomes\\u201d (Iyengar Responsible 14).  This study addressed how wood bioenergy was presented in a newspaper over nine years -- and focused on the framing trends that emerged in that time.   It did not try to break the frames into the two separate categories Iyengar discusses.  One way to identify a frame is to identify the voices that are being heard in the news (Tankard 101).  When it comes to public policy, issues generally have many stakeholders. Tankard (96) argues that media framing eliminates voices.  When an issue gets onto the public i i i    13  agenda, stakeholders start trying to frame it and establish a specific point of view (Miller and Reichert 108). They do this by highlighting certain aspects of the issue and leaving out others. The media will turn to these stakeholder groups to be used as sources in a news piece, and the group\\u2019s point of view becomes the frame (Miller and Reichert 108).  In an analysis of television network coverage of the Gulf War, more than 50% of all news reports came directly from official government spokespersons (Iyengar and Simon 256).  This practice of using the government \\u201cparty-line\\u201d for news means that the government gets to frame the issue.  This affects the public\\u2019s understanding and opinions of the issue.  The audience's feelings toward an issue will be similar to the government\\u2019s position (Iyengar and Simon 256).   Entman (52) explains that studying the presence or absence of key words or phrases, images, sources of information and facts or judgments used to reinforce a theme, can also identify frames.  McCombs\\u2019 first works on agenda setting built off the phrase coined by Bernard Cohen (13), that the press \\u201cmay not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about.\\u201d  But, as the body of research on framing grew, McCombs worked to show how agenda setting and framing worked as one theory (McCombs and Estrada 239).  McCombs claims that framing is the second dimension of agenda setting.  Together, agenda setting tells the audience what to think about and framing tells the audience how to think about these issues (McCombs and Estrada 246).  Wood bioenergy has existed in the province for a long time, but it only became a part of policy in 2007, when the BC Energy plan was released under the Liberal government.  A content analysis was performed of The Vancouver Sun\\u2019s newspaper coverage of wood bioenergy in the province.  A content analysis provides quantitative data to identify themes and perspectives i v     14  expressed in a text (Bengston and Xu 2).  Bengston and Xu (2) argue a content analysis allows one to examine the language of a text, and that language reflects a society\\u2019s values and beliefs which in turn influence the way its members think and behave.  A content analysis also allows us to examine trends over a long period of time and asses the changes in those trends (Bengston and Xu 2). Sample collection  To analyze the news media, newspaper articles from The Vancouver Sun were collected. Print media allows readers to control what they read by allowing them to select which articles they want to read, how much time they want to spend on the article and what information the reader takes away from the article.  This is different from broadcast news where a person has no choice over which pieces of news are given to them and they are forced to consume the news in a predetermined order and within a limited timeframe (Soroka 33).  Unfortunately, no recent data about consumption of forestry news by Canadians could be found.  In 1989, 51% of Canadians indicated that newspapers were their main sources of information on issues related to forestry (Environics Research Group).  The Vancouver Sun was selected as the source for newspaper articles because it is the largest daily province-wide newspaper in British Columbia, and it has the largest circulation of any paper in the province (Canadian Newspaper Association).  A provincial newspaper was used because wood bioenergy is part of the provincial government\\u2019s agenda - forests and energy fall under provincial jurisdiction.  If this were a national issue, national papers would be used (Soroka 35).  v      15  Data collection The articles were analyzed for general journalistic features: date, authour, location in paper, word count and article type.  This is a standard practice when doing a content analysis of how an issue is framed (Tankard 100).  Entman (52) explains that frames can also be identified by analyzing key words or phrases that come up often and those that are missing.  Facts or judgements can also be used to reinforce a theme (Entman 52).  Tankard (101) indicates that the lead of a story is a framing mechanism.  Often the lead explains the news element of the story although sometimes, especially with feature articles, the news is found in the nutgraph.  Miller and Reichert argue that an issue is framed in the news media based on which stakeholder group are used as sources and their point of view (108).  Tankard also identifies the selection of sources, affiliations and quotes as a framing mechanism (101).  The method for conducting the content analysis for this study was developed based on the framing mechanisms outlined by the researchers discussed above.  v i     16   Articles for this content analysis were found using a keyword search in Proquest\\u2019s Canadian Newsstand index.   Articles from The Vancouver Sun were found by performing the following searches: \\u201cwood waste,\\u201d \\u201cbioenergy,\\u201d \\u201cbiomass\\u201d and \\u201cwood AND energy.\\u201d Duplicates were removed, and in the case where different versions of the same story appeared in different editions of the paper, the longest story was selected.  The reason for selecting the longest story is that as much information as possible would have been presented to readers.  Searches for other key terms that the study was looking for such as \\u201cmountain pine beetle\\u201d and \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d were excluded because the number of articles produced was too great to pick out the few articles that would align with the study\\u2019s subject.  Similar searches for \\u201cmountain pine beetle\\u201d and \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d with all the same parameters provided about 800 results each.  The initial set of articles was reduced further throughout the analysis when articles appeared that did not discuss wood bioenergy.  This often occurred if a person in an article had the name \\\"Wood,\\\" or the article was about waste from building materials, gardening or real estate.  Other articles were removed because they focused on biofuels.  This analysis was only interested in looking at the use of wood to produce power, not to produce gasoline for vehicles. In the instance that an article discussed the use of wood to produce a gas that could be used instead of natural gas, the article was kept in the data set.  In total 242 articles were analyzed.  Articles were retrieved starting from June 6, 2001, and ending December 31, 2009.  On June 6, 2001, Gordon Campbell\\u2019s Liberal government took power; the Liberal government has v i i    17  been very active in changing forest policy in the province.  Examples of some of the articles used in this analysis can be found in Appendix A.  The articles were analyzed for general journalistic features: date, authour, location in paper, word count and article type.  The type of articles were broken into four categories: news, feature, opinion/editorial and brief.  News articles have a sense of timeliness to them - news tends to report on important happenings within the preceding 24 hours.  The news must be gathered quickly and the information must be new, fresh and immediate (Garst and Bernstein 4). Feature stories lack the sense of timeliness, which means the information is newsworthy, but the story could appear on any particular day.  It could run tomorrow, the day after or even within the following weeks (Lanson and Stephens 343).  The section of the newspaper the articles are found in usually identifies opinions and editorials.  This category includes editorials - unattributed articles generally assumed to represent the institutional voice of the newspaper, letters to the editor, and columns which are attributed to a writer but express a distinct personal view.  For the purpose of analyzing the average word count of the articles over the course of each year, two articles 1  were removed from the data set.  These articles contained more than 4,000 words each and significantly skewed the data.  They are considered outliers.  The data collected from these articles for other parts of the analysis was left in the data set.   This paper analyzed the articles to determine which actors were quoted or used as sources the most frequently.  A group was quoted if a quote from spokesperson in that group was included in the article.  A group was mentioned if sources or information from that group were included in the article. Hessing identifies politicians, environmentalists, First Nations, industry representatives and labour groups as the major actors in BC forestry (121-31).  This study added  1  . Hume, Stephen. \\u201cAlternative energies will fill the void after the end of oil.\\u201d 15 June 2001.; Boei, William. \\u201cThe new suburbia.\\u201d 6 September 2003.) v i i i   18  BC Hydro as an actor in the analysis because of the provincial crown corporation\\u2019s important role in the bioenergy industry.  A politician was defined as an elected member of government or a bureaucrat (i.e. chief forester, deputy minister of forests).  These individuals have an interest in being re-elected and / or gaining revenue for the government.  A First Nation is a person who identifies himself or herself as having a First Nations heritage.  An environmentalist is a person who supports conservation and saving the environment.  An industry representative is a person who has an interest in obtaining security for companies working in the wood products sector (this can include the bioenergy) and includes individuals from these companies.  A labour group indicates a union or someone looking for job security for a number of people working in the forest/wood processing or energy industries (Hessing 125).  A BC Hydro actor was identified as someone who works for the crown corporation.  In the case that a person represents more than one of these categories, he or she was identified as a source for whatever message he or she was promoting.  For example a First Nation who has been elected to government but who wants to preserve the forests for the sake of the environment was classified as an environmentalist.  These individuals were classified as First Nations if they want to preserve the forest for the sake of their band\\u2019s cultural values or as a politician if they were talking about the forest in terms of an election issue.  In the case that an individual represents more than one category and expresses more than one message, two categories may be indicated.  It was expected that more than one of these sources would be quoted and mentioned in each article, it is unusual to find an article with only one voice.  The wood fiber for energy production can come from a variety of waste sources including mountain pine beetle-killed trees, logging residues, mill residues, and urban waste.  The articles were analyzed to determine which source of wood was discussed in the article. i x     19   The forest industry is most active in rural British Columbia, along the coast and the interior of the province.  The urban population, centralized in the lower mainland and Victoria, has more voters and represent the environmental voters (Hoberg 337).  The location that the articles focus on was assessed in the content analysis. Urban areas were defined as Victoria, Vancouver and the lower mainland.  Rural areas of the province were defined as anything that is not urban including large cities in the interior of the province such as Prince George.  The context in which the bioenergy articles were written was analyzed as part of the content analysis.   Articles were separated into seven categories: the Ministry of Forest and Range made an announcement or began a bioenergy project; BC Hydro made an announcement or began a bioenergy project; a new policy was introduced about bioenergy; research was conducted on bioenergy; the industry began a new bioenergy project or made an announcement about the industry; a new facility was announced or started work; or some other context.  In the case where more than one of these categories would describe the article, they were both indicated.  Using wood as biomass is a contentious issue in the province (Parfitt Managing).   There are benefits to the technology but concerns about its economic sustainability and its impact on forest workers and the health of the forests.  The articles were studied to determine if any of the challenges for the bioenergy industry or any conflicting views were mentioned in the article.  An article was classified as including a conflict or challenge if it made any reference to a problem within a project or the industry.  Along with the above criteria, the articles were examined based on the questions asked in the Introduction of this paper:   x      20    Were the following terms used:  \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d or a derivative such as \\u201cgreenhouse gas neutral\\u201d \\u201cgreen energy\\u201d \\u201crenewable\\u201d \\u201cmountain pine beetle\\u201d or \\u201cpine beetle\\u201d or \\u201cmountain pine beetle-killed timber\\u201d    Does the article discuss how bioenergy works? This means at least two sentences were dedicated to explaining how wood is burned to produce energy.   Does the article discuss wood bioenergy in the future? This means the article addressed bioenergy 20 years in the future.  Twenty years was selected because it represents the upper shelf-life limit of the mountain pine beetle-killed wood (BC Ministry of Forests and Range 11).   Does the article address reforestation/rehabilitation? The BC Ministry of Forests and Range defines reforestation as the planting of forests on lands that have recently previously contained forests.  The article addressed reforestation/rehabilitation if there are at least two sentences dedicated to explaining how forests were restored in the passed or will be replanted or restored in the future.   Does the article address carbon balance? This means the article dedicated at least one sentence to describing how carbon was released from burning wood for bioenergy.  Alternatively the article could dedicate at least two sentences to explaining carbon sources, carbon sinks and the role of forests as carbon sinks.  Occasionally, this question was explained incorrectly in an article.  This happened frequently enough that it was counted separately. x i     21    Is wood bioenergy the focus of the story? Many of the articles mentioned wood bioenergy as part of a larger story.  An article was classified as focusing on wood bioenergy if more than half of the paragraphs discussed this idea.   Two masters of journalism candidates from UBC\\u2019s School of Journalism were given the methodology and ten randomly selected articles from the 242 used in the content analysis. They were asked to perform the analysis on each of the ten articles to test intercoder reliability. Intercoder reliability of 93% was achieved, indicating the analysis questions and definitions were appropriate for this report.  x i i    22   In total, 242 articles met the criteria for analysis.  Of that sample 25% of the articles discussed or focused on wood bioenergy for more than half of the paragraphs, while the remaining articles mentioned or dedicated a small portion of the article to discussing wood bioenergy (Figure 5).  The data were analyzed in its entirety, and the 60 articles that focused on the issue for over half the article were also isolated and analyzed separately.  The data were also separated into two time frames: 2001-2006 and 2007-2009.  The number of articles discussing wood bioenergy increased between 2001 and 2009 (Figure 1).  Because Gordon Campbell and his Liberal government did not take office until June 6, 2001, articles were only obtained starting from that date.  Seven articles were written about bioenergy between June and December of 2001.  Between 2002 and 2004, the number of articles ranged from 11 \\u2013 15 per year.  In 2005, there was an increase in the number of articles, totaling 25 that year.  Another spike occurred in 2007, when 48 articles were written about wood bioenergy.  The number of articles in 2008 remained the same as 2007, and increased slightly to 51 in 2009. After the two articles mentioned in the \\u201cMethods\\u201d section were removed from the data set because they contained more than 4,000 words each, the length of the articles was found to be consistent over time (Figure 2).  News stories accounted for 120 of the articles, or about half of the data set Opinions and editorials were the second most common type of article at almost 24% followed by features making up 16% and briefs making up 11% (Figure 3). x i i i   23  Figure 1 - The number of articles about wood bioenergy in The Vancouver Sun between June 2001 and Dec. 2009  Figure 2 - The average number of words per article between 2001 and 2009    x i v    24   Of the 242 articles, Gordon Hamilton and Scott Simpson, The Vancouver Sun\\u2019s respective forestry and energy reporters wrote 40%.  The articles were split evenly between the two reporters; Hamilton, the forestry reporter, wrote five more articles on the subject than Simpson, the energy reporter.  The remaining 60% of articles were written by various reporters and editorial contributors (Table 1). Figure 3 - The type of article to discuss wood bioenergy in The Vancouver Sun - The authour of the articles in the data set Authour Number of artcles Percent of articles (%) Gordon Hamilton 51 21.07 Scott Simpson 46 19.01 Other 145 59.92  x v     25  Of the six groups of people interested in the wood bioenergy issue, industry came up the most frequently of any group.  Industry spokespeople were quoted 42% of the time and industry sources or information was included in 60% of the articles (Figure 4).  Individuals in government appeared second most frequently, followed by B.C. Hydro.  Environmentalists were quoted in 8% of articles and information or sources from environmentalists were included in 15% of articles.  First Nations were quoted in 1% of articles and the information or sources about the group appeared in almost 5%.  Labour was quoted the least and discussed the least at less than 1% and just over 2% of the time respectively.  In 38% of articles no group was quoted and in 12% of articles none of the groups were mentioned. Of the 242 articles analyzed, 19% referred to a conflict or challenge of the wood bioenergy industry.  In the group of articles that dedicated more than half the article to discussing wood bioenergy, this number increased to 33% (Figures 5 and 6). The articles were analyzed for terms that play into the idea of burning wood as an environmentally friendly method of energy production.  In the data set, the term \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d was used in 9% of the time, \\u201cgreen energy\\u201d was used in 26% of articles and \\u201crenewable\\u201d was used in 18% of articles.  \\u201cCarbon neutral\\u201d was used more frequently in the articles where more than half the paragraphs dealt with wood bioenergy, 17%, than in the entire data set.   The terms \\u201cgreen energy\\u201d and \\u201crenewable\\u201d decreased in frequency when the more than half the article focused on the subject.    \\u201cGreen\\u201d was used to describe wood bioenergy in 17 % of the articles and \\u201crenewable\\u201d was used in 3% (Figures 5 and 6).  x v i    26   Figure 4 - The frequency that sources were quoted and mentioned in the articles         0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 P e rc e n ta g e  o f a rt ic le s to  a d d re ss  e a ch  s ta k e h o ld e r (% ) Groups with a stake in the forest industry Quoted Mentioned x v i i   27   Figure 5 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in the entire data set   0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% F re q u e n cy  o f y e s/ n o  a n sw e rs  t o  f ra m in g  q u e st io n s (% ) Subject of the question Wron g No x v i i   28   Figure 6 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in the data set of articles where more than half the article discussed wood bioenergy  In total 17% of the articles in this study mentioned the pine beetle-killed wood and wood bioenergy together in the same article.  This number increased to 33% when the selection of articles was limited to those that focused on wood bioenergy (Figures 5 and 6).  Only 3% of articles in the entire data set explained how wood could be used to produce clean energy but this number increased to 10% in articles that where more than half the article focused on wood bioenergy.  This was much higher than the number of times the future of the industry was discussed, which was once in the entire sample or less than 1% of the time.

Reforestation was also discussed in only one article in the entire selection and this article did not happen to focus on wood bioenergy (Figures 5 and 6).  Articles either explained carbon balance, did not explain it or explained it incorrectly to readers.  In total, five articles discussed carbon balance correctly, or 2%.  Three of these articles were in the group where more than half the paragraphs in the article were about wood bioenergy. Almost 5% of articles in the data set went into detail about carbon balance and wood bioenergy but presented the information incorrectly and 12% of the articles where bioenergy was the subject of more than half the article explained it incorrectly.  In total, 93% of all articles did not provide any details on carbon balance nor did 83% of the focused articles (Figures 5 and 6).  The articles were analyzed when they were broken into two time frames: 2001-2006 and 2007-2009.  Some of the information conveyed in the articles was not significantly different between the two time frames; other pieces of information were significantly different.  The number of articles that dealt with bioenergy for more than half the article remained fairly constant.  Throughout the data set about 25% of articles focused on bioenergy (Figure 5). Almost 29% of articles focused on bioenergy between 2001 and 2006; between 2007 and 2009, it was 24%.  Articles that explained how wood can be burned to produce energy and carbon balance also did not vary significantly between the two time frames.  The process of how bioenergy works was discussed in 2% of articles prior to 2007 and in 4% of articles in the second data set.  Carbon balance was explained correctly in 1% of articles prior to 2007 and in 2% of articles after that date (Figures 7 and 8).  Only one article in the data set discussed the future of the bioenergy industry and only one article discussed reforestation.  In each case these articles were found in the second data set, years 2007-2009. x x     30   The term \\u201cgreen energy\\u201d was used in about 26% of articles over the data set.  This did not change a great deal.  It was used only 22% of the time prior to 2007 and 28% of the time from 2007-2009 (Figures 7 and 8).  Differences were noted between the two time frames with the use of the terms \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d and \\u201crenewable\\u201d and how frequently the mountain pine beetle was discussed in conjunction with wood bioenergy.  Prior to 2007, the term \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d or variations of it, was used in 2% of the articles.  After 2007, the term was used in 13% of articles.  The term renewable was used in 11% of the articles analyzed prior to 2007.  This number doubles to 22% after 2007.  In 8% of the articles prior to 2007 mountain pine beetle-killed wood was discussed, but between 2007-2009 this number jumps to 24% (Figures 7 and 8).  The frequency that the conflicts or challenges of developing a wood bioenergy industry come up in articles, changes slightly between the two time frames and decreases in the later years.  Prior to 2007, 22% of articles discuss obstacles, while after 17% do the same.  Over the data set the conflicts or challenges are discussed 19% of the time (Figures 7 and 8). x x i    31  Figure 7 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in articles written between 2001 and 2006   0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% F re q u e n cy  o f y e s/ n o  a n sw e rs  t o  f ra m in g  q u e st io n s b e tw e e n  2 0 0 1 - 2 0 0 6  ( % ) Subject of question wrong no yes x x i i   32   Figure 8 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in articles written between 2007 and 2009 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% F re q u e n cy  o f y e s/ n o  a n sw e rs  t o  f ra m in g  q u e st io n s b e tw e e n  2 0 0 7 - 2 0 0 9  ( % ) Subject of question wrong now yes x x i i   33   The keyword searches for wood bioenergy articles yielded 242 articles for analysis between June 6, 2001, when Gordon Campbell\\u2019s Liberal government took power in the province, and the end of 2009.  When the data set is considered together, it does not support the study\\u2019s hypothesis that wood bioenergy is being framed as a carbon neutral energy source and as a solution to the mountain pine beetle epidemic.  But, when the data is analyzed for changes in trends over time, the study shows that the articles were more likely to be framed according to the hypothesis after 2007.  These trends are discussed in more detail below:  The number of articles written throughout each year of the analysis increased over time as was expected to happen.  The first big jump occurred in 2005, and there was another spike in 2007.   In 2007, the British Columbia government announced its goals to cut carbon emissions, become energy self-sufficient and use renewable energy (  1-2).  These policies were outlined in the BC Energy Plan and later, in 2008, the province released the BC Bioenergy Strategy.  BC Hydro collaborated with the government on these plans and targets. Following the release of these documents, BC Hydro put out two separate calls for project proposals and has accepted four projects by this study\\u2019s conclusion.  These actions explain why news coverage increased in 2007 and remained at that level.  In addition to provincial wood bioenergy projects, companies and groups are also beginning to use wood burning technology to produce power.  An example of this is the new Dockside Green development in Victoria.  This new neighbourhood is powered by Nexterra\\u2019s wood gasification system.  x x i v   34    Across the literature, researchers emphasized the importance of determining which voices were heard in the news media.  This study monitored how frequently the following groups were consulted by : government, BC Hydro, industry, labour, environmentalists and First Nations.  The most striking finding of this study revealed that the voice of Aboriginal groups was consistently missing in the articles about wood bioenergy.  When compared to the frequency that government voices are used as sources in the same set of articles, the elimination of First Nations\\u2019 voices is even more pronounced (Figure 4).  First Nations spokespeople were only quoted in about 1% of articles compared to government spokespeople, who were quoted 29% of the time.  Moreover government sources and information were included in more than 50% of wood bioenergy articles whereas Aboriginal sources were noted less than 5% of the time.  This polarity is particularly shocking when one considers the efforts the provincial government had gone to in recent years to work with First Nations in a more productive way. Establishing a \\u201cnew relationship\\u201d with First Nations was arguably the Liberal government\\u2019s biggest accomplishment and most significant change. ( ).   This \\u201cnew relationship\\u201d has been particularly important in the forestry sector. Delgamuukw, Haida, and Tsilhqot\\u2019in all had successful court cases throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s against the province and industry groups over lack of consultation (Palmer ).  The rulings from these cases indicated the fundamental importance of more fully consulting with and accommodating Aboriginal groups, especially when issues over the use of x x v    35  natural resources occurred on lands that they had claims to.  Gordon Campbell\\u2019s government responded by taking a new attitude toward First Nations groups (Palmer ). It was decided that consulting with First Nation groups prior to making forestry decisions was no longer sufficient because the individuals were more than just stakeholders.  Now, First Nations are analogous to the provincial government.  Other actions in the forestry sector also demonstrate the new relationship.  As part of the Forestry Revitalization Plan in 2004, 8% of the land taken back by the government to establish a market based pricing system, was given to First Nation groups (13-14).  This change has not been reflected in the reporting of wood bioenergy in  \\u2013 information about Aboriginal groups was only included in 5% of the articles. The impact of this in public opinion and policy is discussed in more detail below.  A limit of this study is that it does not explain why certain voices have been left out. Further research should aim to answer this question.  Specifically it would be important to study First Nation representation in the news across all forest topics to determine if the news media has reflected the changes in the province\\u2019s attitudes towards First Nations and, if not, to investigate the reasons for this.  This content analysis found that the voice of labour groups was also consistently left out. This was significant because of the number of forest and mill workers who have lost their jobs since 2007.  One frequent criticism of the wood bioenergy industry is the potential impact it might have on pulp and paper mills.  In the articles from  the sources of wood for bioenergy were most often mill residues and mountain pine beetle-killed wood. The use of mill residues as a source of bioenergy is the primary cause of concern for the pulp and paper industry.  Fiber from mills and the pine trees were each mentioned almost twice as often as any other source of wood for bioenergy. x x v i   36   The environmental actors were also consulted less frequently than other groups -- environmental quotes appeared in less than 10% of the articles and information and sources from that group was mentioned in about 15% of articles.  This finding was not surprising because of the current relationship between the forest industry and environmental groups.  After an agreement was reached to protect the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, environmentalists took a step back from focusing on forest issues.  Instead, groups such as Greenpeace focused on other environmental matters such as the tar sands.  First Nations, labour groups and environmentalists were thus unable to frame and shape how bioenergy initiatives were portrayed in The Vancouver Sun.  The opinions and attitudes of these groups were not found in the articles and thus the public does not have access to them. This means the public is getting a skewed or narrowly defined idea of the issues and concerns of using wood bioenergy.  The issues and concerns of First Nations, labour groups and environmentalists cannot influence the public opinion of this technology because they are not included in the articles being read by The Vancouver Sun audience.  The voices that are included determine public opinion and set the agenda (Lippmann 12).  They also determine the frame and decide the aspects of an issue that get discussed (Entman 52).  These frames play a role in the decisions that are made \\u2013 forming public policy. This study does not suggest that  intentionally left out First Nations, labour groups and environmentalists in an effort to frame bioenergy a certain way.  This study did not investigate why a quote from a group of actors was included or how the reporting was conducted.  This study only suggests that the audience of will not hear what these groups have to say about the growing bioenergy industry.  The omission of these voices may tie into why the conflicts and challenges of this industry were only discussed in about 20% of articles. x x v i   37   This study found that the voice of the industry, government and BC Hydro came up the most often in articles from (Figure 4).  Out of all groups, the industry\\u2019s voice is heard the most  industry was quoted in 42% of all articles.  This means the industry has a major role in setting the agenda and framing wood bioenergy (Lippmann 12). What is less clear is the position of the forest industry on wood bioenergy.  Economically the industry has been harmed by the financial situation in the United States and Canada, and there is reason to look for new and innovative revenue streams.  But, there are apprehensions about bioenergy development and the ability to secure long term access to trees.  It is hard to identify how this group would frame the issue because different voices in this group could be saying different things. It is also clear that BC Hydro and the government, who are in favour of promoting and developing wood bioenergy in the province, play a major role in determining the frame and setting the agenda.  These groups have initiatives in place to expand the wood bioenergy industry and want the public to support these plans.  This indicates that the aspects of wood bioenergy the government and BC Hydro would highlight would be the positive aspects.   The specific issues these groups have made more salient by being able to frame the issue are more clearly identified by looking at the second half of the study \\u2013 focusing on the language and messages that appear in the articles.  The first question used to analyze framing in bioenergy articles from examined the use of specific keywords and phrases.  In this study, the articles were analyzed for the following keywords: \\u201ccarbon neutral,\\u201d \\u201cgreen energy,\\u201d \\u201crenewable\\u201d and \\u201cmountain pine beetle.\\u201d  These words or phrases were identified as being in line with how the provincial government and BC Hydro wanted to frame the issue. x x v i   38   Overall these phrases were used in fewer than 50% of the articles, and even when more than half the content of an article discussed wood bioenergy, the frequency was low.   This was surprising until the data was isolated into two separate time periods.  Articles written prior to 2007 -- the year when the provincial government announced its new environmental initiatives and developed the BC Energy Plan -- were less likely to include the above keywords, while some of these keywords and phrases doubled in frequency after 2007 (Figure 7 and 8).  The most significant increase was observed in the use of the term \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d.  Prior to 2007, it was used in 2% of articles, and increased to being included in 13% of articles after 2007.  This is six times more frequently.  Renewable energy came up twice as frequently after 2007, appearing in 22% of articles.  References to mountain pine beetle-killed wood almost tripled, becoming a common phrase in about 24% of articles (Figure 8).  This indicates that the frame shifted around 2007 and wood bioenergy was discussed as a solution to environmental problems -- the message the government and BC Hydro have been promoting.  This change is particularly interesting when considered in conjunction with other analysis questions. As the terms \\u201ccarbon neutral,\\u201d \\u201crenewable\\u201d and \\u201cgreen energy\\u201d were used more frequently after 2007, it could be assumed that the terms would be qualified or explained.  For example using the term carbon neutral is almost useless without an explanation of the role of forests in maintaining carbon balance.  The term carbon neutral was used six times more frequently after 2007 while an explanation of carbon balance only increased from 1% to less than 3%.  No observable change was noticed in how frequently carbon balance was explained incorrectly across the two time periods -- this happened in around 5% of all articles. This suggests that  was using the language offered by the government without x x i x   39  trying to put it in context.  One of the provincial government\\u2019s energy policies says that all new electricity generation projects would produce no greenhouse gas emissions. Providing readers with context is one way to be objective in the news media (Kovach and Rosentiel 80-110).  The more objective the articles are, the less likely it is that the actors can frame an issue in the media and influence the opinion of the public. The articles frame burning wood as a carbon neutral practice, but they don\\u2019t make any effort to explain where this carbon comes from or the role that forests play in both storing and releasing carbon.  For the term \\u201crenewable\\u201d to make sense, it also needs to be qualified.  For trees to be considered a renewable resource means new trees have to be planted and allowed to grow for a specific amount of time.  This amount of time has been hotly debated -- trees should provide a minimum amount of ecological benefit to the area and should stand long enough to be a carbon sink (meaning the length of time a tree will continue to store more carbon than it produces).  It is believed that the longer a tree stands, the more carbon it stores (Parfitt  29). \\u201cRenewable\\u201d was used in twice as many articles after 2007, increasing from 11% to 22%.  While this term became more common in the discussion, only one article in the data set went into reforestation.  This was a surprising result because reforestation is the responsibility of the tenure holder, the group cutting down the trees, not nature.  Articles seem to lack context if trees are described as renewable without an explanation of who is responsible for this.  This finding indicates that  was framing bioenergy as a renewable energy resource.  One of the provincial government\\u2019s energy policies is that 90% of energy will come from renewable sources. l      40   Prior to 2007, 8% of articles discussed wood bioenergy in conjunction with mountain pine beetle-killed wood.  After 2007, almost 24% of articles did this.  When bioenergy and mountain pine beetle are discussed together, it gives the reader a sense that pine beetle killed- wood will be used for bionergy projects.  Despite the increase of this message in the news media over time, the bioenergy projects in the province do not reflect this increase.  As discussed earlier, the first call for bioenergy yielded no mountain pine beetle projects.  Approved projects from the second call for power were not announced prior to the study\\u2019s completion.  In conversations with Forest Minister Pat Bell, he explained that mountain pine beetle-killed wood will play a role in the future bioenergy industry but the majority of the wood fiber for bioenergy will come from logging residues.   This message is not consistent with previous statements from the ministry and provincial government (BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. 6) nor is it reflected in the news coverage of the issue.   This indicates that wood bioenergy is being framed as a solution to the mountain pine beetle epidemic.  Residents of British Columbia are aware of the damage caused by the mountain pine beetle, and the number of beetle-killed trees that would be available for bioenergy projects.  Failing to explain that this is not where the majority of the wood comes from seems unfair to the audience who rely on  to form opinions on forest issues and energy policies.  This would not help to promote a relationship of trust between the public and the news media (Kovach and Rosentiel 52-3).  The results of this study indicate that the The Vancouver Sun has framed bioenergy according to the messages of BC Hydro and the provincial government.  The elements that has selected to frame wood bioenergy are that it is carbon neutral and a l i     41  renewable energy source that can solve the mountain pine beetle epidemic.  As explained earlier this has the power to effect the public\\u2019s perception of this idea.  Bioenergy should be something the public understands correctly.  A commonly cited problem with the explanation of environmental issues or green products is that the information is confusing.  If bioenergy is pursued as a power source and the province becomes reliant on it to contribute energy to the grid, the public may feel duped when their preconceived notions of this industry are shown to be untrue. l i i    42  BC Ministry of Forests.

Vancouver, B.C.:Oct 18, 2006.  p. D8  (501  words)  PRINCE RUPERT -- A partnership between Canadian Forest Products, Pinnacle Pellet and the Moricetown First Nation will see wood pellets travel through Prince Rupert and overseas in order to lower greenhouse gas emissions in Japan. Leroy Reitsma, business development manager with Canfor, said the pellets that will be moving through Prince Rupert's Ridley Terminals in 2007 will be sent to Japan where they will be used in a coal displacement project. The coal-fired electrical generation facility in Japan is being converted to burn pellets. \\\"It's all about reducing the use of coal and meeting targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\\\" said Reitsma. The wood pellet plant is part of a larger project that includes the installation of a new bark-fired energy system at the Houston Canfor sawmill in the northern Interior. The combination of the wood pellet plant and the bark-fired energy system provides an economically viable, value-added alternative to beehive burners. Since 1968 when Canfor opened a sawmill in Houston, 16 million gigajoules of energy in the form of bark and sawdust have simply been expelled into the atmosphere -- a value of $300 million. \\\"When you look at that, there has to be a better way,\\\" he said. Reitsma went on to explain Canfor's sawmill in Houston produces three types of waste: bark removed from the outside of the logs; sawdust produced when logs are cut; and shavings left over from planing the logs to size after they have been dried. Previously, the debris was put into a beehive burner, but provincial regulations required Canfor to phase out the burner by 2007. In 2004, Canfor began working with Pinnacle Pellet to market pellets made from waste wood using heat and high pressure. That left the question of what to do with the bark. it's now burned at the sawmill and provides the heat required for both lumber and pellet production. The project is also an opportunity for Canfor to further their relationship with the Moricetown Band. They already do business with Kyahwood Forest Products -- a joint venture between the two parties that directly employs 75 people in Moricetown in lumber remanufacturing. l v i i   48  In addition to sending the pellets through a silo storage facility at Ridley Terminals and on to Japan, the partnership will also sell product into the U.S. \\\"We are working with Ridley Terminals to ship wood pellets and we are working with CN to use their Prairie train car fleet to back- haul to U.S. markets,\\\" said Reitsma Pellets are proving a popular alternative to the high cost of natural gas, said Reitsma. Before they had financing they were able to sell out the product for the first five years. \\\"We are currently producing pellets on budget and most important of all, all of our partners are on the same page.\\\" In addition, turning biomass into energy is part of a strategy to keep Canfor competitive in the current lumber market, he said \\\"Wood residue is an asset that must be used to improve our competitive position.\\\" l i x    49  Forest industry faces major changes; Much of B.C.'s wood supply will be used for bioenergy instead of pulp and lumber, expert says:[Final Edition] Gordon Hamilton. The Vancouver Sun.Vancouver, B.C.:May 11,2007.  p. H1 (714 words)  Natural Resources: The B.C. forest industry turned in one of the world's worst performances in 2006, but a transformation of historic proportions is just over the horizon, one of the province's leading industry consultants said Thursday. PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Craig Campbell said traditional pulp and lumber production, particularly in the pine beetle-ravaged Interior, is going to give way to bioenergy, smoothing over the boom- and-bust cycles that characterize the industry today. Campbell's forecast of a prosperous future comes at a time when the industry is the world's basket case. He said mountains of logs are piling up alongside forest roads today because companies cannot economically convert them to lumber. The industry tumbled from the world's top performing region two years ago, when it had $1.5 billion in profits, to the bottom of the heap in 2006, losing $500 million, according to findings released Thursday by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Further, return on capital employed -- a key indicator of financial health -- dropped to -1.8 per cent as the industry fought against the mountain pine beetle infestation, a depressed U.S. housing market and a soaring Canadian dollar, Campbell said at PWC's 20th Global Forest and Paper Industry Conference. Lumber prices are bumping along the bottom but he said he sees no sign that they are going to improve soon. Despite the bad performance, Campbell said huge changes are under way -- a consequence of the mountain pine beetle infestation -- that will transform the province's wood products industry from reliance on cyclical commodities to more stable energy production. \\\"The next five years in the B.C. forest industry are going to be without a doubt the biggest transformation we will ever see,\\\" Campbell told the 500 people attending the conference. The pine beetle is the greatest challenge and, as wood quality deteriorates in the dead pine stands, less of it will be suitable for lumber. \\\"The outlook is very bleak for the Interior sawmilling industry. Dozens of sawmills are going to close.\\\" He said that in the Interior, 15 million cubic metres of timber - - enough lumber to fill half a million logging trucks -- is going to waste in huge roadside piles because it cannot be economically converted to lumber. Other factors driving the change include:     50   Ownership of the industry is changing rapidly, with new investors buying stakes in B.C. companies.  Softwood duty refunds injected a $2.5-billion windfall that PWC did not include in its earnings report.  Carbon credits trading is coming, adding a new source of revenue. It all adds up to \\\"big opportunities for biomass energy using beetle wood,\\\" Campbell said. In a later interview, Campbell said the industry is buzzing over the potential of electrical generation. BC Hydro has committed to promoting bioenergy and the key question remaining is what kind of subsidy it will offer producers. \\\"We are getting phone calls to do studies for energy companies vis a vis the wood supply. There is a lot of momentum and interest. That's where I see we are going to shift: from traditional lumber to energy.\\\" He sounded a note of caution on subsidies, however, saying that in Europe subsidies to energy producers lead to higher wood prices, forcing some traditional wood-products manufacturers out of business. Mark Connelly, investment analyst with Credit Suisse, said diversifying into energy production looks like a smart move, but he questioned how ready B.C. companies are to diversify, noting many have not diversified out of the region, a basic financial strategy. \\\"One of the reasons B.C. wood companies have such a problem is that they are B.C. companies,\\\" he said. \\\"What you have here, in my mind, is an industry that locked itself into a region that now suddenly has a real problem,\\\" he said, referring to the beetle. \\\"Every time you read a money- management thing, it says diversify. And B.C. didn't.\\\" Both Campbell and Connelly noted that the face of the industry is changing as activist investors buy stakes. Campbell singled out B.C. billionaire Jim Pattison, Montreal's Stephen Jarislowsky and New York-based Third Avenue Management, which has a $800-million investment in B.C. companies. He said the industry needs to consolidate beyond what has taken place already. \\\"The question looms whether Third Avenue will role its pulp assets all under one banner,\\\" he said. i      51  New independent power could add $26.1 billion to B.C. economy: report Scott Simpson.  The Vancouver Sun.  Vancouver, B.C.:Nov 3, 2009.  p. C.7 (546 words)  The independent power sector could inject $26.1 billion into the British Columbia economy by 2020, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study to be released today in Vancouver.  The report, commissioned by the Independent Power Producers Association of B.C., says $26.1 billion in capital investment could generate $9 billion for economic growth over the next 11 years -- representing a 4.5-per-cent increase in the size of the provincial economy.  PwC is still polishing the report and expects to release an authoritative version before year's end.  A draft version is being presented today to IPPBC members at their annual conference. IPPs are now working through a BC Hydro call for power that seeks 6,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of new green energy from wind, run-of-river hydro, bioenergy and other renewable sources of electricity.  But the report says IPPs could deliver more than four times that amount -- 26,500 GWh -- to the grid by 2020. The numbers are not far-fetched -- Hydro's most recent call received bids totalling 17,000 GWh, and there are many projects around the province still in earlier stages of development.  Some of the electricity could be used to develop a substantial export industry -- producing 12,000 GWh per year to sell to green-power-eager markets in the United States. But the report also notes that electricity demand within B.C. could absorb all 26,500 gigawatt hours if new high-density office and residential buildings opt for electric heating instead of natural gas.  Total employment impacts from IPPs, at that level of development, would reach 87,000 person- years, and government revenues generated through the construction phase of potential IPP projects are estimated at $1.6 billion, the report says.  PwC says the Central Interior would realize the greatest benefit from biomass projects -- which require waste wood for fuel -- because it is the hub of B.C.'s forest industry.  The Lower Mainland-South Coast has the greatest potential for benefit from run of river development.  The Peace River region, meanwhile, would realize the greatest benefits from development of wind energy. \\\"From our perspective it's a good news story,\\\" PwC partner John Webster, who is presenting the report, said in an interview on Monday.  \\\"Essentially once you've got the market estimates of electricity demand and you have the capital expenditures that derive from that, you plug the numbers into a very conventional economic input-output model.\\\"  i i     52  The report should spur both the industry and the government to action -- and alert communities around B.C. to the economic opportunities on their doorsteps, said Harvie Campbell, IPPBC chairman.  \\\"The purpose of the report is more to get specific about what that opportunity is, and what the demands are going to be on the industry, the opportunity for the communities, etc.,\\\" Campbell said. \\\"We need to make sure we are working hand in hand with Victoria, with BC Hydro, with BCTC to bring about this big opportunity for the province.\\\"\"\n",

This paper also explores concepts such as hegemony in the news, media effects, and the changing media landscape.          iii Table of Contents  Abstract .................................................................................................................................... ii Table of Contents ................................................................................................................... iii List of Tables .......................................................................................................................... iv Acknowledgements ................................................................................................................. v Dedication ............................................................................................................................... vi 1    Chapter: Introduction ...................................................................................................... 1 1.1 Background: the G8-G20 .......................................................................................................... 4 2    Chapter: Literature Review ............................................................................................. 5 2.1 Protest, freedom and democracy ............................................................................................... 5 2.2 Frame theory ............................................................................................................................. 5 2.3 Stereotypes ................................................................................................................................ 8 2.4 Ideology, hegemony and the news ............................................................................................ 9 2.5 The global justice movement .................................................................................................. 11 2.6 Social movement theory ......................................................................................................... 12 2.7 The changing media landscape ............................................................................................... 13 3    Chapter: Research Data ................................................................................................. 16 3.1 Sources .................................................................................................................................... 16 3.2 Marginalization of protesters .................................................................................................. 19 3.3 Trivialization of protesters ...................................................................................................... 23 3.4 Dissenting frames ................................................................................................................... 26 4    Chapter: Discussion ........................................................................................................ 29 4.1 Findings .................................................................................................................................. 29 4.2 Hegemony ............................................................................................................................... 34 4.3 Media effects .......................................................................................................................... 35 4.4 The end of the information gatekeeper? ................................................................................. 36 5    Chapter: Final Thoughts ................................................................................................ 38 Bibliography .......................................................................................................................... 41 Appendix A: Summary of Findings ..................................................................................... 44     iv List of Tables    Table 3.1    Sources ................................................................................................................. 16 Table 3.2    Marginalization of protesters ............................................................................... 19 Table 3.3    Trivialization of protesters ................................................................................... 24 Table 3.4    Dissenting frames ................................................................................................ 26        v Acknowledgements  I offer my appreciation to the faculty, staff and my fellow students at the UBC School of Journalism who have enriched this scholarly jaunt. I owe particular thanks to my primary advisor, Prof. Joe Cutbirth, for taking a distinct interest in my success. He treated my research with the same earnestness that he would his own.  I thank Dr. Rima Wilkes for making space in her busy schedule to work with me on a directed study, without which this research would have been remarkably lacking. I thank her also for her patient feedback and gentle criticisms throughout the entire advisory process.  Special thanks are owed to my parents, whose unmitigated encouragement has made these many years of education possible and fruitful. They\\u2019ve taught me to chase the things in life that I want, rather than the things I ought.  I also thank Elyse Fortin for her perpetual patience, support and uncompromised confidence in me. Many thanks as well to Brynne Morrice, whose perspective on life is a driving force behind much of what I do.             vi Dedication  This thesis is dedicated to Zella Murray   1 1    Chapter: Introduction  In summer 2010, Huntsville and Toronto, Ontario hosted the G8-G20 summits. Between June 25 and 27, with the world\\u2019s political and economic leaders concealed behind a six-kilometer, $5 million fence, (Kirton M1) tens of thousands of social movement members1, individual protesters2 and onlookers converged on the streets of Toronto. Participants sought to use the G8-G20 as a forum to get national and international media coverage and to encourage a public conversation about a variety of Canadian and global social justice issues and Canada\\u2019s role and objectives within the international diplomatic community. The news frame that Canadians witnessed was not a conversation but instead a cacophony: burning police cars, broken windows and cops marching in riot gear. The Canadian audience saw, heard and read about confusing, turbulent clashes among social movements organizations, protesters, residents, police, onlookers and the media that covered the event -- which culminated in the arrest of more than 900 people -- Canada\\u2019s largest-ever mass arrest (Gray A1). Throughout the summit weekend, it became increasingly difficult for Canadians to differentiate between the crass and destructive minority (which absorbed the bulk of the media\\u2019s attention) and the reflexive, organized and communicative majority of protesters whose narrative got lost in the riot story.  1 The G8-G20 in June 2010 hosted a complex, fluid and intersectional array of individuals, organizations and networks with varying commitments, interests and objectives. For the sake of consistency and clarity in this study the term social movement organization (a well- discussed term in its own right among social movement scholars) will be used to characterize protest groups. Mario Diani (1992) provides a \\u201csynthetic definition\\u201d of social movements that is suitable for the purposes of this paper: \\u201cA social movement is a network of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in a political or cultural conflict, on the basis of a shared collective identity.\\u201d (13) 2 In instances where no discernable, relevant network or organizational structures applies, individual demonstrators will be called protesters.  2 This study takes a timely snap shot of how the Globe and Mail  -- Canada\\u2019s foremost national publication -- covered protest during the G8-G20 in Ontario. It looks at the Globe\\u2019s use of language and its construction of coverage regarding social movements and protesters. In other words, this paper explores the Globe\\u2019s protester frame. In the current journalistic environment -- which is clearly in technological, social, and economic transformation -- it\\u2019s important to pause and assess how the Globe situates itself within large-scale, public disruption to local, national and global order. The Globe was selected because it is Canada\\u2019s largest national daily paper of record (second to only the Toronto Star, a paper with a larger circulation, but one that is primarily regional). Another motivating factor in selecting the Globe is its identity and marketability as an elite publication, and one that can legitimate public discourse3. With the Globe as my source, I searched Factiva for all articles including: \\u201cG8 or G20 and Protests or Protesters.\\u201d I cross-referenced those findings (47 articles) with the Globe\\u2019s G8-G20 summit hub website which provided an additional 15 articles for a total sample of 62 articles including news stories, editorials, columns, features, profiles, and analysis. My sample includes articles from June 24, 2010 to July 1, 2010. The date parameters were selected to catch anticipatory stories filed on the two days before the summit, plus two days during the summit to collect breaking news reports, and four days of follow-up, analysis and editorial coverage throughout the following week. I looked for:  3 According to Media-Corps, the Globe and Mail\\u2019s international advertising representative, the Globe reaches more Canadians with: University educations, household incomes of more than $125,000, personal incomes of more than $100,000, senior management positions, and more professional positions than any other Canadian newspaper. http://media- corps.com/Media-Corps_print_globeandmail.html  3 1.) SOURCES: instances of primary reliance on attributed official sources such as politicians, business leaders, police leadership, or spokespeople (Gitlin 1980; Paletz, Entman 1981; Schudson 2003; Gans 2003); 2.) MARGINALIZATION OF PROTESTORS: descriptions, language and primary/dominant frames that emphasized violence and civic disruption (Gitlin 1980; Ashley, Olson 1998; Gans 2003; Boyle et al 2005; Boykoff 2006); 3.) TRIVILIZATION OF PROTESTORS: coverage that showed disparagement by numbers, disparagement on the basis of identity, undermining tone, frivolous quotation marks (Gitlin 1980; Lee, Craig 2002; Ashley, Olson 1998); and 4.) DISSENTING FRAMES: that introduced first person accounts of the protests by social movement activists, or primary frames that contested official or hostile narratives about the protests or protesters. I tallied those findings and then pulled relevant examples into my overall analysis of the coverage while acknowledging fundamental scholarship on media framing and social movement theory. Research question: As Canada\\u2019s national paper of record, how did the Globe and Mail explore themes and messages brought forth by SMOs, and protesters during the G8-G20? Hypothesis: The Globe, throughout the G8-G20 adhered to a dominant discourse in favour of the status quo. The Globe\\u2019s social, economic and cultural identity conforms to a particular hegemonic ideology -- pro-business, pro-civic stability and pro-status quo -- and the newspaper as an institution found itself at odds with protesters and their messaging resulting in a coverage of protest that emphasized violence and disruption to political, social and economic order.  4 1.1 Background: The G8-G20  Rambouillet, France played host to the first G7 in 19754. Participants included France, Germany, the UK, the US, Japan and Italy. Canada was added for the 1976 summit in Puerto Rico, and representatives from the European Community attended in 1977. The annual meeting between the world\\u2019s largest industrial economies was arranged to discuss issues including macroeconomics, international trade, development, east-west relations, terrorism, human rights, arms control, and energy resources. Russia first attended in 1994 and rounded out the G8 as a full member in 1998 at the summit in Birmingham. After economic and financial crisis in the late 1990s, finance ministers from the G8 suggested that a secondary informal meeting be held among the G8\\u2019s finance ministers, central bank managers, and representatives from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the suggestion of then-Canadian finance minister Paul Martin, the meetings were expanded to include representatives from emerging economies as a way to comprehensively deliberate and discuss global economic issues. The G20 was first held informally in 1999, and consisted of the G8, plus the European Union and was joined by Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, China, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Australia. In 2008, George W. Bush invited the G20 heads of state to Washington DC for an official summit. The joint G8-G20 in Toronto and Huntsville marked the fourth episode, and it\\u2019s been decided that the G20 will continue to meet annually, each fall. France will host in 2011, followed by a summit in Mexico in 20125.   4 Information on G8 origins from University of Toronto\\u2019s G8 Information Centre: http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/what_is_g8.html 5 Information on G20 origins from University of Toronto\\u2019s G20 Information Centre: http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/g20whatisit.html  5 2    Chapter: Literature Review  2.1 Protest, freedom and democracy  Healthy, enduring, democratic communities rely on active exchanges of ideas, opinions and information (Dewey 1922; Freire 2005). In the Canadian context the Globe and Mail has the privilege of facilitating those exchanges. We must look at an institution like the Globe and ask whether it\\u2019s providing Canadians with information that is needed to exercise freedom, hold leaders to account and nourish democracy. Our system of governance is constructed with democratic institutions but that framework is only a mechanism to secure the idea of democracy. Active -- even turbulent -- communication has to be the primary ingredient in the recipe for great, sustainable, democratic communities. Knowledge and wisdom cannot be created in a vacuum and grows best out of active interaction and exchange (Dewey 144). The press remains the prime facilitator. Without criticism and without holding truth to power -- one of the fourth estate\\u2019s ideal objectives -- freedom is fleeting. Individuals, communities, societies, and countries must reject the \\u201cfear of freedom,\\u201d and seek humanization through accountability and responsibility (Freire 2005). \\u201cLiberation is\\u2026a childbirth, and a painful one (51). Freedom, as we enjoy it in Canada, requires reflection, solidarity, dialogue and vocal, visible action. The best venue for this action is our public spaces -- our streets. Toronto, during the G8-G20, presented an opportunity for comprehensive and far-ranging public dialogue pertaining to an array of social justice disorders at home and abroad. 2.2 Frame theory  The central focus in this study is how news gets framed (Tuchman 1978; Gitlin 1980; Ashley, Olson 1998; Entman 2003; Gans 2003). When journalists report a story there is a  6 series of decisions that must get made while reporting in the field and while crafting the news story back in the newsroom. What is the tone? Who gets a voice? What is the purpose? What gets emphasized? De-emphasized? What\\u2019s the angle? The sum of all of those parts is the story\\u2019s frame (Tuchman 5). Who gets a voice in the story is one of the most important aspects of the news frame. When political or business leaders have something to say, the press usually listens attentively and reports it (Gans 52). Official or authoritative sources have the opportunity to set the news frame and to even influence what language gets used to tell a story (Entman 2003). Official press conferences, typically closed to the public, are the primary intersection for reporters and leaders (415). It\\u2019s at these contained, arranged and structured events that most public policy narratives originate. When the media relies on information and language provided by officials and leaders, news organizations participate in cultural strumming (Entman 2003). By \\u201cstrumming\\u201d officials\\u2019 talking points, the media can reproduce news frames posited from the top-down. This \\u201ccascading activation\\u201d sets in motion a cultural logic that permeates communities and spreads through popular discourse (418). Like a waterfall, discourse flows down to lower levels from higher ones. The water (discourse) mixes with other perspectives and then over time eventually finds its way back to the origins of the system creating a dominant frame. It is possible that the result is hegemonic social and cultural congruence, a level of acceptability for any given subject or news story. Another ingredient in a news frame is the overall treatment of voices, characters and participants. The way that protesters during the G8-G20 were framed reminds of experiences by other challenges to the status quo. Studies of media framing have found de-legitimization  7 of protester messaging by using undermining quotation marks (Ashley, Olson 1998). Media coverage of protest movements or protest events has also been found to trivialize protesters on the basis of appearance and dress (Gitlin 1980; Ashley, Olson 1998). Furthermore, newspaper coverage has been shown to emphasize internal dissension and undercount participants while contrasting protesters against other favoured counter- movements more congruent with the media outlet\\u2019s economic, political and cultural sensibilities (Ashley, Olson 266, 268, 269; Gitlin 27; Lee, Craig 1992). It\\u2019s important then to consider whether the Globe afforded G8-G20 protesters a straight face while covering social justice action for the Canadian public. As much as a news frame is a sum of many parts (voices, words, tone) it\\u2019s also a lens through which the world is viewed. Like a window frame, a news frame\\u2019s quality depends on many variables (Tuchman 1978). Variables like size, vantage point, clarity, shape, can either reveal or blur a vision of the outside landscape (1). Part of understanding where those elements come from is recognizing that news is \\u201cfirst and foremost a social institution\\u201d (Tuchman 1978; Chomsky 1997; Gans 2003). The media\\u2019s institutional construct depends a variety of different political and economic entities (corporate parent companies, advertisers and government) and they can impact how information gets framed. If one of these sections, or individuals within them, want to float an idea or a perspective through the media, they can. Ordinary citizens are rarely provided an opportunity to express their interests, feelings and impressions (Tuchman, 4). The structure of the newsroom also plays a role in how dominant frames get established. News is increasingly a mass production built within an environment similar to that of a factory (Gans 49). In recent years the urgency within news production has  8 intensified. News organizations continue to produce daily iterations of the paper, but they must also update the web regularly while posting to various social media outlets. This perpetual news grind and continuous cycle limits a reporter\\u2019s ability to comprehensively gather news. One of the side effects is that reporters increasingly rely on official sources and oversimplify narratives in order to keep the news flowing while holding the reader\\u2019s precarious attention (Gans 49, 52, 61). The factory-esque construction of news may diminish the opportunity for covering stories about social movements and protest in a way that teases out complexity, reflexivity and nuance. Urgency begets simplicity and the simplest stories at the G8-G20 were burning cars, broken windows and violence on the streets. When assessing the protester frame wrought by the Globe and Mail I drew from Gitlin\\u2019s seminal frame analysis (1980). He found that CBS and the New York Times: 1) trivialized protesters (by making light of language, dress, age, style and goals, and by disparaging on the basis of numbers and effectiveness). 2) Marginalized protesters (by portraying demonstrators as deviant or unrepresentative, and by amplifying violence and communist imagery); and 3) relied disproportionately on official sources (government officials, police etc) to set the frame of the news story and to interpret the issues for the public (27). 2.3 Stereotypes  Stereotypes are a quick and easy way to establish a news frame. When building narratives and telling stories the media (and most individuals) resort to stereotypical or symbolic portrayals (Lippmann 1922; Gitlin 1980). People often communicate based on the images in their heads, rather than through substantive criticism, observations and engagement (Lippmann 77). When a reporter or publication is packaging a story, limited time and space  9 forces boiled-down versions of comments, events and observations resulting in easily digested baseline narratives (Gitlin 230). One of the elements of news frames that this study considers when assessing the Globe and Mail\\u2019s coverage is its use of intellectual shorthand. How did the paper portray, describe and characterize protesters? 2.4 Ideology, hegemony and the news  The way we talk (or write) about things is the one of the drivers of ideology and hegemony (Lee, Craig 1992). Media frames enacted upon protesters can draw them either within the margins of public discourse or can push them to the fringes. The way that a protest event, a protest organization or a social movement gets framed can have lasting consequences on how those entities operate and deliver their messaging to the public (Gitlin, 1980). In the 1960s, hostile coverage of the Students for Democratic Society -- a multi-issue social movement organization that led the resistance to the Vietnam War -- pushed the organization to social and political margins. The corporate media (the New York Times and CBS, in this case) were unable and/or unwilling to disrupt the hegemonic discourse constructed and maintained by U.S. political, economic and social elite -- of which those two organizations were a part. A convergence of factors including newsgathering routines (reliance on official sources), framing tendencies, and the inability of the SDS to handle increased attention and membership growth caused tensions within the organization regarding how to engage the public and express their mandate. Within a couple of years of first finding the spotlight, the SDS found itself increasingly radicalized and on the fringes of the public conversation about U.S. foreign policy, the war, and participatory democracy.  10 It\\u2019s important to consider sociological studies of framing while acknowledging political and social power as a driving force for elite hegemonic discourse (Carragee, Roefs, 2006). Too often scholars wield notions of framing without thinking about the causes of those frames, relying heavily on assessments of the effects of media filters and outputs (216). To think about how the media situates itself within social, political and economic power it\\u2019s worthwhile to draw scholars such as Tuchman (1978), Gitlin (1980), Gamson (1992), and Entman (1993) back into the fold of framing research because those scholars thought of framing as a fluid, reciprocal, and intersecting process. The media is not an insular thing. It\\u2019s made up of individuals who are just as vulnerable to cultural, social and political influences as anybody else, and those individuals are making decisions in the newsroom. To understand how any media organization works, it\\u2019s important to understand its institutions (Chomsky 1997). Whether it\\u2019s CBS, the New York Times, (or the Globe and Mail) -- those organizations\\u2019 institutional structures lend themselves to upholding the political, economic and social status quo to the detriment of social change (3). Mostly, media organizations like the Globe are large, profitable, corporate entities, and many are linked to corporate conglomerates outside of the media industry. These institutions are by nature tyrannical -- if there is dissention in the lower levels of the structure, the only option for the dissenter is to exit the organization (2). The Globe like other elite, media companies relies on readers who are typically affluent and politically, economically or socially mobilized. Business leaders, University experts, government spokespeople, and other media elites also typify the sorts of voices found in the paper. Reliance on those sorts of readers and sources foster echo chambers that construct adherence and conformity (4). When it comes to reporting, it\\u2019s not that journalists are  11 prevented from doing their job properly or independently, it\\u2019s that organizations resist individuals with divisive perspectives and they weed out individuals who refuse to conform to the approved status quo (4). The outcome of institutional perpetuity and congruence is that major players in the media can actually preserve the legitimacy of political, economic and social systems (Paletz, Entman 1981). By failing to access alternative voices outside the institutional and structural power brokers, the media decrease the ability of ordinary citizens to exercise their own power, their own voices (6). 2.5 The global justice movement  What took place during the G8-G20 was clearly more complex and diverse than one group or a single SMO reacting and protesting to a single social justice issue. Much like what happened during the WTO meetings in Seattle in 19996, the protests in Toronto had the flavour of a global justice movement (Boykoff 2006). Many different antagonistic frames were put forth by the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, ABC, CBS, FOX, CNN, and NBC during the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle (Boykoff 2006). Five different framing filters emerged from the media coverage of the Seattle protesters: the violence frame, the disruption frame, the freak frame, the ignorance frame and the amalgam of grievances frame7. That framework of framing provides a good point of reference when assessing how  6 Jules Boykoff (2006) found it worthwhile to consolidate the plethora of social justice concerns and activists during the media\\u2019s portrayal of Seattle\\u2019s \\u201cjamboree of teamsters, and turtle protectors\\u201d and \\u201castonishing array of causes, costumes and voices\\u201d into the notion of the global justice movement. 7 Boykoff\\u2019s framework combined with Gitlin\\u2019s provided my study with the criteria to judge how the Globe and Mail framed protesters in Toronto. \\t\\r \\u00a0  12 the Globe framed its coverage of protests under similar circumstances more than a decade later in Toronto. 2.6 Social movement theory  Studying how the media handles social movements and activism requires an understanding of what social movements actually are. A framework of protest helps us look at the diverse protest agenda at the G8-G20 and problematizes monolithic characterizations and generalizations of protesters by the media. Social movements can be understood by carving out four major themes or features. They are: 1.) collective behaviour: loose in organizational structure yet collective in a common pursuit to create change or resist; 2.) resource mobilization: a set of beliefs or activities united in a way to disrupt the reward/distribution system in a given society; 3.) political process: a social movement or organization attuned to seizing political agency; and 4.) new social movements: mobilizations that articulate the structural impediments to healthy communities and societies (Diani 2000). Understanding thematic characteristics of social movements can be complimented by exploring how individuals go from believing in something -- a cause, a movement -- to acting on behalf of those beliefs (Klandermans 1997). A movement must establish a collective action frame that includes common concerns, a sense of injustice, and action-oriented beliefs. In a study of Dutch anti-nuclear protesters, it was found that for a movement to successfully mobilize, it had to recruit through networking, articulate a target, sustain interest, and remove obstacles (Klandermans 22). Of course, mobilizing a network or group  13 of activists is more complicated than that. The disincentives to protest can be powerful. A disapproving family, or concerns over lost wages (if the movement plans a strike), or the threat of arrest can reduce willingness to participate. Another challenge in mobilizing a network is how the media portrays protesters and members. Thinking about protesters and social movement organizations in terms of motivations, strategies and anticipated outcomes can help eliminate protester essentialism and stereotypes. Often, the relationship between media and protesters seems to be a \\u201cdialogue of the deaf\\u201d (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 1993). Social movements traditionally rely on the press to disseminate their message while the reporter or news organization looks to protesters and movements to make news (115). Social movements need the mainstream media in order to gain recruits, achieve validation and increase the scope of the movement (116). In exchange, the reporters expect drama. It\\u2019s not a balanced reciprocity and social movements typically rely more on the mainstream media than vice versa. When the media does engage social movements or protest networks reporters find them complex and confusing (115). 2.7 The changing media landscape  Much of the literature since Gitlin (1980) has assessed the balance of power between social movements, protesters and the media. The power of the news media in recent years may be waning (Cottle 2008; Shirky 2008; Goldstein 2007; Castells 2007). SMOs and individual protesters or onlookers now have the ability to interact directly with the public via smart phones, and with blogs, Facebook, podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, bypassing traditional, commercial gatekeepers (Cottle 858). New opportunities within the realm of social movements and protest are arising for communication, story telling, mobilization and public interaction.  14 The Internet combined with new mobile devices and growing dissatisfaction with media gatekeepers can result in the public taking the responsibility for disseminating information into their own hands. Take, for instance, the case of the 2004 Ukrainian Orange Revolution (Goldstein 2007). During a presidential election citizens were growing frustrated with electoral fraud and with the Ukrainian media that were failing to provide critical and balanced election coverage due to government restrictions and censorship (2). Electoral activists turned to the Internet en masse as a way to bypass government restrictions on the press. Mobilized via social networking, personal websites and digital forums, protesters camped out in tent cities across the country throughout the election calling for electoral transparency and accountability. The true value of online communication in Ukraine came to light when Viktor Yanukovych (the 2004 presidential hopeful who was handpicked by the previous president) was attending a rally. As he passed onlookers in the street, a protester flung an egg that burst against Yanukovych\\u2019s chest. Feigning injury he retreated and his campaign team quickly announced via the press that he was hit and wounded by an attacker who threw a battery. Digital footage taken by a person attending the rally was soon uploaded onto the web. It proved otherwise. Presidential messaging was corrected not by the media, but by onlookers that captured the unfiltered truth8 (6). Protesters and onlookers in Toronto were able to cover the G8-G20 in a similar manner. The service that the Globe and Mail provides is a becoming less expensive, and more accessible to non-professionals (Shirky 2008). The Internet provides unlimited space for news, punditry, videos, images, forums, social networks and other publishing and  8 It\\u2019s worth noting that Yanukovych ended up losing the 2004 election, but eventually ascended to the presidency in 2010.  15 mobilization tools. The question of \\u201cwhy publish this?\\u201d has shifted to \\u201cwhy not publish this?\\u201d (60) We\\u2019re living in a networked society, and one that is arranged by mass self- communication (Castells 2007).  Before this information revolution, stories that didn\\u2019t make to, or through the media, didn\\u2019t make it to the public. The media gatekeepers may be losing their mandate. If a flung battery turns out to be an egg or if a Toronto police officer is badge- less and beating people indiscriminately, the public will see it regardless of whether an editor decides they ought to.   16 3    Chapter: Research Data  The study examines 62 Globe articles; 33 can be arranged as news stories, 14 as opinion/columns, 3 as Globe editorials, and 12 articles fell into a fourth general category in which I included features, analysis, profiles, and \\u201cQ and A-style\\u201d interviews9. 3.1 Sources  Of the 62 articles, nearly a third were framed by use of various official or authoritative sources including police leadership, members of the Integrated Security Unit, government officials, or members of business improvement associations and local business owners. In other words, the main thrust of the story was shaped or directed by the impressions, comments and opinions by authoritative stakeholders with a specific set of interests. Table 3.1 Official, authoritative, business perspective as primary source/total number of articles Percentage of articles with official/authoritative/business voice as primary source 20/62 32%  A story by Adrian Morrow published on June 27, the final day of summit, reported on the easing of security precautions by the Integrated Security Unit as the end of the summit approached, but cautioned that police forces retained the ability to extend their mandate into the following week if necessary. The first attributed quote went to Sergeant Tim Burrows, a  9Writing and Reporting the News (2008), a journalism instructional text, explains that news content usually includes facts, attribution, quotations, background and context, supplemented with accurate observations. Features would also include many or all of the above qualities but would also provide the writer more flexibility to exercise tone, colour, analysis and interpretation. Columns or editorials are opinions, prescriptions and impressions that are expressed by individual writers or the news organization\\u2019s editorial board. Taken together all portions of the newspaper contributes to overall discourse on a given subject.  17 spokesman for the ISU:  \\u201cOur security plan runs from the 18th to the 28th, so [the plan] will remain in place until midnight Monday evening,\\u2026\\u201cIf [police are] required to stay longer, we\\u2019ll make that decision then.\\u201d Morrow continued in paraphrase: \\u201cHe [Sergeant Burrows] said officers would remain on duty around the security perimeter, but if the situation was peaceful enough, they might start letting people into the secure perimeter early.\\u201d Morrow then provided Toronto City Councillor, Adam Vaughan, an opportunity to respond. \\u201cI think we\\u2019ll see the anxiety leave as the G20 does\\u2026my understanding is that some of the barricades are coming down tonight.\\u201d Morrow went on to report that by Sunday afternoon Mr. Vaughan was able to pass into the security zone \\u201cvia Queens Quay without being stopped by police.\\u201d In next graph Morrow touched on the councillor\\u2019s hope that the city would return to normal during the following week. Morrow then turned to Janice Solomon, the director of the Entertainment District Business Improvement Area. Paraphrasing Solomon, Morrow wrote that local businesses would likely keep their own security precautions in place through Monday as they assessed whether it was safe to return to business as usual. Most editors expect to see tension in news reporting. It\\u2019s clear that Solomon\\u2019s contribution to the story is to assess the loss of business due to the G8-G20, but her assessment of blame is ambiguous, but seems to assign fault to the protesters. Now we have to wait out tonight and wait out tomorrow and see what happens, she [Ms. Solomon] said Sunday evening. Businesses shuttered during the protests would likely try to re-open Monday. Ms. Solomon said none of the businesses in her area were vandalized by protesters, but they lost enormous amounts of business. On Saturday, the most violent day of protests, she said only a handful of restaurants and clubs remained open to serve the few patrons in the area. (web)   18 No voices from residents, protesters, or accused vandals were included. This story about an expanded police mandate could be framed in many different ways. It could explore obstructed mobility for residents by police, or concerns by protesters that their rights to freely assemble and demonstrate could be curtailed into the following week due to a handful of vandals. In this instance the Globe allowed a police officer, a politician and a business advocate to shape the story according to their own particular interests and mandates. It follows then that the story\\u2019s news element is business-centric and appeals to the pre-protest status quo. A second example by Globe reporter Siri Agrell illustrates a similar disruption to business frame posited by official sources. This story (published on June 28) begins with a local resident expressing shock over the level of vandalism and violence from throughout the summit weekend. Agrell then turns to Laura Schaefer of the Queen Street West Business Improvement Area. \\u201cI think as a country, Canada's so lucky to be a democracy and support peaceful protest. What we saw on Queen Street West yesterday was absolutely not peaceful...To see this destruction is beyond unfortunate.\\u201d At this point it would be useful to explore the notion of democratic rights and to hear from one of the many protesters who were on site exercising their freedom of speech in a \\u201cpeaceful\\u201d manner. Agrell solely includes voices that construct a singular frame that emphasizes disruption, while also touching on the lack of effectiveness of the unnamed, monolithic protesters-as-vandals. Agrell continues: At least eight stores sustained damage during Saturday's vandalism, and had begun filing insurance claims. The iconic Steve's Music marquee was melted from the heat of a police car that had been torched in front of the store. But with protests still underway in other locations around the city, the singed outline of burnt police vehicles was the only residue of events on Queen Street. Ms. Schaefer said city cleaning crews had quickly picked up broken glass and garbage. (A10)  19 After including a short quote from Councillor Adam Vaughan, Agrell includes comments by another member of the Downtown Business Improvement Association who said that about 40 member-businesses had damaged windows, but it was too early too say how much the cost of repairs would be. The voices or sources within a story often set the parameters and initiate the context. The next two elements: marginalization of protesters and trivialization of protesters take a look specifically at the content and tone of the Globe\\u2019s frames. 3.2 Marginalization of protesters  Of the total 62 articles, 27 (43.5 per cent) were framed in ways that marginalized protesters, primarily through emphasizing violence and civic disruption10. Table 3.2 Marginalizing frames/total articles Percentage of marginalizing frames 27/62 43.5%  Some, like this July 1 column by Christie Blatchford, provided Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair the opportunity to frame protesters collectively as deviant, immoral and disruptive11. The event took place during the repatriation of Canadian soldier Sergeant Jimmy MacNeil (his body was being delivered to the coroner\\u2019s office upon its return to Canada from Afghanistan on July 1, at the same time that protesters had gathered at a nearby location to protest police actions during the summit.) Blatchford writes:  10 To discern if the Globe was marginalizing protesters I drew from Gitlin (1980) and Boykoff (2006). Taken together their studies provide criteria to judge whether media frames are marginalizing protesters and social movement organizations. Thus my test for marginalization considers emphasis of violence, disruption to civic order, and vandalism. 11 This example also illustrates how single sourcing of an authoritative voice can posit a presumptive, unchallenged frame.  20 At the time the cort\\u00e8ge carrying Sgt. MacNeil's body was arriving at the coroner's office on Grosvenor Street, just two short blocks north of College Street, a group of about 30 demonstrators dressed in black moved out of a crowd of 2,000 who had massed in front of police headquarters on College. \\u201cThe Black Bloc was here and they charged up the thing [laneway], as a matter of fact the repatriation was kind of interrupted,\\u201d Chief Blair said. (A10)  Without reporting on whether or not these protesters were in fact, Black Bloc, what that meant, whether they were aware of the repatriation proceedings, Blatchford permits Chief Blair to define the intentions of the protesters, and to frame their activities as morally reprehensible and disruptive. Curiously, the column was not about protesters, nor the repatriation. It was actually an assessment of a controversial law that sought to give police the power to search or apprehend people who breached a five-meter buffer around the security fence. The column continues: The Black Bloc group, he [Chief Blair] said, was \\u201cclearly evident in the centre\\u201d of that protest. \\u201cI'm looking down on it, my people are taking pictures of this thing. You can very clearly see the formation of this Black Bloc group in the centre.\\u201d (A10)  Blatchford continues: The backlash against the way police conducted themselves has been bizarre, with critics first accusing them of being too lenient, then too harsh, then of abusing their authority in arresting or detaining hundreds. Spectacular claims have emerged, among them lesbians alleging that they were segregated in the temporary detention centre and a female filmmaker from Montreal who says she was threatened with \\u201cgang rape\\u201d there. (A10)  Blatchford eventually gets Chief Blair to acknowledge concerns regarding the fence regulation, but Blatchford\\u2019s dominant frame portrays a busy head-cop struggling against an immoral, reckless and \\u201cbizarre\\u201d angry mob. Chief Blair is provided a platform to justify particular police actions -- security and order at any cost. In a departure from a typical news story, a \\u201cQ and A\\u201d between the Globe\\u2019s Kelly  21 Grant, and Chief Blair, ran on June 29. The primary frame of the conversation was assessing why the police couldn\\u2019t do more to prevent protester violence and destruction. Chief Blair\\u2019s statements adhere to this frame, and also carved a second frame -- one that equates protest and public assembly to criminal behaviour. We were trying to strike a balance, as we have to in law, between the lawful rights of citizens to protest \\u2026 now unfortunately they [protesters using the Black Bloc tactic] turned their criminal intent away from the summit and they turned it on the people of Toronto. They rampaged on Queen and up Yonge\\u2026. It took time to get the resources up there. We're looking very hard at ways in which we can respond to those types of tactics. (A1)  The conversation then turns to a scene that occurred at the intersection of Queen and Spadina. Grant asks Chief Blair how it came about that police contained so many people, and for so long. Chief Blair responds by seemingly arguing that once turbulence erupted among a select group of vandals, everyone on the street thereby forfeited their right to be present. Chief Blair continues: The police gave three very clear warnings, separated by time, asking people to disperse, asking people to leave the area, warning those curious to leave the area to allow us to deal effectively with those who had come to commit criminal acts. They declined. Some left, some didn't. So we had to contain that. (A1)  Chief Blair continues, neglecting (and is not asked) to qualify how it was determined who was acting criminally or how it was illegal (\\u201ca breach of peace\\u201d) for people to gather in a public place regardless of whether they were \\u201cBlack Bloc\\u201d: This was not a site where somebody casually walked up to catch a bus. It was clearly a large and dangerous demonstration. It was clearly a situation that we were asking people to avoid. We were asking people to disperse. They ignored that request. When they were warned that if they remained in the area they would be subject to the breach of the peace, I suppose for some of them their curiosity -- or perhaps their profession -- compelled them to stay. (A1)   22 Chief Blair reiterates the criminality frame: There's no sanctuary from criminality. And what happened is after they rampaged along Queen and up Yonge Street, we watched them. We watched them as they went over to Queen's Park. We watched them as they changed into other clothes, and we watched them as they hid in the crowd among the people that had gathered at Queen's Park. We went in to apprehend them. (A1)  The excerpt is not included to question whether there were instances of criminality -- there certainly could have been. The point is to show how a frame can posit a singular impression. This particular one -- established by Toronto\\u2019s chief of police -- equates large-scale public assembly to criminality. The frame persists without a contestation of the premise that simply being present on the streets of Toronto is a breach of peace. Furthermore it treats protesters as a violent monolith, shedding no light on motivations or messages of other peaceful protesters present. At the heart of the issue of marginalizing coverage is the concept of intellectual shorthand and stereotyping (Lippmann 1922). In the top story from the Globe\\u2019s G8-G20 web hub titled \\u201cStandoff ends in downtown Toronto,\\u201d (reported by a team of four Globe journalists and sourced almost exclusively by members of the Integrated Security Unit) a group of detained protesters are described as: Looking \\u201colder than typical students, seated on the ground outside a U of T residence, with clear plastic bags of evidence or belongings around them. One man had a bushy grey beard. Others appeared to be university-aged women. Another arrested man, with a shaved head and green flipflops, sat on the sidewalk in handcuffs as police milled about. The suspects were being loaded on a bus, to be taken to the detention centre at Eastern Avenue.12 (Morrow et al web)  The descriptions continue:  12 My emphasis.  23 One bearded young man, being led to the bus in handcuffs, shouted: \\\"I'm innocent! I'm innocent!\\\" Another young man in a t-shirt and jeans appeared distraught and near tears as he was loaded into the bus. Most appeared to speak French as a first language, and police confirmed some were from Montreal. They said they might have been staying in U of T dorms for the summer. (web)  The descriptions that reporters use convey particular meaning to the reader. What does describing a person as \\u201ca bearded young man\\u201d symbolize? What does emphasizing the use of French imply? The use of protester essentialism can act as a \\u201cbackdoor\\u201d way to construct a frame that places protesters firmly outside of the margins of normative public opinion (Gitlin 118). Nearly half of the articles in the Globe sample included references or frames that emphasized violence13, deviance and civic disruption. Many articles also relied on intellectual shorthand and stereotypes to construct meaning surrounding un-sourced protesters. In essence, the prominent narrative during the G8-G20 became a riot story, blocking a more comprehensive conversation about social justice and the expectations by citizens of their political leaders and diplomats. 3.3 Trivialization of protesters  About one-fifth of all the articles framed protesters in a way that made light of their activities, disparaged their effectiveness or focused on their appearance or dress in a condescending tone14 (Gitlin 1980; Boykoff 2006).  13 Civic disruption and vandalism in many cases were conflated with violence. This particular point, though not dealt with directly in this study, should provoke another separate discussion on how the media frames its discourse around protest and could ask the questions: when/why/does breaking a window constitute(s) an act of violence? 14 As with marginalizing frames, work by Gitlin (1980) and Boykoff (2006) provide the criteria by which articles were found to trivialize protesters or not.  24 Table 3.3  Trivializing frames/total articles Percentage of trivializing frames 13/62 20.9%  This June 29 column by Marcus Gee establishes a disruption frame, but then trivializes un-sourced protesters on the basis of their inability to fulfill their apparent objectives. Yes, a small band of so-called anarchists went on a brief rampage through the downtown, producing shocking scenes of mayhem. But the world did not come to an end. No one went to hospital, thank goodness. Broken windows were the worst of the property damage. When it was all over, the city picked itself up, dusted itself off and went on with its business. Sorry, Black Bloc, but we survived, disgusted by your scripted display of adolescent outrage but just fine in the end, thanks. (A14)  The following June 28 column by John Doyle is another example of trivialization based on protester descriptions and ineffectiveness. Interestingly, Doyle (an arts and culture columnist) casts two stones, one at protesters, but another at the mainstream media, which he aptly suggests is foolishly preoccupied with the spectacle of violence. Without even seeing the footage we could all picture it -- kids in black hoodies and bandanas throwing stones, breaking windows and, probably, setting a police car on fire. That's precisely what it was, of course. See, the G20 is the Oscars of the protest-world. Tons of media attention, not much context. Photo-ops and fame. And television coverage of the G20 Summit and the protests in Toronto has been drearily predictable, and mostly as mindless as Oscars coverage. The protests -- representing nothing more than infantile, pay-attention-to-me-Mommy exhibitionism and destruction -- are photo- opportunities as much as the politicians' statements and handshakes, are photo-ops. Getting on television is pretty much the point of everything, and television loves live, violent action as it loves movie stars. (R1)  Doyle\\u2019s frustration with the media\\u2019s failure to provide thematic context is a noteworthy grievance. Despite his own concerns though he fails to disrupt his own marginalizing and trivializing frames: violence, disruption and disparagement of effectiveness, supplemented  25 with condescending tone. He also takes it one step further by suggesting a singular intention of protesters that \\u201cgetting on television is pretty much the point of everything.\\u201d Another column by Marcus Gee, this one on June 25, reflects one of Boykoff\\u2019s (2006) primary findings during his study of commercial media coverage and framing of the anti- WTO protests in Seattle in 1999. In that study Boykoff found: Negative portrayals of movement diversity were seven times more common than positive representations. For instance\\u2026USA Today reported, \\u201cA bewildering spectrum of voices has converged on Seattle\\u201d in order to give trade \\u201ca black eye.\\u201d The authors later asserted, \\u201cAnti-WTO forces are united by a profound mistrust of globalization -- and almost nothing else. (220)  Boykoff\\u2019s \\u201camalgam of grievances\\u201d frame was well represented in the Globe\\u2019s coverage, and most sharply in this instance when Marcus Gee disparages protesters for complaining about too many things at once. Protests at international gatherings tend to be eclectic events -- many groups, many causes -- but Toronto\\u2019s G20 protests may set some kind of record for the variety of complaints being voiced at one time. Even before the weekend summit gets under way, we have seen marches and demonstrations for gender justice, queer rights and disability rights; environmental and climate justice; and indigenous sovereignty. Monday\\u2019s day of protest was a mouthful, calling for \\u201cmigrant justice and an end to war and occupation, income equity and community control over resources.\\u201d (web)  Gee continues with the trivializing frame and then draws in stereotypical portrayals of the voiceless protesters: Two young guys with long hair and marijuana-leaf kerchiefs wore T-shirts advertising Oshawa Cannabis Day. On the less festive side, a group of about a dozen men and women wore ninja black from head to toe, with hoods and masks to keep their identities private. Their shouted message was simple enough: \\u201cFuck law and order.\\u201d It was all very colourful, but you have to wonder: with so many messages, does any one of them really stick? (web)   26 Despite his disparaging, condescending tone and his decision to emphasize marijuana activists as representative of the collective body of protesters and social movements, Gee asks a relevant question -- albeit one that remains unanswered -- do any of the issues really stick? 3.4 Dissenting frames  When looking at the Globe\\u2019s total coverage (62 articles) it\\u2019s clear that not all Globe coverage adhered to official frames that marginalized and/or trivialized protesters. In 15 per cent of the sample coverage, the Globe published unchallenged, dissenting frames including protester-friendly angles, explorations of excessive police force, coverage of curtailed civil rights and others. Table 3.4 Globe frames that challenged or disrupted official, authoritative frames/total articles Percentage of dissenting frames 9/62 14.5%  Consider the following excerpt from a first person essay written by Cinders McLeod, the Globe\\u2019s design editor. In it McLeod recalls his own background as an activist in Britain during the 1980s and his sense that the G8-G20 protests would provide a good opportunity to introduce his young children to protest and participatory democracy: I thought since the detention centre was local and far away from the G20 security zone, it would be a gentle introduction into the peaceful art of protest. I cared for the community, I cared for the people who were unjustly detained and I cared that my children cared too\\u2026There were young folk, folk my age, folk with dogs, folk with children on their shoulders, older folk and media\\u2026With no warning, there was a sudden penetration and retreat in the crowd. The police had moved in for a couple of arrests. I called Diarmid and Anya in closer\\u2026without warning, police officers stormed the peaceful crowd, swinging their sticks and throwing people to the ground. I saw  27 Anya being pushed by one of the group of police. I screamed out her name. They threw the young man next to her to the ground. Diarmid ran toward the skirmish just as a kind boy pulled Anya out of the policemen's path. She looked so thin and vulnerable and 14 in her short shorts beside the black, violent swarm. The front line of protesters sat down again, hands held in the air in peace signs, chanting, \\u2018We are peaceful, how 'bout you.\\u2019 (L8)  McLeod\\u2019s experience culminates as he flees with his children down a nearby alley. While making their escape, McLeod was hit in the back with a rubber bullet -- a burst, he speculates, from the gun of a police officer. McLeod\\u2019s account represents an independent perspective, speaking to the issue of excessive force against protesters, and the diminishment of free speech. Its major premise though is supported by much of the scholarship on the media\\u2019s pre-occupation with protest violence (regardless of the perpetrators) rather than investigating protest motivations and thematic grievances (Gitlin 1980; Boykoff 2006; Boyle et al 2006). While McLeod provides a captivating, albeit episodic, narrative about his family\\u2019s day among the protests, it still loses traction on the reasons for protesting in the first place and descends into yet another Toronto riot story anchored to violence. An overall assessment of the Globe\\u2019s coverage would not be complete without acknowledging a good example of introducing complexity, nuance and motivations regarding protesters or social movements, and one that is divorced from the monolithic violence frame. An essay by Annahid Dashtgard published in the Globe on June 25 exemplifies that. Dashtgard\\u2019s essay begins: \\u201cI am a protester. I believe in the power of mass groups of people gathering to stand up for an issue that would otherwise be invisible. I was there in Seattle in 1999 in the rise-up against the World Trade Organization, and in Quebec City for the protest against the Free Trade Area of the Americas in 2001.\\u201d  28 Dashtgard, according to her article, became interested in protesting following unsatisfying political party work in Edmonton. While working within the Canadian democratic system, she routinely fielded calls from \\u201csingle mothers unable to make welfare, students facing bankruptcy with ever-increasing tuition rates, recent immigrants with nowhere else to turn\\u201d and felt she unable to help them in a meaningful way. \\u201cAs a young woman wanting to make the world a better place, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of pain.\\u201d After meeting with a \\u201cseasoned union activist,\\u201d Dashtgard started arranging speakers, rallies and conferences to garner attention to various issues but quickly started asking \\u201chow much impact these mass protests were having on decisions being made?\\u201d Should she \\u201cjust accept that inequity was the name of the global economic game and make peace with it?\\u201d There were enough people encouraging her to move beyond a \\u201crebel\\u201d phase and accept the world for what it was. Yet she resisted. She recounts the positive and successful movements that she has been a part of in her life and she summarizes her perspective and her intentions thus: I am a Torontonian. I live in this city that is to be host to the G20 this weekend. And I am planning to protest\\u2026I will put my body on the line to march against this inequitable system where 20 nations make decisions affecting the whole world. Yet this time, instead of being supported in my right to protest, I find myself explaining why I am legitimate\\u2026Media coverage has mostly focused on disruption to businesses and traffic. Police have been harassing my friends already while they have been passing out flyers, riding bikes or just lying down in the park. My head can't help but feel despair of ever reaching that world where decisions are truly democratic, where eradicating poverty is more important than furthering profit\\u2026Surrounded by fear and fences, hope and passion for an equitable and democratic world can yet be set free. (L6)      29  4    Chapter: Discussion  4.1 Findings  To return to the hypothesis of whether the Globe and Mail found itself at odds with the messaging of protesters and social movements during the G8-G20, to discern if this was the case four aspects were assessed: sources, marginalization tendencies, trivialization tendencies, and the publication of dissenting perspectives. Firstly, when looking at how the articles about the protests were assembled it was found that 32 per cent of the sample coverage was framed by an authoritative source. This finding illuminates one of Herb Gans\\u2019s (2003) findings: \\u201cJournalists respect their official sources, reporting what these sources tell them. They may be critical of what they are told and of the sources themselves, but the sources usually have the first say, thereby putting the others in a reactive and as such inferior position\\u201d (46). That inferior position does not necessarily occur because of intentional de-emphasis of alternative voices (such as government critics, protesters or social movement participants) by journalists, but because of well-shaped relationships and networks among and between official newsmakers and news organizations and their reporters. In this regard, the Globe and Mail is no different than other Canadian commercial news organizations. The structures of media institutions that journalists work within often shape the news as much as a reporter\\u2019s own values and perspectives (Gans 45; Chomsky 3; Tuchman 4). Trying to make tight deadlines and provide credible reporting while working within corporate profit- seeking institutions can lead to dependence on official sources to establish the frames of news (Gans 49).  30 Voices in the news typically come from within institutions, organizations and structures that have channels built into them that streamline access for journalists who are working within demanding \\u201cmass production\\u201d circumstances (Gans 49). Spokespeople from law enforcement, government, and business mark a news story as legitimate in the eyes of news editors. These relationships are reciprocal; when the mayor of Toronto, or someone of that stature makes a statement, it\\u2019s most likely to be included in the story, and in some instances that information will provide the basis for an entire uncontested frame (49). Reporting the perspectives, opinions and ideas of officials or institutional stakeholders is easier and cheaper than spending hours in the field cultivating sources with unfamiliar participants, especially in a situation like the G8-G20 when news is breaking continuously and the appetite for information is high. There is not a complete dearth of communication between reporters and protesters, but often, those relationships are laboured (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 1993; Rohlinger 2002). Social movements and protesters, like the ones present on Toronto\\u2019s streets in June, look to the mainstream media to get their message out. In turn, the media expect activists to produce compelling news. This usually comes in the form of making \\u201ctrouble\\u201d (Gans 48). Turbulence makes for good TV and for attention-grabbing headlines, but the \\u201cdialogue of the deaf\\u201d between protesters and media usually fails to tease out nuanced objectives, motivations, and actual grievances directed at brokers of power by protesters (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 115). Reporters are often unfamiliar with protesters, and when the two parties come together to interact at a complicated and confusing venue like the G8-G20, there is often a breakdown in communication or none at all (115).  31 Social movements are diverse and complex. Some are fluid, loose, arrangements between individuals, and some are sophisticated networks with coherent public relations departments (Diani 2000; Rohlinger 2002; Cottle 2008). No matter the sort of organization, the movements and activists continue to depend on the mainstream media for mobilization, validation and scope enlargement (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 116). Many protesters lack the ability to communicate with the mainstream media and feel the pressures to attract attention by any means possible -- often relying on visually stimulating material favoured by mainstream media outlets (Gitlin 1980; Gamson, Wolfsfeld 1993; Boykoff 2006). When protesters do make into the core of a news story, it is no surprise that the confusing choreography between protesters and mainstream media lends itself to a frame dominated by violence and disruption -- it makes for simple, easy to report, captivating copy and footage.  The Globe and Mail\\u2019s use of official, authoritative sources (more than 30 per cent of the time) raises a question beyond the scope of this study: are reporters from the Globe establishing these dominant frames and then matching official sources to the narrative, or are official sources afforded the opportunity by the Globe to construct the frame of a story? The way the Globe sourced its coverage of the summit protests became a factor in its marginalization of protesters. The numbers show that in nearly half of the articles, protesters and the general protest narrative was pushed to the fringes and clouded by a monolithic riot and civic disruption frame. The primary tendencies within the Globe sample were; framing protesters as a violent and destructive bloc, emphasizing civic disruption as in opposition to a favoured business-as-usual perspective, failing to cover protesters as diverse, pluralistic entities, and by basing observations on stereotypes.  32 In the weeks and months following the summit weekend (beyond the date parameters of this study) a lot of news coverage was dedicated to exploring police brutality, civil rights and the ISU\\u2019s approach to security. Many stories have come out about journalists who were detained among the protesters and bystanders throughout the weekend. Yet as the news broke during the summit from the streets of Toronto, the narrative was markedly different. This could be due, in part, to the comfort that the media has in reporting what the police disseminate. Typically, the relationship between police and reporters is a formalized exchange and the policeman as a source is rarely marginalized. \\u201cCrime stories sell papers, and reporters rely almost exclusively on police reports and official accounts to relay events to the public. This relationship, in the case of large-scale civil unrest, compromises journalistic integrity\\u201d (Paletz, Entman 1981, 111). \\u201cWhen the power to define news is, in effect, turned over to the police, the media are serving to confirm the existing control mechanisms in society\\u201d (Gitlin 43). It\\u2019s predictable then that when police are afforded the foremost opportunity to tell their story about a major social justice challenge to the status quo, that narrative will undoubtedly emphasize violence. (Paletz, Entman 111). In Toronto, when Chief Blair spoke of \\u201ccriminals,\\u201d and \\u201cviolence\\u201d he was correct to think that his words could activate a  \\u201ccultural strumming15\\u201d that would make its way into headlines and stories and would help shape the overall G8-G20 narrative while the summit unfolded. Police rhetoric during the summit routinely conflated violence with vandalism and civic disruption (recall Chief Blair\\u2019s criminality frame, page 22). Much of that information was reiterated by official sources from within the political and business  15 By \\u201ccultural strumming\\u201d Entman is not suggesting that the media indoctrinates a passive public. Rather the waterfall-like discourse arrives to public from above and then mixes within the \\u201cpool\\u201d of public opinion but then gets \\u201cpumped\\u201d back up into institutions and organizations by way of its parts, its individuals.  33 community resulting in a \\u201ccascading activation\\u201d of language that may have resulted in the construction of the dominant violence frame (Entman 2003, 415). Reliance on posited stereotypes can reduce plurality and diversity among protesters down to a marginalized catch-all (Gitlin 1980). By reporting voiceless character descriptions like \\u201cthe young bearded activist with torn jeans\\u201d or the \\u201cFrench speaking protesters\\u201d reporters paint the protesters and protests with a singular colour that maintains existing stereotypes about protesters and their intentions. It\\u2019s difficult to measure what these sorts of observations are meant to convey, yet focusing on age, language, facial hair, and dress can act to mark participants as either inside or outside normative hegemony. These characteristics may symbolize: \\u201cthese people are young, un-kept, idealistic, and francophone (read: from elsewhere).\\u201d This frame can destabilize their messaging and it provides information to readers absent of context and meaning. Stereotypes and intellectual shorthand starve readers of a more comprehensive understanding about the issues that social movements and protesters are seeking to highlight during something as significant as a global political, economic and social summit. Yes, the protester may be young, they may be idealistic, but what they have to say still has meaning and is an important contribution to social order at the local, national and global levels. Out of the sample of articles, about one-fifth trivialized protesters and made light of protesters\\u2019 intentions, effectiveness and character. Predictably, most of these instances were found within the paper\\u2019s opinion columns where there is a greater mandate for colour and entertainment. When a reporter shares their impressions about social movements or protesters they often do so by contrasting what they see, against what they consider acceptable and legitimate (Gitlin 69).  34 This study did not find a tendency to use frivolous quotation marks, but it did find a reliance on superficial observations to create trivial, de-stabilizing frames. When Christie Blatchford comments (p.20) on \\u201cspectacular\\u201d and \\u201cbizarre\\u201d claims among detainees she\\u2019s enacting a frame that makes light of the participants\\u2019 testimonies. When Marcus Gee bases his impressions (p.25) of the G8-G20 protesters on a few guys with \\u201cmarijuana-leaf kerchiefs\\u201d and people in \\u201cninja suits,\\u201d he\\u2019s cheapening the overall meaning of why so many people were there doing what they felt was important and necessary. The next step then is to ask: where does this formulation of what is legitimate and what is normal come from? 4.2 Hegemony  The Globe and Mail newspaper is jointly owned by Woodbridge Company Ltd, the primary shareholder in Thomson Reuters, a publicly traded, international media giant, and BCE -- Canada\\u2019s largest telecommunications company also known as Bell16. Though it\\u2019s the typical business model for newspapers and media organizations to operate as for-profit, commercial enterprises, it is still worthwhile to think about how stories about protest and disruption to social, economic and political order get dealt with by a newspaper that is part of a hegemonic system that depends on political economic continuity. Social movement activism that seeks to disrupt pro-capitalist governance, and social, political and economic hegemony is at odds with many of the values of elite, commercial media (Gitlin 1980; Paletz, Entman 1981; Lee, Craig 1992; Chomsky 1997; Gans 2003). Protesters, by design, question that status quo and seek to disrupt it through collective action and mobilization (Klandermans 1997).  16 Information available at: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/10/c8647.html  35 It is too simple to think about why the Globe would handle protesters and social movements in such a way without thinking about the newspaper\\u2019s position within existing systems of social, political and economic power. The Globe and Mail is a collection of individuals, organizations and institutions that are all, without exception, part of intersecting networks that change, become motivated, evolve and adapt in fluid, reciprocal and unpredictable ways. There are particular institutional, commercial interests at stake in the news media, and many of those companies\\u2019 relationships and networks are formed on that basis (Chomsky 1997; Tuchman 1978). Relationships are rarely equal and as Chomsky pointedly puts it: \\u201cIt\\u2019s not that reporters don\\u2019t have the freedom to do their job properly or independently, it\\u2019s that organizations don\\u2019t hire dissenters or they weed out individuals who don\\u2019t conform to the approved status quo\\u201d (4). When looking at the relationship between say, the Globe and Mail, its reporters, and any given reader of the daily iteration of the paper, the way that a story about protesters is framed will have an impact on how a reader relates to those protesters. 4.3 Media effects  What then are the effects of such coverage on public opinion? As just mentioned, theories that assume that the audience or readership passively swallows everything the media gives them are outdated and overly simplistic (Gitlin 1980; Gans 2003; Schudson 2003; Entman 2003; Carragee, Roefs 2004). Many scholars appear to be in agreement that the mainstream media interacts with society in a fluid, reciprocal fashion. Editors and reporters are part of a public. Schudson, in particular, finds that the mass media has little, in any, ability to tell the public how to think, though it can emphasize topics and amplify aspects of the public conversation. In other words, the mass media and its components like the Globe  36 and Mail can set the agenda of topics for Canadians, but it will not indoctrinate them (Schudson 29). Studies of media effects must explore the demand (what the public is interested in hearing) as much as the supply (what the mainstream media is interested is showing) (Gans 2003). The media consists of individuals; they\\u2019re members of communities and parts of dominant culture (71). The news can initiate topics, inform, legitimate, emphasize, and affirm previously held perspectives within mainstream culture, politics and society (71, 72). With that in mind it could be reasoned then that the Globe and Mail did not tell Canadians what to think about protesters at the G8-G20, but by establishing a dominant frame of \\u201cprotest as civic disruption\\u201d it neglected to widen and contextualize the public discourse mandate regarding social movements and protests at the summit. The Globe\\u2019s dominant frame may have constricted the protest-conversation agenda. In 1980, Gitlin wrote that The New York Times set the standard for \\u201cpack journalism\\u201d (98). If the New York Times validated an event with its coverage, it wouldn\\u2019t take long for affiliates, the wire service, or other news outlets hungry for stories, to republish or cover the same story and with similar frames. We must ask: in 2011 does the Globe and Mail set that same standard? 4.4 The end of the information gatekeeper?  The way we are communicating is changing (Castells 2007, 239). Before the rise of the Internet as a tool for mass communication, if a story (or a story angle) didn\\u2019t make it into the media, it didn\\u2019t make it to the public agenda (241). New opportunities for networked, or \\u201cmany-to-many\\u201d communication has shifted the balance of power in the dissemination of information. The role that information gatekeepers like the Globe play is becoming less  37 important; the power of those institutions is deteriorating. To what extent though is not yet known. What is clear is that information has become cheaper; journalism less professionalized (Shirky 58). Today\\u2019s media ecology provides new political opportunities for organizations and individuals to get their message out beyond the structures of the mass media and its agenda-setting function (Cottle 2008; Shirky 2008). In Toronto, anyone on the street with a smart phone could record images and footage, and broadcast immediately via Twitter. Bloggers and tweeters stimulated information while it bypassed the Globe and Mail. On June 27, police forces in Toronto converged on a group G8-G20 protesters and bystanders at the street corner of Queen and Spadina17. Over a short period, a peaceful, yet agitated group of people waited, penned on all sides by a wall of police. Tensions escalated when police broke the front line, seizing protesters, and pulling them away from confused family, friends and onlookers despite the seemingly peaceful nature of the situation. That footage wasn\\u2019t shot by news cameras or reporters (a version was eventually posted on the Globe\\u2019s website). It was captured by a participant, and uploaded on YouTube for the whole world to see. The footage is telling. It\\u2019s raw; it\\u2019s without police or government interpretation. It has no frame. It\\u2019s clear that people are relying less on media to determine what they ought to, and what they will see, read or hear (Castells 2007; Cottle 2008; Shirky 2008).     17 Footage of the protest can be viewed on YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aohGLp00MmU&playnext=1&list=PLCDDB203E9E1C E271&index=11.   38 5    Chapter: Final Thoughts  Healthy communities require active communication and exchange. In liberal democracies, our institutions are only sufficient to secure the idea of democracy (Dewey 1922, 144). Without public feedback, criticism and action democratic institutions will remain unchecked. The media has a role to facilitate that exchange. Let\\u2019s think back to Marcus Gee\\u2019s assertion that the foremost protest messages tended to circulate around a \\u201cfuck law and order\\u201d paradigm, an interesting statement but one that misses the point -- that it\\u2019s the Globe\\u2019s role within Canadian society to get beyond that simple, episodic narrative. The G8-G20 in Toronto was a complex situation with a variety of different events, players and situations. Nearly half of the Globe\\u2019s frames marginalized the messaging of protesters by clouding the social movement story with a darker, monolithic riot story. Preoccupied with violence and disruption, the Globe shares the responsibility in stimulating and creating that dominant frame. It set the protesters at the G8-G20 agenda as one preoccupied with violence and civic disruption. Apart from a few examples of dissenting accounts and explanations by protesters (see McLeod and Dashtgard p.26-28), The Globe did little to bypass official narratives of the protesters posited by government, police and business, and it failed to get beyond the riot story and explore protester\\u2019s themes, motivations and objectives in a thematic way. Presumably many protesters and social movement organizations arrived in Toronto hoping to share a more nuanced and coherent message with the public than the one that was delivered, and presumably too, much of the public found those issues worthy of attention. If the Globe, or any other elite, commercial news organization fails to report in a more robust, comprehensive way, the public will be quick to look to the growing list of alternative sources  39 for unfiltered information. This is not to say that covering turbulent protests thoughtfully and critically is easy. It\\u2019s a challenge to be sure, but if it\\u2019s not the role of a respected, national, commercial news organization like the Globe to use its resources to do it, then others may step in and fill the information gap. This thesis solely takes the current temperature of one elite, commercial media outlet\\u2019s coverage of one instance of social movement activism in a Canadian context. It acknowledges some of the foundational literature on frame and social movement theory and pulls it through a tract of Globe and Mail coverage of protesters during the G8-G20 in Toronto -- a worthy and timely case study for social justice activism and Canadian media attention. The summit provided an opportunity for the media to participate in conversations about global social justice and Canada\\u2019s role in an increasingly globalized world, but also provided an opportunity to test mainstream media coverage of a mega-protest event in Canadians\\u2019 back yard. Through discourse analysis, and quantified research, this research explored the Globe\\u2019s sources, marginalization of protesters, trivialization of protesters and affordance of dissenting frames. The finding that stands out among the rest is that in nearly half of the sample coverage the Globe marginalized protesters by treating them as a violent, disruptive monolith and contrasted their story against a dominant frame that prioritized business-as-usual. This research does not explore the Globe\\u2019s coverage of G8-G20 news that did not reference protesters specifically. It may be the case that the Globe dedicated a tract of copy to issues pertaining to social justice, globalization, and Canada\\u2019s role in international diplomacy. Those topics, though, did not turn up in articles pertaining to protest, so we can suspect that social movement activism and protest is not treated by the Globe and Mail as a  40 portal into conversations about global social inequality, as much as it considers it an avenue into a discussion about civic disruption. Research like this usually opens the door to more questions than it answers. There are two particular issues that arose here that deserve more attention in the future. First, the issue of reporting on protest violence. In the Canadian context (and exemplified by the Globe) vandalism and violence tend to get used interchangeably. Breaking windows or damaging property is regularly described as violence, and interpreted as such by the public. Yet as part of a large-scale social, economic, and political uprising throughout other parts of the world today, the discourse of \\u201cviolence\\u201d is getting routinely subverted into a discourse of \\u201cresistance,\\u201d \\u201crevolution,\\u201d and \\u201cfreedom.\\u201d Are there, or will there be instances in a Canadian context where breaking a window or damaging a car is not just justified, but necessary in order to draw attention to the need for social, political and economic change? Secondly, this paper criticizes the reporting of the Globe and Mail but does little to explore how covering protesters and social movements can be done better. What then, could best practises look like in a complex, turbulent situation like the G8-G20? How should reporters approach their story telling? If the predictable narrative told of protesters and protest events is a riot story, how can news organizations get beyond that?             41 Bibliography  Agrell, Siri. \\u201cTorontonians try to make sense of G20 vandalism.\\u201d The Globe and Mail 27 June 2010: A10.

Journalism, whose enthusiasm and dedication make it easy be excited about journalism research. I owe particular thanks to my supervisors. Dr. Mary Lynn Young, whose mentorship and advice made this thesis possible, offered innumerable astute insights and recommendations. Her questions and confidence in me were instrumental in performing this research. I also owe special thanks Dr. Robert Picard, whose feedback prompted me to think more deeply and rigorously about what my research means. Finally, I wish to thank the inspiring intellectual community at Green College for their rigorous questions and words of encouragement. v Dedication To my parents, for everything. vi Chapter 1: Introduction This study examines CBC Radio's audience performance between 1999 and 2007 against its private sector competitors. It compares measured audience market share against expected average market share on a province-by-province basis, replicating a 2002 study authored by Robert Picard that pioneered this method and applied it to various European public service broadcasters (PSBs) (Picard 2002a). Picard found that most European PSBs exceed statistical expectations for their market share, and in most cases led their respective markets (ibid.). Research suggests that Canadians generally feel that the CBC's use of the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars it receives each year is justified (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 2003, 190). Canadians' feelings in this regard, however, hinge largely on the use they make of the CBC \\u2013 non-use value accounts for somewhere between 25% and none of their perceived value of the CBC (ibid.). Better understanding the market performance of the CBC (i.e., how much it is used compared to its competitors) further refines our knowledge of how it relates to the audience it serves. Picard's approach makes market share data more meaningful by accounting for the number of competing media outlets in a given market to generate statistical expectations of average outlet performance (Picard 2002a). Applying it to the CBC will further our understanding of how it fares against its competition. CBC Radio's national audience was roughly 3.8 million people between 2005 and 2007 (CBC Annual Report 2006-2007, 37, CBC Annual Report 2005-2006, 27), representing its largest audience share in eight years (StatsCan, 2008). That share varied from 9% to 12% in the last 10 years of data available from Statistics Canada (ibid.). While these detail the scope of CBC's listenership, they do not communicate anything about how competition affects PSB market share \\u2013 an important consideration, given the impact of increased competition on the CBC's television operations (Eillis 1991, quoted in Hoskins and 1 McFayden 1992, 275). To date, research done on many aspects of the CBC and its audience appears underdeveloped (Eaman 1994, ix). Ien Ang offers a powerful warning against leaning too heavily on ratings in her book Desperately Seeking the Audience. Ratings view the audience from a perspective above or outside it, portraying the audience as an objectified group needing to be shaped, manipulated, or controlled (Ang 1991, 5). They are a way of \\u201cmaking the audience visible in such a way that it helps the institutions to increase their power to get their relationship with the audience under control\\u201d (ibid., 7). This applies, she argues, regardless of whether an audience is thought of as a collection of citizens or as a public in need of education, information, entertainment, and possible reform so they may better perform their democratic function (ibid.). Audiences are controllable, external objects (ibid., 5).  In practice, according to Ang, any attempts to reform an audience will fail because reform demands an understanding of audiences that goes beyond what ratings can provide (ibid., 103). The suggestion that ratings are not the only tool required to understand the performance of a PSB has traction, but that is not to say ratings are unnecessary. Ratings, while not the only tool needed to understand a PSB's performance, can still be meaningful and useful for doing so. Broadcasting aiming to serve the public can only fulfil that goal if the public in question tunes in. Studying ratings is an important component of understanding public service broadcasting. This is confirmed by their appearance in PSB studies. For example, Lund and Berg's 2009 study uses comparative analysis of television PSB ratings performance in Denmark, Sweden and Norway from 1987 to 2006 to discuss government policy's relationship with market share (Lund and Berg, 2009). Nord and Ibarra's work on the television PSBs of Spain and Sweden between 1995 and 2005 uses market share as a measure of a PSB's performance 2 (Nord and Ibarra 2008, 11). PSBs also use ratings to justify themselves to the publics they serve (e.g., CBC Annual Report 2005-2006). This study's main research question is, \\u201chow does the actual audience performance of the CBC on a province-by-province basis compare with statistical expectations of audience performance between 1999 and 2007?\\u201d Answering this question will further our understanding of CBC Radio's performance in relation to private broadcasters \\u2013 an important consideration to the extent that public service broadcasting aims at different ends than private broadcasting. As will be shown, such a difference exists and PSBs serve an important function in modern democratic life. The CBC is no exception to this.  Indeed, as the Committee on Canadian Heritage found in 2008, the CBC is Canada's only national radio broadcaster delivering education, culture and entertainment from coast to coat in both English and French (Committee on Canadian Heritage 2008, quoted on insidethecbc.com 2008). Given CBC Radio's long history and prestigious reputation, it seems likely that any comparison with its private competitors will reflect favourably on the Corporation. Concern about the continued viability of PSBs in Europe has garnered attention at least since the early 1980s. Garnham, writing in 1983, expressed fear that the BBC was in the process of slowly transforming into a de facto commercial station in the face of competition from the commercially-oriented network Independent Television (ITV)  (Garnham 1983, 23). In 1998, Tracey compared preserving PSB into the new millennium to \\u201cthe preservation of primeval bugs in amber\\u201d (Tracey, 1998, 33). Lange argues that corporate convergence and technological innovation could undermine public service broadcasting across Europe (Lange 2006, 1). Picard describes PSBs in Europe as facing increased competition and market upheaval from the early 1980s to 2002 (Picard 2002a, 227). However, research on public service broadcasting in Canada has tended to focus on matters of broadcasting policy (e.g. Raboy 1990). This research will focus on the influence of competition on a PSB in Canada. 3 In 1972, Canadian broadcasting pioneer Graham Spry gave a speech in Ottawa in which he identified the ultimate aim of broadcasting in Canada as producing a strategy of identity (Spry 1975, 89)1. Spry advocated a specific remedy to the looming problem of cultural assimilation into the United States: the reformation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the increased circulation of its programs (ibid., 93-94). If control of communication can foster community, the best way for a community to ensure its continuity is to control its communication. This is best done through one of the primary organs of large- scale collective action, government. Therefore, Spry considered government-funded broadcasting as a viable tool for nation-states concerned with their cultural sovereignty (ibid., 93). Given Spry's influential role in founding the Canadian Radio League and lobbying the federal government to create a national public broadcaster in the 1930s (Babe 2000, 40-41), his advocacy of CBC reform and promotion might not be surprising. Equating, on some level, the fate of a PSB with that of a democratic nation-state, however, is not a radical idea; scholarly examples are manifold. Ferguson argues that public service broadcasting and nationalist values are deeply entwined in English-speaking Canada (Ferguson 2006, 192). Splichal also contends that the ideal of public-service media sits at the heart of the ideas of publicness and democratic government (Splichal 2006, 17), while Garnham presents public service broadcasting as a necessary alternative to commercial broadcasting which, if unchallenged, will strip a nation-state of its strategic and cultural power (Garnham 1983, 27). Tracey goes so far as to regard the decline of public service broadcasting in Britain as a challenge to \\u201cthe whole character of our lives, ... principles and values and moral systems\\u201d and, indeed, democracy itself (Tracey 1998, xvi). Raboy contends that \\u201cthe fundamental question of democracy\\u201d lies at the heart of all the debates surrounding communication, culture, and public service broadcasting (Raboy 1990, 355). Though none of these thinkers 4 take a uniformly positive view of PSBs \\u2013 Garnham, for example, critiques the British Broadcasting Corporation as too eager to serve the state and ruling elites at the expense of the working class (Garnham 1983, 25) \\u2013 they all agree that PSBs can play a vital role in serving the interests of the citizens of a nation-state and in some fashion contribute to that state's cohesion and continuity. This study is important because it will measure an under-studied aspect of the performance of a Crown corporation with a unique mandate and an annual budget that approached $2 billion in 2008-2009 (CBC Annual Report 2008-2009, 61). The measurement will be done in a fashion that makes it easier to avoid the common confusion around the importance of market shares and the causes of changes in those shares (Picard 2002a, 228). It also adds to what we know about how well CBC Radio fulfils its unique mandate to cultivate national identity in Canada (Broadcast Act 1991, 3(1)(m)). Meeting this goal may have been more difficult between 1999 and 2007 (the period examined in this study) than in previous years. As Picard points out in The Economics and Financing of Media Companies, media outlets must compete with other outlets in the same format (intramedia competition) and with outlets of all formats (intermedia competition) (Picard 2002b, 149-150). The Internet may have made each audience member into a potential competitor for the CBC: as Shirky writes in Here Comes Everybody, in the modern world everyone with access to the Internet is a potential media outlet (Shirky 2008, 55). Getting them to pay attention to a single given outlet is therefore more difficult than ever before. Measuring the CBC's effectiveness in recent years is thus a matter of some interest. This is complicated by the status of multiculturalism in Canada. Modern media and transport technologies increasingly allow immigrants to feel themselves members of what Karim dubs trans-nations; diasporic communities that overlap traditional national borders (Karim, 2006, 272). This tendency can subvert mass communications systems, which 5 potentially reinforce belief in the political validity of a nation-state (ibid., 269). Canada, with a higher per capita immigration rate than any European nation excepting the Isle of Mann, Luxembourg and San Marino (CIA World Factbook, 2010) may be more susceptible to this phenomenon than European countries. Canada, as a former British colony, also has a long history of immigration. Examining the performance of PSB in Canada over the period of time examined in this study is thus important and interesting. 6 Chapter 2: Literature Review My work aims to better understand the condition of public service broadcasting in Canada, and is situated within the scholarly debates about public service broadcasting and competition between media outlets. As such, the literature review will comprise two sections. The first will address the role of public service broadcasting in Canada. The second will review the competitive landscape of radio broadcasters in Canada in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries and studies of that landscape. 2.1 Broadcasting and Public Service in Canada As the original public service broadcaster, the BBC operates under a royal charter which obliges it \\u201cto inform, to educate and to entertain; to report the proceedings of Parliament; to provide a political balance\\u201d (Crisell 2002, 28). This broadly characterizes the purpose of public service broadcasting since its birth, including in Canada: to inform citizens of the activities of their government, to build social capital in one way or another and to treat the audience as a group of citizens. Kees Brants argues that the ideal PSB makes available what \\u201cthe public needs in order to participate fully as democratic citizens\\u201d in public life (Brants 2003, 8). Though funded by the state (and therefore the public), public service broadcasting is more than just broadcasting funded by the public (Eaman 1992, 59). As Barnett and Docherty write, public service broadcasting is more about commitment to principles than ownership (Barnett and Docherty 1991, 24). Barnett and Docherty also offer a useful theoretical framework for interpreting public service in broadcasting. Based on a report from the British Broadcasting Unit, they explicate eight criteria that an ideal PSB fulfils. The first is universal access to the broadcast, regardless of location (Barnett and Docherty 1991, 26-27). The second criteria is providing programming that appeals to the media preferences of the entire population (ibid., 27-28). The third criteria is universality of payment \\u2013 that is, since the entire population can access 7 the PSB's materials, the entire population ought to pay for it in some fashion, whether it be through license fee, government subsidy, or some other means (ibid., 29-30). Fourth, argue Barnett and Docherty, the ideal PSB is free from any sort of external interference, be it political or commercial, with its mandate or capacity to fulfil that mandate (ibid., 30-32). The fifth criteria for the ideal PSB is that it recognize its special mandate to provide coverage of national interests, events, and culture and thereby \\u201cfoster a sense to national identity\\u201d (ibid., 32). The sixth criteria requires that a PSB be especially conscious of the interests and preferences of minorities, both ethnic and otherwise (ibid., 33-34). The seventh criteria contends that the ideal PSB must be allowed and encouraged to experiment with programming (ibid., 34-35). Finally, though the ideal PSB will compete with other broadcasters for excellence in programming, it should not, argue Barnett and Docherty, engage in an obsessive contest for the most viewers or listeners (ibid., 35-36). These criteria provide a lens through which we may examine the work of other scholars studying PSBs. For example, Christopher Hanretty's method of analysing the de facto political independence of PSBs evaluates them on the basis of Barnett and Docherty's fourth criteria (Hanretty 2010). The CBC ranks below the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), but above the PSBs of countries such as New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, France, and South Africa (ibid.). Irene Costera Meijer investigates potential tension between the first (universality of appeal) and seventh (competition for programming quality, not audience numbers) of Barnett and Docherty's criteria (Costera Meijer 2005). She argues that quality and popularity should be weighed equally as goals for PSBs (ibid., 47). Christian Nissen  studies one dimension of the fifth of Barnett and Docherty's criteria; that PSBs should foster a sense of national unity and identity. Using statistical data from the European Audiovisual Observatory, Nissen describes the programming profile of various television PSBs and commercial broadcasters in Europe (Nissen 2006, 78). He concludes that 8 European PSBs generally air more news and information-oriented programming than their private competitors, and presents this as evidence PSBs attempting to fulfil their broadcasting mandates (ibid., 78-79). This fifth criteria is perhaps the most important to consider for Raboy, a leading critic of the CBC. Raboy contends in his comprehensive accounting of public service broadcasting in Canada that for most of its life the CBC has fused the ideas of public and state interests (Raboy 1990, 8). These interests, Raboy claims, generally fall into one of three categories: preventing Canada's conquest in whatever form by the United States, suppressingQuebec separatism, and protecting the market to allow commercial interests to flourish (ibid., 336). To achieve this, Raboy argues, the Canadian government routinely places financial and political pressure on the CBC, routes broadcasting through Ottawa and Toronto (ibid., 340), and, through the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), resists proposals to set up alternative public broadcasters (ibid., 340). This results in a public service broadcasting system that treats its audience as a mass rather than as a public (ibid.)  \\u2013 that is, as a numerous, spread-out, anonymous collection of individuals with relatively little in common and no ability to organize or act, rather than as an active, organized body of citizens engaged in political discourse (McQuail 2000, 41-42). Raboy lays out five requirements for improving public service broadcasting in Canada and moving towards treating audiences like publics. They include expanding the levels of government that influence PSBs, defining the question of cultural sovereignty in a broader context, and increasing public participation in public broadcasting (Raboy 1990, 355-356). The public interest, he argues, means allowing the different and conflicting publics that make up Canadian society to coexist equally and peacefully (ibid., 356). Public service broadcasting, by extension, would be broadcasting that furthers this goal, and this is currently repressed in Canada through the primacy of cultural sovereignty in Canadian PSBs (ibid.). 9 Raboy's critique of the CBC challenges the notion that it functions as a PSB in the true sense, and other scholars have criticized the CBC as an instrument of nationalism (e.g. Filion 1996, Ferguson 2007) or simply accepted that this is so (e.g. O'Neil 2006). While this study analyses the audience performance of the CBC and not the qualities of its programming or policies, it is still based on the assumption that understanding the leading PSB in Canada (i.e., the CBC) is important. It may well be the case that the CBC too often conflates the interests of the federal government with the interests of the public, but it remains the oldest national public broadcaster in Canada (CBC Annual Report 2006-2007, 17). Barring the creation of an entirely new government-funded national broadcaster, which seems unlikely given modern political attitudes toward funding the already-established one (e.g. ibid.), the CBC is the largest PSB in the country. Recent research from Finn, McFayden and Hoskins at the University of Alberta found that Canadians feel the CBC is worth the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars it receives each year (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 2003, 190). Therefore, it remains a unique part of the Canadian media landscape and an important one to study. Ferguson, surveying print media coverage of the 2005 CBC lockout, sees public service broadcasting in Canada as a stronghold of the democratic ideals of public participation and access (Ferguson 2007, 197). Programming produced and consumed by the public, Ferguson argues, would make public service broadcasting enrich Canadian society and public life, and make Canada more democratic (ibid.). However, she contends that the CBC's behaviour makes it de facto a tool of nationalism, albeit a democratic and representational nationalism (ibid.). Certainly, nationalism is abundant in some of the CBC's defence of itself (e.g., Basen 2003). Ferguson does not define the CBC solely as a means to defend national identity in Canada \\u2013 rather, she argues that nationalism dominates other conventional PSB values like high journalistic standards and accessibility (ibid.). She ends 10 her study of the lockout by admonishing the CBC for its state-centric orientation and encouraging it to allow greater public participation in the future (ibid.). Prang lays out a similar state-centric view of the CBC's function as Raboy. Government support for the creation of a national broadcaster (i.e., the CBC) grew out of concern for broadcasting's potential to blur the boundaries of national identity (Prang 1965, 3). This blurring made real the possibilities of American cultural annexation (ibid.) and Quebecois separatism (ibid., 10). Prang describes the CBC as the national government's answer to Graham Spry's famous statement that \\u201cthe question is the State of the United States\\u201d (Spry, quoted in Prang 1965, 28). If Prang is right and public service broadcasting is first and foremost used by policy makers as a tool of national unity designed to prevent the northward cultural march of the United States, the validity of Raboy's critique seems given. Eaman, a scholar at the Carleton University School of Journalism and Communication, analyses the CBC from the perspective of audience research. Using archival sources from the CBC's audience research department and interviews with CBC employees, he argues that response to audience preferences, as discerned through audience research, plays a vital role in public service broadcasting (Eaman 1994, ix). According to Eaman, the CBC generally fails to respond to audience preferences and tastes in a meaningful way in both radio and television (ibid., 226). He points out audience ratings in particular as misleading instruments in this regard, as they show simply what is being consumed, not what audience members want to consume or what they think of it; at their worst ratings are used to determine the staying power of content-production formulas in the market (ibid., 144). He proposes a new model of audience research for the CBC to embrace: public participation, wherein the Canadian public is allowed to set basic broadcasting priorities and goals which the CBC then strives to meet (ibid., 224-226). 11 Eaman holds ratings to be of low equality and moderate meaningfulness (ibid., 162) for PSBs because they don't in-and-of themselves indicate any substantive audience interaction with the programming and they favour heavy users over light users (ibid., 145- 146). Accounting for competition's influence on market share makes partial redress of these problems, since it weighs ratings against statistical expectations. That 4 in 10 people listen to a given radio station means less than the knowledge that 4 in 10 do so in a market where the average broadcaster is expected to garner 2 in 10. Since ratings compare media outlets of the same format, this can indicate more clearly that people may prefer Outlet A's content over Outlet B's \\u2013 a meaningful distinction. Competition between media outlets is different than competition between most other businesses (Picard 2002b, 139). This review now turns to an overview of the scholarly literature on competition between radio outlets in Canada. 2.2 Radio Competition in Canada Media outlets do not compete with one another in the same way that other business do. As Picard states in The Economics and Financing of Media Companies, compared to beer producers, shoe retailers, detergent manufacturers or farmers, competition among media firms in the same format (e.g., newspapers)  is notably lower because of relatively limited choice of outlets (ibid., 139). Substitutability between different formats of media outlets is comparatively limited (e.g., a television station and a radio station substitute less well for each other than a pizza and a hamburger) (ibid., 139-140). This further lessens competition between them (ibid., 139). However, competition among media firms has increased globally in recent decades, and there is still high competition to hold market leader position (ibid.). Competition between media producers of the same format tends to be highest when the producers target the same 12 audiences in the same location (ibid., 151). Intramedia competition is generally stronger than intermedia competition (ibid., 150-152).  Competition is highest in markets with many firms and low product differentiation and barriers to entry (ibid., 149). Picard argues that the more power a single firm holds in a media market, the worse that market will operate (ibid., 141). Radio stations are not immune to this, but their competitive relationships can be distorted by government funding (Berry and Waldfogel 1999, 190). For example, Berry and Waldfogel, though regression modelling of market share with various sociological data, found that public funding of jazz and classical music stations in the United States crowded out private stations that would serve the same audiences (ibid., 210). They argue private stations would provision for jazz and classical music audiences in large markets in particular (ibid., 209), though they stop short of suggesting that public funding to stations of this kind in said markets should be reduced (ibid., 210). It is interesting to note that many studies of American radio find a healthy degree of competition between stations (e.g., Greve 1996, Compaine 1985). This is not the case for Canada, where concerns about media ownership monopolies have persisted since at least 1977 (Beatty, 1977). Beatty, surveying the history of media ownership in Canada, highlighted the tendency of any Canadian media market, including radio markets, to tend towards fewer and fewer competitors over time because of mergers and acquisitions (ibid., 13). Beatty cites a theoretical example put forward by Leibling of a newspaper market with multiple firms (Leibling, quoted in Beatty, 1977, 13.). It is tremendously lucrative, he argues, for any firm that can afford the expenditure to buy out all others (even if this means paying much more than market value for them), since this will allow for monopolistic leverage (ibid.) and exorbitant future profits. Beatty argues that Canada experiences increased concentration of ownership each successive year, and that this harms Canadian journalism and public life (Beatty 1977, 15). 13 For him, competition is necessary for the proper functioning of both  media markets and Canadian democracy (ibid.). Surveying the Canadian media landscape in 1977, he saw a severe competition deficit (ibid., 20).  However, he remains skeptical that unregulated private enterprise will produce the required level of competition, and he cites numerous failed policies attempting to promote competition and divergent media ownership (ibid., 11, 14, 17). More recent scholarship on telecommunications competition in Canada also describes a competition deficit. Globerman, Janisch and Stanbury, reviewing the decision-making of the CRTC, found that it operated to promote cultural nationalism and diminish protectionist fears of American cultural invasion (Globerman, Janisch and Stanbury 1996, 156-157). They argue that Decision 94-19, which dealt with long-distance telephone service, is representative of the protectionist stance of the CRTC and the influence that established broadcasting interests and cultural nationalists have as a lobby over the CRTC (ibid., 157). They contrast this with the situation in the United States, which is more open to competition (ibid.). The CRTC, they say, rejects basic economic advice for increasing the competition in an industry: \\u201creduce barriers to entry to the greatest extent possible\\u201d (ibid.). According to George, convergence \\u2013 the merger and acquisition of firms in the telecommunications industry to create fewer and fewer players in a given market \\u2013 peaked in Canada in the 1990s (George 2010, 556). This happened because the federal government and the CRTC liberalized broadcasting and telecommunications laws to allow for greater concentration of ownership (ibid., 557). This process continues across print, radio and television to this day, he argues (ibid.). George cites the 2007 purchase of the CHUM network (including its 33 radio stations) by CTVglobemedia as a more recent example of this (ibid.). He also argues that conglomerates like Rogers and CTVglobemedia make it increasingly difficult for new telecommunications firms to enter Canadian markets (ibid., 14 561). George contends that the Quebec broadcast media landscape is the least competitive in the country (ibid).  This concentration of ownership is potentially troubling, according to George. Concentration of media ownership can inhibit public discourse and media pluralism, partly because information professionals (e.g. journalists) tend to have limited employment choices (ibid.). Some scholars place the height of convergence at a different time. Winseck argues that concentration of ownership in broadcast media may be more acute now than at any time in the last 15 years (Winseck 2010, 365), while Finn, McFayden and Hoskins hold that it peaked in the 80s (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 1994). They approach the question of increased competition from a strategic perspective, reasoning that greater competition, which they associate with increased market convergence, demands more market-driven thinking from producers of cultural content (ibid.). Smaller producers, they hold, are at a competitive disadvantage compared to large (typically American) producers (ibid.). In radio, this effect is known as double jeopardy (Ehrenberg, Goodhart and Barwise 1990). McDowell and Dick define the double jeopardy effect as the tendency of less popular competitors in a market to accrue less customer loyalty per capita, while, conversely, more popular competitors accrue more customer loyalty than average (McDowell and Dick 2005, 272). Through the use of Arbitron quarter-hour listening diaries, they found modest evidence of the double jeopardy effect in the 100 most lucrative radio markets in the United States in 2002, though their analysis ignored non-commercial stations (ibid., 281, 278). If Winseck is right and convergence of media ownership is greater than ever in Canada (Winseck 2010, 365), new radio stations could suffer more from double jeopardy in Canada. He identifies ten media conglomerates that he argues control the majority of broadcasting and news in Canada: Shaw, Quebecor, Bell, Canwest, Astral Media, Torstar, Rogers, CTVglobemedia, Cogeco and CBC (Winseck 2010, 366). Through a survey of 15 financial records, he highlights two periods of marked conglomerate growth, the first from 1996-2000 and the second from 2003-2007 (ibid., 377). Winseck also deploys several competition metrics to assess how concentrated ownership of the Canadian media landscape really is for different formats. Competition ratios suggest that radio is less concentrated than newspapers or TV, but that it experienced a marked increase in concentration from the mid- 90s to roughly 2002 (ibid., 378). Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) scores, produced by squaring a firm's market share and then totalling all the squares to make a score between 100 (100 competitors with one percent market share) and 10,000 (one competitor with an absolute monopoly) suggest that radio ownership is slightly concentrated, though less so than television and newspapers (ibid., 379). Ultimately, he argues, this presents concerns for the health of media in Canada and therefore Canadian democracy (ibid., 388). McDowell and Dick also offer a conventional definition of audience share, which might be thought of as equivalent to market share for a broadcaster: they define audience share as the fraction of audience members tuned in to a given outlet or program divided by the total number of audience members (McDowell and Dick 2005, 272). But unaltered audience share is not as helpful as it could be in this regard, as it does not account for the degree of competition in a market. Addressing this problem with respect to CBC Radio's audience share in a small way is the aim of this research. The methods employed to do so will be discussed in the following section. 16 Chapter 3: Methodology 3.1 Research Approach This study is quantitative and examines the audience share of CBC Radio on a province-by-province basis across Canada against statistical expectations of average radio station performance, using a technique pioneered by Robert Picard in 2002. While qualitative methods like content analysis and in-depth interviews are appropriate for many aspects of mass media study, they are less useful for the objective of my research. Contributing towards a more accurate understanding of CBC Radio's market share across Canada demands the macroscopic perspective and precise language that numerical data and quantitative research provides. This study adopts two of the goals of audience research described by McQuail: assessing media performance and fulfilling obligations to serve a given audience (McQuail 2004, 365). Quantitative methods have a long history in communications research, where they contribute to the eventual formation of theory and causal explanations of the role of media in society (Gunter 2002, 209). Though proposing causal connections is beyond the scope of this study, it will still engage in their foundational enterprise: hypothesis proposal and testing (ibid.). This testing is done through statistical analysis of data acquired Statistics Canada, the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement (BBM), and the Canadian Communications Foundation. 3.2 Research Question An overview of the scholarly literature studying public-service broadcasting and audience performance has informed the research question this study seeks to answer: How 17 does CBC Radio's measured audience performance compare with statistical expectations across Canada on a province-by-province basis from 1999-2007? 3.3 Picard's Approach To Audience Performance This study's methodology is largely based on a technique first published by Robert Picard in 2002. Analyzing the audience performance of a variety of European television PSBs in the year 2000, Picard generated a measurement of a given PSB as follows: CMS \\u2013 EAAS = Channel Performance CMS stands for channel market share and EAAS stands for expected average market share (Picard 2002a, 231). For the purposes of this study, CMS will translate to station market share, or SMS. Based on the number of television channels in a given media market, EAAS represents statistical expectations of market share percentage. Picard calculated each EAAS value by dividing the number of channels in a market into 100 (ibid.). The equation produces a numerical score that represents a station's performance weighted against expectations of an average broadcaster in that station's market called the channel performance, or CP. A positive CP score represents performance above expectations while a negative score represents performance below expectations. Picard's technique is useful because it allows one to make more accurate comparisons of broadcaster performance across time and space, which can change a station's number of competitors and, therefore its EAAS value. For the purposes of this study, CP will be changed to station performance, or SP. To adapt Picard's method for this study, some tweaks were necessary. First, the available market share data relates to CBC Radio's performance at a provincial level, and multiple CBC stations exist in every province, often in the same market. To compensate, the 18 EAAS for a station in a given province and year was multiplied by the number of CBC stations in that province and year to produce an EAAS value for every CBC station in the province at the time. This change assumes a high degree of intra-CBC competition, producing demanding aggregate EAAS values for CBC Radio in each province. In his study, Picard takes a different approach and treats multiple channels operated by a PSB in a given market as one channel for the purposes of assessing PSB performance (Picard 2002, 231). This better reflects the fact that PSBs design different channels or stations in the same market to appeal to different segments of an audience. In the case of CBC Radio, we might think of Radio One and Radio Two, or of Premi\\u00e9re Cha\\u00eene and Espace Musique as examples of this strategy. Clearly, English-language news and general interest programming (i.e., Radio One) and French-language music (i.e., Espace Musique) target different audiences and thus avoid competing with each other to the same extent that two radio stations of very similar type would. Collapsing all of a PSB's outlets in a given market into one channel better reflects this. Yet some degree of competition exists between all outlets in a given market. One can, after all, only listen to one radio station at a time. To compensate for this, the data analysis was performed with both the more-competition and less-competition approaches and the results will be presented in tandem. The SP scores for the More Competition Model (MCM) are calculated as follows: Total CBC Market Share \\u2013 (EAAS x Number of CBC Stations in Market) = SP 19 These scores are premised on expectations of at least average market-share performance from each CBC station in a market \\u2013 a demanding assumption that produces lower SP scores than the Less Competition Model (LCM). LCM scores are calculated as follows: Total CBC Market Share \\u2013 EAAS = SP This equation treats all CBC Radio stations in a market as one outlet. In other words, average market performance in the LCM (i.e., SP = 0) represents equivalency between a market's EAAS value for one station and the combined market share of all CBC stations in that market. LCM scores are higher than MCM scores, and the actual performance of CBC Radio likely lies somewhere in between. Without some measure of competition between CBC Radio stations in a given market, the range of SP scores unfortunately cannot be resolved further. However, the LCM and MCM scores combined still form a useful metric, presenting, respectively, a best- and worst-case scenario for CBC Radio's performance. 3.4 Hypothesis Given government's resistance to establishing non-CBC PSBs in Canada (Raboy 1990, 340) and the hundreds of millions of dollars the CBC receives each year in government funding (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 2003, 177), I hypothesize that CBC Radio performs above expectations in general, producing a positive SP score in each province and year examined in this study.  3.5 Data Collection The majority of the data in this study comes from a radio listening databank released by Statistics Canada on September 18, 2008 (Statistics Canada 2008). The data set contains 20 market share information for all CBC stations in all 10 Canadian provinces from 1999-2007. This is the most recent period of data released through Statistics Canada. The data were collected by BBM in the following fashion: the ten provinces of Canada were divided into 400 non-overlapping cells whose boundaries generally follow borders previously defined by Statistics Canada, such as counties or census agglomerations (ibid.). BBM then generated the sample size for each cell required to return statistically significant data from the survey based on population estimates (ibid.). Each cell's previous response rate to past surveys determined the number of diary packages needed to achieve the required sample size of each cell (ibid.). Using computerized telephone listings and manually chosen telephone directories, BBM then compiled a listings database from which a stratified sample was taken. Then BBM's Enumeration division used computer-assisted telephone interviewing to recruit sampled households to participate in the survey (ibid.). 40.2% of the sampled households agreed to participate. These households were mailed listening diaries for each household member 12 years of age or older (ibid.). Survey participants used these diaries to document their radio listening habits over a designated survey week in quarter-hour intervals (ibid.). The survey weeks used were always in the fall months (ibid.). Once completed, the diaries were mailed back to BBM, where they were sorted, screened and amalgamated into the results eventually published by StatsCan. This sample frame excludes some Canadians from the sample population. Excluded groups include residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Indian Reserves, institutions such as prisons and hospitals, households where no member speaks English or French, and individuals without telephone service (ibid.). Since BBM is Canada's only national radio ratings measurement firm, these limitations must be accepted in order to continue the present study. 21 To determine the number of radio stations in each province for each year, I conducted a comprehensive tally through the Canadian Communication Foundation's directory of station listings. The Foundation, a registered charitable organization established by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters in 1967, maintains an authoritative directory of Canadian radio stations, including CBC stations, from the advent of broadcasting in Canada until the present day. I counted the stations in each province, accounting for closures and openings, for each year from 1999-2007 to generate the EAAS values used in this study. The directory can be viewed through www.broadcasting-history.ca. The statistical analysis and graphing in this study were done with a combination of OpenOffice and R. 22 Chapter 4: Findings 4.1 Canada The utility of Picard's approach to understanding the performance of CBC Radio is illustrated by comparing the following two graphs. Figure 4.1 is a histogram of CBC Radio's national audience share over the time period under study. The graph's mean is 10.78%, with a standard distribution of .97, a minimum of 9%, in 2005, and a maximum of 12%, in 2007. A  graph like this is less meaningful than one that compares actual performance against statistical expectations of performance. Accounting for the number of radio stations in all ten 23 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 CBC Radio National Market Share Year M ar ke t S ha re  (% ) Figure 4.1  4 provinces makes possible the generation of Figure 4.2, which depicts a very different picture of CBC Radio's national performance. The MCM scores, represented by the lower line, have a standard deviation of 1.50, a minimum of -1.35 (1999) and a maximum of 3.41 (2007). Overall, CBC Radio goes from performing below statistical expectations in this model to performing above them during the period under examination. However, the progression is not uniform, with the notable exception of a reversal in 2005, when the national SP score drops to -0.86. The SP scores have a mean of 0.61, suggesting that overall CBC Radio performs slightly above statistical expectations during the period being studied. The LCM scores show similar trends, peaking in 2007 with a score of 12.29 and bottoming out at 8.68 in 2005. The LCM scores have a standard deviation of 1.04 and a mean 24 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 National Performance of CBC Radio Year S P S co re Figure  4.2 4 of 10.6, suggesting performance above expectations. When looking at the SP scores for the entire country, the LCM is likely more meaningful than the MCM. Radio stations in other provinces do not compete with each other to the same extent as radio stations within the same province, so a model that discounts the effects of competition is likely more accurate than one that incorporates it like the MCM. There were 75 CBC stations across the provinces in 1999 and 79 in 2007. 4.2 Alberta As shown in Figure 4.3, CBC Radio's performance in Alberta differs from the national picture in several notable ways. 25 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 CBC Radio Performance in Alberta Year S P S co re Figure  4.34 The MCM SP scores in the figure are all positive except for 2005. The scores also generally decline until 2006, which has the second-highest MCM SP score, 2.08, of any MCM score on the chart. The scores are have lower spread than the national SP scores for CBC Radio, with a standard deviation of 0.88, a minimum of -0.17 (in 2005) and a maximum of 2.39 (in 2007). Though CBC Radio in Alberta produced positive SP scores over a period of negative SP scores for CBC Radio as a whole (1999 and 2000),  Alberta's mean MCM SP score of 1.16 suggests that CBC Radio there performs at least slightly above statistical expectations for the period under study. The LCM scores, with a mean of 6.87 and a standard deviation of 0.65, suggest performance above expectations. They also move differently than the MCM scores, peaking in 2000 at 7.38 and declining slightly from 2006 (7.35) to 2007 (7.07). The minimum score of 5.39 is still earned in 2005, however. There were 5 CBC Radio stations in Alberta from 1999 until 2001, and 6 thereafter. 4.3 British Columbia Figure 4.4 shows that the SP scores of CBC Radio in BC are significantly higher than national averages from the period under study. CBC Radio in BC produces such high MCM SP scores that its smallest score, 5.3 in 2005, is 1.55 times that of the highest of the national average scores, 3.41 in 2007. Figure 4.4 has relatively low spread, with a standard distribution of 1.93 under the MCM and 1.83 under the LCM. The maximum SP score under both models occurs in 2006 (11.04 for the MCM and 16.78 for the LCM). The mean MCM SP score is 8.71; over 14 times that of the equivalent national 0.61. Comparing LCM makes British Columbia's scores look slightly less impressive, though the mean of 14.74 is still higher than the national LCM SP mean of 10.6. 26 It is interesting to note that, though CBC Radio in BC still maintains comparatively high SP scores of 5.3 (MCM) and 11.34 (LCM) in the year 2005, that particular year still produces the lowest score of any in the present study. Also, unlike the national mean SP scores, which peak in 2007, CBC Radio in BC peaks in 2006 in both LCM and MCM scores. Overall, this approach suggests that CBC Radio in BC exceeds statistical expectations by a considerable margin. There were 7 CBC Radio stations in BC from 1999 to 2001, and 8 thereafter. 4.4 Manitoba Figure 4.5 demonstrates that CBC Radio in Manitoba may have performed below statistical expectations in the period under study. 27 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 CBC Radio Performance in British Columbia Year S P S co re  Figure  4.44 Manitoba's MCM SP scores have a minimum of -4.2, for 2005, and a maximum of -0.03, seen in both 2006 and 2007. The scores have a standard distribution of 1.3 and a mean value of -1.70, which is below the national MCM mean of 0.61. It is interesting to note that CBC Radio in Manitoba garnered its lowest MCM SP score in 2005, while most other provinces (as well as the national averages) garner their lowest scores in 1999. Manitoba does match the general trend of strong performance in 2006 and 2007, however, with its highest scores earned in those years. The LCM SP scores generally follow the same patterns, though of course at higher values. The scores have a mean of 7.93 and a standard deviation of 1.24. The maximum score 28 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 CBC Radio Performance in Manitoba Year S P S co re Figure 4.54 of 9.27 occurs in both 2006 ad 2007. The lowest value of 5.32 occurs in 2005, and scores generally increase in the period under examination, growing from 7.27 in 1999 to the maximum scores in 2006 and 2007. There were 4 CBC Radio stations in Manitoba in 1999 and 2000, and 5 from 2001 until 2007. 4.5 New Brunswick Figure 4.6 shows the SP scores of CBC Radio in New Brunswick from 1999 to 2007. Like the national MCM SP scores, the lowest score in New Brunswick happens in 1999. However, New Brunswick's score of -3.98 in that year is lower than the national score (- 29 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Performance in New Brunswick Year S P S co re Figure  4.64 1.35). The following year scores considerably better (though still below expectations) with a score of -1.15. Indeed, yearly MCM SP scores increase until 2002, where they reach 1.75. CBC Radio in New Brunswick generates positive MCM SP scores in 2004, 2006 and 2007, but, like the national scores, a negative score is observed in 2005: -1.84, in this case, again lower than the national score in the same year (-0.86). This changing from positive to negative MCM SP scores is frequent compared with the other provinces and the MCM SP scores of CBC Radio across the whole of Canada. The MCM SP scores have a maximum of 2.07 (2004), a minimum of -3.98 (1999), and a standard deviation of 2.09. Their mean is 0.05. The LCM SP scores do not show the same growth as the MCM SP scores between 1999 and 2002, but they do generally indicate performance above expectations, with a mean of 11.81. The scores have a minimum of 8.36, earned in 2005 like most minimum SP scores in this study. The maximum value of 13.56 comes in 2000. The LCM SP scores have a standard distribution of 1.62. Overall, the MCM and LCM SP scores suggest that CBC Radio in New Brunswick performance generally exceeded expectations between 1999 and 2007. There were six CBC Radio stations in New Brunswick during the period under study. 4.6 Newfoundland and Labrador Figure 4.7 shows that CBC Radio Newfoundland and Labrador garnered negative MCM SP scores for the whole period examined in the present study. The scores follow the general trend of low values in 1999 and 2005, with scores of -13.24 and -17.83 in those respective years. It is interesting to note that, unlike the national scores, those of CBC Radio in Newfoundland and Labrador show relatively little increase between 1999 and 2007, starting at -13.24 and finishing at -11.73. This represents a change in SP score of 1.51, which 30 is 31.6 percent of the difference in the national scores of the same period (CBC Radio's national MCM SP score increases by 4.76 between 1999 and 2007). Overall, the scores have a minimum of -17.83 (in 2005), a maximum -10.24 (in 2001), a standard distribution of 2.3. The mean MCM SP score of -12.54 suggests that CBC Radio in Newfoundland and Labrador performs below statistical expectations in the period studied. The LCM SP scores move in a similar pattern, though at higher values. They have a mean of 7.86, a maximum of 10.45  (2001), a minimum of 2.17 (2005), and a standard distribution of 2.55. This suggests performance above expectations, albeit by a smaller margin than most other provinces. 31 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Performance in Newfoundland and Labrador Year S P S co re Figure  4.7 4 Since the LCM and MCM scores together describe the possible range of CBC Radio's performance against statistical expectations, the scores in Figure 4.7 present the possibility that CBC Radio is performing above or below expectations in Newfoundland and Labrador. The true performance likely lies somewhere between the two bounds, suggesting performance marginally above or below expectations. There were seven CBC Radio stations in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1999 and 2007. 4.7 Nova Scotia As Figure 4.8 shows, CBC Radio in Nova Scotia garnered positive MCM SP scores between 1999 and 2007 with the exception of 2005. The scores have a minimum of -1.61 (in 2005), a maximum of 3.74 (in 2006), and a standard distribution of 1.67. The scores also decrease relatively drastically from 2006 to 2007, going from 3.74 to 1.28 \\u2013 not much higher than the 1999 SP score of 1.18. This is atypical compared to other MCM SP scores at both the provincial and especially national level, where it grows from 2.24 to 3.41 in the same period. Overall, the mean MCM score of 1.69 suggests that CBC Radio in Nova Scotia performs above expectations for the period examined in the present study. Since this score represents a worst-case scenario, it seems likely that CBC Radio in Nova Scotia performs above expectations on average. The LCM SP scores, unsurprisingly, follow a similar pattern with higher values. The LCM SP standard distribution is 1.92, while the maximum score of 10.45 occurs in 2001. The minimum LCM SP score of 9.2 occurs in the same year as the minimum MCM score, 2005. The LCM SP mean of 13.26 suggests performance above expectations. There were five CBC Radio stations in Nova Scotia between 1999 and 2007. 32 4.8 Ontario As Figure 4.9 shows, Ontario garnered positive MCM SP scores in every year examined in the present study. The MCM SP scores also generally increase, with the second lowest score of 1.42 occurring in 1999 and the maximum score of 5.22 coming in 2007. This latter score is 3.68 times the size of the former. The minimum score, 0.35, was garnered in 2005. The scores have a standard distribution of 1.39 and a mean of 2.79. These scores suggest that CBC Radio in Ontario performed above statistical expectations between 1999 and 2007. 33 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -5 0 5 10 15 20 CBC Radio Performance in Nova Scotia Year S P S co re Figure  4.84 The LCM SP scores suggest performance above expectations by a greater margin. The maximum score of 10.43 occurs in 2007, the minimum of 6.20 in 2005. The scores have a standard distribution of 1.17 and a mean of 8.85. The positive means of both the LCM and MCM SP scores suggests that CBC Radio in Ontario performed above on average expectations during the period under study. There were 15 CBC Radio stations in Ontario during the period examined. 4.9 Prince Edward Island As Figure 4.10 shows, CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island garnered negative MCM SP scores in every year examined in this study. The minimum score is -23.73, coming in 34 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 CBC Radio Performance in Ontario Year S P S co re Figure  4.94 2005, and the maximum is -8.23, garnered in 2006 \\u2013 interestingly, one year after the minimum score. The SP scores also increase overall by 5.06, from -16.23 in 1999 to -11.17 in 2007. CBC Radio's SP scores in Prince Edward Island have a standard distribution of 4.92, the largest of any of the provinces. The mean MCM SP score of -15.09 is the lowest of any province. The mean LCM SP score of 1.04 is also the lowest of any province. Prince Edward Island's LCM SP scores also have a comparatively large spread, with a standard distribution of 4.91. The lowest score of -7.07 occurs in 2005, while the maximum score of 8.43 in 2000. Negative scores are earned in 2001, 2005 and 2006. Since LCM SP scores represent a best-case scenario of performance, these scores suggest that CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island performed below expectations in 2001, 35 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -25 -22.5 -20 -17.5 -15 -12.5 -10 -7.5 -5 -2.5 0 2.5 5 7.5 10 CBC Radio Performance in Prince Edward Island Year S P  S co re Figure  4.104 2005 and 2006, and may have performed below expectations in other years as well (e.g., 1999 has an LCM SP score of 0.43). There were 2 CBC Radio stations in Prince Edward Island between 1999 and 2007. 4.10 Quebec Figure 4.11 demonstrates that CBC Radio's MCM SP scores in Quebec go from negative to positive the time period studied. The minimum score, -3.19, occurs in 1999, while the maximum score of 4.50 occurs in 2007. With the exception of 2004, when the score remained the same as the previous year at 0.49, MCM SP scores increase every year \\u2013 even in 2005, when the MC SP score of every other province's CBC Radio stations decreased. The scores have a standard distribution of 2.57. The LCM SP scores show the now-familiar similar patterns at higher values. The scores have a mean of 9.83, a standard distribution of 2.29, a maximum of 13.88 and a minimum of 6.88.  The maximum and minimum scores occur in the same years as the equivalent MCM SP scores, 2007 and 1999, respectively. As will be discussed later in this study, the SP scores of CBC Radio in Quebec in 2005 is somewhat unusual. The scores of CBC Radio in every other province went down in that year. One explanation that immediately suggests itself is that the higher number of French-language (Radio-Canada) stations in Quebec compared with the rest of Canada might have played a role. It may well be that French-speaking audiences behave differently than English-speaking ones in this context. Future audience research might investigate the possibility. Another explanation is that English-speaking programming changed in some fashion detrimental to maintaining market-share. A carefully-done content analysis could test such a hypothesis. Another possible cause might involve the labour dispute of 2005, which saw most CBC employees outside of Quebec cease work for seven weeks and one day 36 (Ferguson 2007, 182). It is beyond the scope of the present study to investigate the resiliency of CBC Radio in Quebec in 2005, but it certainly warrants future research. It is interesting to note that CBC Radio in Quebec's mean MCM SP score is nonetheless still negative, at -0.26. This suggests that overall, CBC Radio in Quebec may have performed below statistical expectations during some of the years examined by the present study. There were 15 CBC Radio stations in Quebec in 1999 and 2000, and 16 from 2001 onwards. 37 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Performance In Quebec Year S P S co re Figure  4.114 4.11 Saskatchewan Figure 4.12 illustrates that CBC Radio generally garnered positive MCM SP scores between 1999 and 2007. Figure 4.12's minimum MC SP score and only negative value, -1.00, comes in 2005. The maximum of 2.79 occurs in 2007. Saskatchewan's MCM SP scores have a standard distribution of 1.05, the second smallest standard distribution of any province in this study. The mean MCM SP score of Figure 4.12 is 1.03. The LCM SP scores have a mean of of 8.32 and a standard distribution of 1.24. The maximum score of 9.47 comes in 1999, while the minimum of 5.53 comes in 2005. 38 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 CBC Radio Performance in Saskatchewan Year S P S co re Figure  4.124 Overall, this suggests that CBC Radio in Saskatchewan performed above statistical expectations between 1999 and 2007. There were 4 CBC Radio stations in Saskatchewan between 1999 and 2007. 39 Chapter 5: Conclusion The results of this study shed some interesting light on CBC Radio's performance across Canada between 1999 and 2007. The findings suggest that CBC Radio performance against statistical expectations varies significantly between provinces and over time. The national mean MCM SP score of 0.61 suggests that CBC Radio generally performs at least slightly above expectations, while the LCM mean of 10.6 suggests it does so by a significantly wider margin. However, this macroscopic view of MCM scores resolves to a somewhat different outlook when one moves past the national perspective to examine the provinces, as Figure 5.1 illustrates. 40 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Provincial MCM Scores Year M C M  S P Sc or es Figure  5.14 The two lines along the bottom are Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, while the line along the top is British Columbia. The seven other provinces cluster in the middle, generally between -5 and 5. Between the seven middle provinces, the range between the MCM scores is biggest in 2001, at 6.08, and smallest in 2006, at 3.99. Their collective mean increases year-over-year from 1999 to 2007, with the exception of 2005, where it dips from its preceding score of 1.26 to -1.05. Ontario has the highest score in every year except 2002, when Nova Scotia leads with 3.55, and 2005, when Quebec leads with 1.14. 41 The MCM SP scores, examined in isolation, suggest that CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland perform markedly worse than in the rest of the country, while its performance in British Columbia exceeds expectations by a considerable margin. The LCM SP scores viewed together produce a different picture, as illustrated by Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2 has the same legend as Figure 5.1 \\u2013 Prince Edward Island's scores form the green line along the bottom, while British Columbia's form the orange line along the top. It is interesting to compare the position of Nova Scotia's scores, represented by the navy line, in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2. While its MCM SP scores place it with those of most other provinces, its LCM SP scores are the highest in the period studied in 1999 (13.68), 2000 (14.68) and 2002 (15.67). Newfoundland's scores, represented by the yellow line, jump into the middle of the pack. Though Prince Edward Island's scores remain markedly more 42 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 CBC Radio Provincial LCM Scores Year S P S co re s Figure  5.24 negative than the other provinces (excepting 2004, when it peaks at 8.43), the LCM SP scores overall have a smaller spread than MCM SP scores, as indicated by their smaller average range (10.86 to 14.12). Given the differences between the two sets of scores, it is useful to examine the picture produced by their means. Figure 5.3 does this. Figure 5.3 presents a more coherent picture of CBC Radio's performance, though a less reliable one. It represents the mean of the MCM and LCM SP scores. British Columbia's scores remain the highest while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland's scores are still the lowest, but by smaller margins than in the MCM graphs. The combined scores have a mean 43 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 CBC Radio Combined Provincial SP Scores MCM and LCM scores combined Year S P S co re s Figure 5.34 of 3.82, a maximum of 13.91 (British Columbia in 2006) and a minimum of -15.4 (Prince Edward Island in 2005). Figure 5.3 represents the middle ground between the upper and lower bounds on CBC Radio's performance established by the MCM and LCM scores. There is no greater likelihood of the Corporation's actual performance corresponding to these values than to the MCM or LCM scores, or any other value between them.  It is important to keep this in mind when looking at the means. They are a useful illustration of CBC Radio's performance, but by no means are they authoritative. Beyond comparing SP scores across geography, it is interesting to examine the scores on a chronological basis. 5.1 The Influence of 2005 The year 2005 saw a dip in SP scores for CBC Radio in every province across the country, with the exception of Quebec. The national aggregate MCM mean fell 1.88, from 1.02 in 2004 to -0.86 in 2005. The LCM mean dropped 2.29 to 8.68 in 2005 \\u2013 the only year- over-year decrease between 1999 and 2007 excepting the 0.10 contraction seen between 2003 and 2004. Prince Edward Island suffered by far the biggest decreases. Its MCM SP score fell from -8.23 in 2004 to -1.61 in 2005, while its LCM score dropped from 8.43 to -7.07. British Columbia and Nova Scotia also suffered relatively drastic reductions of 4.59 and 4.43, respectively, in their MCM scores. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland's LCM scores all dipped by approximately 5. The mean reduction among provinces was 4.13 and 4.42 for MCM and LCM scores, respectively. Only Quebec managed to increase its scores, going from 0.49  to 1.14 in MCM and 10.95 to 11.25 in LCM from 2004 to 2005. The influence of this unusual year is demonstrated in Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5. 44 Ignoring 2005, as Figure 5.5 does, makes CBC Radio's national performance look more linear. It also improves the overall performance of CBC Radio nationally, bumping the MCM SP mean up to 0.79 from 0.61 and the LCM SP mean from 10.60 to 10.84. The reasons for this decline in 2005 are not immediately apparent. While some 32 new radio stations began broadcasting in 2005, increased competition seems an unlikely explanation, given that new stations opened up throughout the period under examination at an average of 25 per year. 32 is above this average, it is true, but the largest year-on-year increase of 35 occurs from 2006 to 2007, and in that period CBC Radio's national SP scores go up by 1.17 (MCM) and 0.80 (LCM) in that same time. Further, no CBC stations opened or closed in Canada from from 2003 to 2007.

One possible explanation lies in the CBC labour disputes in August of that year. Thousands of CBC employees, including almost the entire production staff of every radio and television program outside of Moncton, New Brunswick and the province of Quebec, went on strike for almost two months (Ferguson 2007, 181-182). The lockout inspired spirited debate about public service broadcasting in Canada (see Ferguson 2007), but the lack of new programming produced by the CBC may have sent its audience elsewhere. That the lockout overlapped with the sampling period used by BBM to collect that data this study makes use of (see section 3.5) may have exacerbated the decline in SP scores. On the other hand, this study only examines CBC Radio's audience performance, not what it actually broadcasts. Quality of programming presumably carries some weight in 46 Figure 5.54 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2006 2007 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 National Performance of CBC Radio 2005 Removed Year S P S co re determining a broadcaster's market-share. One might examine CBC Radio's programming to determine if it changed in some substantive fashion in 2005. Conversely, it may be that audience tastes and expectations changed in that year and CBC Radio's programming did not. Future research could investigate these hypotheses to further our understanding the CBC and media markets more generally. 5.2 The Scores In Context Since assessing a media outlet's performance using the method developed by Picard and deployed in this study is a comparatively new way of measuring media function, comparing the SP scores generated in this study to those of other research papers is difficult. Still, one of the advantages of Picard's approach is that the scores it generates provide some insight in and of themselves. SP scores are, to an extent, meaningful on their own. The MCM and LCM SP scores for CBC Radio between 1999 and 2007 paint a variable picture of the state of the Corporation's health across Canada during this period. CBC Radio stations in British Columbia outperform stations elsewhere by a significant margin. In contrast, the stations in Prince Edward Island perform below those in other provinces by a substantial margin. As illustrated by Figure 5.2, the stations in the other seven provinces generate scores much closer together, with a maximum of MCM SP of 5.22 (Ontario in 2007), a minimum of -4.2 (Manitoba in 2005) and a mean of 0.68. The LCM SP scores peak at 16.78 in British Columbia in 2007 while their minimum comes from Prince Edward Island in 2005 (-7.07). MCM SP scores in 2007 generally suggest an upward trend in the more recent years covered in the present study. Exceptions to this are Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, where scores decreased, and Manitoba, where the score remained the same as the previous year. The mean MCM SP score for all 10 provinces certainly suggests an upward trend in the 47 last three years of the examined period, rising from -0.86 in 2005 to 2.24 in 2006 and 3.41 in 2007 (see Figure 4.1). The LCM SP scores for the last three years of the study suggest less coherent movement. Prince Edward Island's scores improve, jumping from -7.07 in 2005 to -2.69 in 2006 to 3.11 in 2007. Scores in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland also show consistent growth from 2005 to 2007. Saskatchewan, in contrast, has variable scores, growing from 5.53 in 2005 to 9.17 in 2006, but then shrinking to 7.47 in 2007. Still, average change from 2006 to 2007, is 0.59 \\u2013 a positive value, possibly indicating future growth.  New research done with more recent market share data and radio station counts would be able to speak more to the duration and extent of a potential upward swing in SP scores for CBC Radio. Further research could also be done to better explain the unusual performance of CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island over the period studied here. As previously noted, CBC Radio there performs notably worse than it does compared to other provinces or to Canada as a whole. Perhaps this is attributable to the relatively small number of total stations in the province \\u2013 there were six until 2005 when the total changed to seven. The average number of stations per province in a given year for this study is 76.9, and the province with the least stations outside of Prince Edward Island is Newfoundland and Labrador, which had 30 in 2007. Or, alternately, perhaps the population demographics of the Island are different from those of the other provinces in some fashion. It is also possible that CBC Radio might have trouble attracting the same quality of personnel to work for it there. These are tentative hypotheses that could be tested with more research to explain the sub-standard performance of CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island between 1999 and 2007. The national mean MCM score of 0.61 does suggest that this study's hypothesis that CBC Radio's performance would exceed expectations by a substantial margin is disproved. 48 MCM scores represent a lower bound of sorts on possible performance; it is entirely possible that a given station or group of stations performs at their MCM SP scores. Therefore, the national MCM mean of 0.61 means that this study's hypothesis (that CBC Radio performed above expectations by a wide margin in every year) is rejected. One avenue of comparison for this study's results that suggests itself is Picard's original study. Examining market data from 1999, a time of increasing competition in broadcasting (Picard 2002a, 227), Picard found European television PSBs produced a wide value of Channel Performance scores, from the mid-30 scores of Denmark and Germany to Belgium's -11.4 (ibid., 233). The scores have a mean of 18.45 when certain overlapping values are removed (e.g. the score for Ireland that ignores the role of PSB from the United Kingdom) (calculated from ibid.). Picard also provides table of market position, illustrating that all but two of the PSBs he studies lead their markets (ibid., 234). The performance of CBC Radio as measured in this study does not quite measure up with Picard's results. Comparing his scores with the LCM scores generated in this study makes sense because they are generated with the same calculations. The national mean LCM score (10.60) is 7.85 points below the mean for European PSBs, though CBC's lowest score (-7.07, earned by Prince Edward Island in 2005) is 4.33 points higher than the minimum score in Picard's study (-11.4, earned by Belgian PSBs operating in France) (ibid., 233). This suggests that CBC Radio is performing at a lower level than European PSBs, and may need to consider methods of improving its market share. Explaining this difference could be done by future research. The histories and ages of the two industries may mean that radio is more mature and competitive, or that radio audiences behave differently than television ones. There might be a qualitative difference between the content produced by the various broadcasters in question that could help explain the differences. Or perhaps the broadcast content is largely similar and the audiences tastes differ. Alternately, the non-PSB stations in 49 the European markets may be less competitive with PSBs than their radio equivalents are in Canada. More research could further compare the Canadian and European media markets to better describe and understand where they overlap, as well as how and where they differ. The conclusion that CBC Radio is performing at a lower level than European PSBs rests on the assumption that this study presents an accurate performance of CBC Radio between 1999 and 2007. Future research could focus on establishing this with more rigor and certainty in a number of ways. First, more recent market share and radio station count data could be used to examine the performance of CBC Radio in the years since 2007. Studying past periods would also be useful for providing a sense of context and history for CBC Radio's performance. Both types of research could also be done in a more chronologically detailed way, such as examining performance on a month-by-month basis (though this would require more frequent, and thus more expensive and time-consuming, audience surveys). Second, the geographic parsing of results employed in this study could be further broken down. Examining CBC Radio's performance on a city-by-city basis, or, ideally, a station-by- station basis, would provide further findings of interest and a more nuanced portrait of the Corporation's overall performance. 5.3 Interpreting the Findings This research sheds some light on CBC Radio's performance in recent years, and attempts to address a small part of a research gap in Canadian communication literature. The theoretical framework outlined earlier in this study helps make further sense of the numbers produced by this study's quantitative analysis. CBC Radio's national MCM SP mean score of 0.61 over the period studied suggests that the radio division of Canada's only national PSB may not be exceeding expected average performance by any great measure. 50 For CBC Radio, this research presents a challenge. This analysis suggests that its performance across Canada between 1999 and 2007 may have been below expectations in some provinces, particularly Prince Edward Island. The PSB's performance in 2005, as measured through this analysis, also declines markedly. On the other hand, CBC Radio's continued success in British Columbia could be counted as a cause for celebration. This study suggests that CBC Radio should be actively trying to increase its market share across Canada. However, it does indicate a positive trend in the national mean SP score's last few years; possibly, this trend will continue. The scholarly implications of this research highlight the differences between public service broadcasting in Canada and Europe. Picard, examining European PSBs, found that most of them (e.g. those in Denmark, Italy, Germany, France, Finland, etc.) exceed performance by a substantial margin (Picard 2002a, 233). The results of this study present a somewhat different picture of the performance of one part of Canada's most prominent PSB. Clearly, broadcasting markets behave differently in Canada and warrant their own study. Comparative research with other media markets could further illustrate the influence of national context on the performance of pubic service broadcasting. From a policy standpoint, this study is useful because it weighs the performance of CBC Radio against what can reasonably be expected of it. This helps to identify areas of performance above and below statistical expectations, which in turn could influence policy and research considerations. For example, a future content analysis could compare the practices of CBC Radio in British Columbia and Prince Edward Island to determine if differences in broadcast content contribute to the marked difference in performance. This research could also be paired with funding information to investigate the possibility of a relationship between finance structure and performance against expectations. This study provides a more meaningful measure of CBC Radio's market performance between 1999 and 51 2007 than traditional market-share measures, and therefore its findings are relevant to any policy that refers to the health of public service broadcasting in Canada in these years. It is important to be mindful that market share is far from the only measure of a PSB's success \\u2013 it makes little sense to focus only on market performance while neglecting to consider the actual content being broadcast and how that content is produced. Eaman's critique presents an important limitation to the present study: understanding CBC ratings in a more meaningful fashion does not necessarily lead to a greater understanding of the CBC's influence on Canada, and nor does it directly correlate with the health of public service broadcasting in Canada (Eaman 1994). However, the market share of the CBC is still a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition for the success of public service broadcasting. This study is not a content analysis, but an assessment of the delivery of a public service. Such research is only worthwhile if the service in question is itself important. However, market share is still a metric of some influence, and this study suggests that CBC Radio may fail to measure up to it in some respects. Further research is required ascertain the extent and character of this failure, but this study indicates that between 1999 and 2007, CBC Radio faced significant challenges in some provinces to fulfilling its task of fostering national cohesion and collective identity across Canada. 52 Bibliography Anderson, R.

Sc., The University of Ottawa 2003     THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF  MASTER OF JOURNALISM   in   The Faculty of Graduate Studies  (Journalism)    THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (Vancouver)   April 2010  \\u00a9 Rebecca teBrake, 2010   ii ABSTRACT As political engagement declines in Western democracies, the Internet has been held up as a promising site for citizen participation and engagement. This optimism has been fuelled by recent political events that seem to confirm the Internet's democratic potential. Barack Obama channelled the Internet's power for fundraising and voter mobilization in the 2009 U.S. election. Likewise, Iranian voters successfully used social media such as Twitter to organize protests of the country's 2009 presidential election. This paper presents a first look at how Canadian political parties are using and responding to online communication tools during elections campaigns. Specifically it examines the role of online communications tools in building and developing a campaign platform. Moreover, it discusses whether these activities represent a shift towards a strengthened democracy or are simply reflective of current political culture. The findings are based on data gathered through semi-structured interviews with political strategists involved in the 2008-09 federal, British Columbia provincial and Vancouver municipal elections. This study found that online communication during election campaigns has little influence on the shape of the policy platform. However, political parties have been quick to adopt new online communications platforms allowing them to market their candidates and policies. Moreover, the Internet has shaped traditional campaign functions allowing parties to recruit funds, voter information and volunteers online. Rather than fundamentally shifting the character of democracy in Canada, the current use of online communication tools seems to be defined by the existing political culture.     iii TABLE OF CONTENTS ABSTRACT ......................................................................................................................

INTRODUCTION The Internet has opened a new and seemingly endless space for citizens to voice their opinions, express dissent or show support for politicians, government and public policy. The role of technology in political mobilization has enhanced democratic engagement in a number of recent elections globally. Barack Obama\\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign encouraged widespread democratic involvement using the Internet. His website helped to organize 150,000 events and raise $600 million in campaign donations (Stirland 1). The Internet appeared to move the campaign beyond political elites and traditional media allowing the average American voter a voice in the debate. As Simon Rosenberg, president of a political think tank suggested, \\u201c[Obama\\u2019s] run a campaign where he\\u2019s used very modern tools, spoke to a new coalition, talked about new issues, and along the way, he\\u2019s reinvented the way campaigns are run\\u201d (Stirland 2008). The democratic power of the Internet was also on full display in the aftermath of the last Iranian presidential election. Twitter was used as a means to send messages about the political situation to the outside world and to organize protests and political action inside Iran (Lev Grossman 1). These examples raise an important research question: what is the relationship between online communication and political action in Canada?  This study seeks to examine a small part of this question, focusing on the role of online communication in election campaigns. My research examines the impact of new media forms on the political agenda focusing on the role of interactive online information in the 2008 Canadian federal and Vancouver municipal election and the 2009 British Columbia provincial election. I am particularly interested in the role of interactive online communication and journalism (i.e.   2 Twitter, Facebook, blogs and online forums) in developing and communicating campaign platforms. This research is important because while the Internet has become a site of political mobilization and expression in recent elections, media studies literature on the role of online communication and journalism in Canadian elections is underdeveloped despite the high levels of Internet use in this country (Fletcher and Zamaria 17). The Canadian attitude towards Internet empowerment does not resonate with recent real world events and thus warrants further investigation. According to the Canadian Internet Project\\u2019s 2007 survey, 54 per cent of Canadian homes have broadband access and 88 per cent of Canadians 12 years or older have been online (Fletcher and Zamaria 5,8). Canadians spend an average of 15 hours online each week and use the Internet for a variety of purposes including email, entertainment, information seeking, social networking and news reading (Fletcher and Zamaria 5). Over 40 per cent of Canadian Internet-users have visited a community or social- networking site (Fletcher and Zamaria 14), which have been catalysts for political action in other countries. Moreover, news sites are among the most popular online destinations with 79 per cent of Internet-users going online to look for news (Fletcher and Zamaria 12). Media and political marketing strategists provide glimpses of the impact of Internet mobilization on Canadian democracy. For example, in a 2009 Toronto Star article, Alexandre Sevigny, a communication professor at McMaster University, attributes the eventual inclusion of Elizabeth May, the leader of the federal Green Party, in the 2008 leaders\\u2019 debate to pressure from MySpace users. Sevigny asserts that Internet pressure forced St\\u00e9phane Dion to stand up for May and led to her inclusion in the debate (Diebel 1). A 2009 political communications industry study surveyed parliamentarians and asked them about how they use and respond to online communication and the grassroots campaigns that employ them. Their initial findings were that MPs are not well positioned to develop online relationships and use the web tools for politics (Meyers, Nanos and Thompson 1).   3 Other studies have shown Canadians are sceptical about empowerment and the Internet. The Canadian Internet Project found that online civic engagement is low with fewer than one in five people using the Internet to communicate with an elected official or civil servant (Fletcher and Zamaria 15). According to the project\\u2019s findings, \\u201cCanadians are not convinced of the empowerment potential of the Internet; only one in four thinks the Internet can give them more political power or influence the government\\u201d (Fletcher and Zamaria 16). While overall Canadians are unconvinced of the Internet\\u2019s role in facilitating political action, there are small subsections of the population who are increasing their online civic engagement, specifically francophones and females (Fletcher and Zamaria 16). So just how is the Internet used in Canadian elections and what are the implications for democracy. My research seeks to take a first step towards answering this question by examining the use of online media in three of the most recent Canadian election campaigns. By studying how political strategists used interactive online communication and journalism in the 2008-09 federal, provincial and municipal election campaigns, my research seeks to uncover the impact of online communication tools on the development and communication of political campaign platforms. I will build on recent studies and theoretical expositions of the power of digital media to create political action. This work will just be a small snapshot of the role that online political mobilization has in the Canadian context at one particular point in history, but it seeks to establish a pilot for academic inquiry into future campaigns. This research also fits into an important academic debate about the role online communication plays in creating political action. It is to this debate this paper now turns.   4 2. LITERATURE REVIEW My research is situated within a larger body of literature that seeks to explore a related set of conceptual themes and relationships. Most broadly, this work seeks to examine whether the Internet changes politics, whether political culture is reflected online or whether the relationship is more complex. Thus, my study is situated in the debate between technological determinists and social determinists, which will be discussed subsequently. More specifically, my research raises questions about the existence of enhanced opportunities for citizens to influence policy and better make their will known to politicians during election campaigns as a result of online communication tools. The next section will examine empirical studies about how politicians have been influenced by and are employing these new tools. Specifically, it will examine recent empirical studies on the Internet\\u2019s role during election campaigns and then move on to consider the theories, technological and social determinism, that inform the field. More nuanced approaches to the role of the Internet in political campaigns will also be considered including theories of networking and agenda setting. It will conclude with a consideration of the role of the campaign itself in developing in policymaking and communications. 2.1 The Role of Online Communications in Elections Literature The rising power of the Internet in recent elections in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom has prompted empirical studies that examine how online political tools have been used during elections and their impact on political engagement. Some studies from the political communication and political science literatures (Panagopoulos and Bergan 2009, Dale and Strauss 2009, Cornfield and Kaye 2009) have demonstrated that political parties are using the Internet as an extension of traditional campaign tools. For example, Panagopoulos   5 and Bergan conclude that the Internet has become essential for fundraising, with presidential hopeful John Kerry raising $82 million in 2003 and presidential incumbent George W. Bush eliciting $13 million (Panagopoulos and Bergan 128). The researchers also found that these fundraising acts are likely to be accompanied by other political action. \\u201cOnline donors take on average one additional action on the activism scale (134).\\u201d The conclusions of the previously cited studies are broadly that the Internet helps parties connect with voters in ways that mirror traditional campaign functions such as fundraising, advertising, eliciting new memberships, volunteer recruitment, getting out the vote and disseminating messages. Other studies (Gueorguieva 2009, Slotnick 2009, Williams and Gulati 2009) focus on the political adoption of social media such as Facebook, MySpace and YouTube. These studies show politicians use social media sites for political advertising and for extending the reach of political messaging through networks. The literature demonstrates that politicians recognize the potential to reach formerly unreachable voters through online networks, a new application of the old campaign practice of meeting and greeting. Williams and Gulati find a correlation between the number of friends a candidate has on Facebook and the final electoral outcome (279). They hypothesize the relationship reflects the success of the grassroots campaign (Williams and Gulati 286). Gueorguieva asserts that YouTube has fundamentally changed the communicative style of politicians forcing them to appear more natural and honest (241). As Gueorguieva states, \\u201cThe advent of YouTube changed the way politicians communicate with voters. Political analysts predict that YouTube will force candidates to be more natural, direct and honest, since they might be filmed anywhere and anytime\\u2026\\u201d (241). Yet, despite a growing online presence, some scholars have concluded that message control still defines every way politicians use the Internet (Panagopolous 13, Kifer, Druckman and Parkin 41). In the Canadian context, Peter Smith and Peter Chen assessed the online presence of political parties in the 2008 federal election. Smith and Chen argue that online tools are   6 adopted when there are few barriers (12). In contradiction to Williams and Gulati, the researchers find that the number of friends politicians have online does not translate into votes (13). Instead, they conclude that due to their minimal presence on social networks candidates do not see social networking as the best investment (Smith and Chen 13). If candidates saw social networking services as a useful means to access different constituencies online\\u2026it would be reasonable to expect candidates would employ large numbers of social networking profiles\\u2026..[however] there is no relationship between candidates\\u2019 use of social networking services and their market share, indicating that use of these services tended towards symbolic association with the channel, rather than seeing specific benefit in the communities represented in these services\\u201d (Smith and Chen 13).  Canadian politicians also demonstrate a preference for traditional campaign tools such as face-to-face communication, but have a growing appreciation for online tools especially websites (Smith and Chen 17). While Smith and Chen provide an exceptional baseline assessment of which tools political parties used, they do not say whether the online presence of political parties impacted policy decisions, nor did they assess if politicians actually engaged with voters online. Hun Myoung Park and James L. Perry find that an online presence could have an impact on campaign outcomes. Citizens who read websites are 20 per cent more likely to send an email urging other people to vote, 10 per cent more likely to attend a rally and 11.2 per cent more likely to give money to a candidate (Park and Perry 108-114). A similar relationship was found to be true for online donors in another study (Panagopoulos and Bergan 2009:134). The researchers do not however explain the mechanics of this relationship.  There is less evidence in the literature that the online presence of politicians has created a two-way dialogue that lead to changes in the policy agenda. Steven Schneider and Kirsten Foot\\u2019s assessment of the 2000 and 2004 American presidential elections demonstrates that the online activities of political parties did a good job of informing, but were   7 not successful in truly connecting or mobilizing (27). Other scholars examined blogs with a similar conclusion. Roland Abold\\u2019s study of citizen weblogs in the 2005 German election argues that in a post-modern campaign politicians need to target specific groups and blogs can help achieve that goal (211). Theoretically, Abold is optimistic about the democratic potential of blogs arguing that they dismantle barriers to political discussion and break open the public agenda (214). However, Abold\\u2019s research, based on survey research, concludes differently. Respondents reported that weblogs have minimal effect; only 25 per cent believed blogs were credible and 18 per cent believed they influenced public opinion (Abold 229). Abold concludes that weblogs only attract people who are already politically involved and have little impact on opening up debate (230).  One thing that is empirically clear is that web campaigning is now central to elections in Western democracies. As Schneider and Foot state, \\u201cWeb campaigning moved from the exotic and exploratory fringes of the electoral arena to its very core (190).\\u201d Based on their extensive study of American elections, Schneider and Foot believe the online sphere provides more opportunities for political action and fundamentally changes how politicians and citizens perceive themselves and their role in democracy\\u2014a suggestion that taps into larger questions about the impact of technology on culture and democracy which will now be discussed. 2.2 The Internet: Revolutionary Force or Reinforcing Power? 2.2.1 Revolutionary Force: Technological Determinism While this study is focused on a narrow question related to the relationship between online communication and the development and communication of the campaign platform, the overarching aim of this research is rooted larger debates about the relationship between the media, information technology and democracy. The Internet has many characteristics that elicit scholarly optimism. It is interactive, instant and interconnected. It has the power to allow direct communication enabling citizens   8 to set the public agenda and demand the attention of politicians. The Internet was also seen as a tool to provide voters with pertinent information and give them a space to act. In short, optimists suggest technological advances would lead to advanced democracy. The view that technology drives social and political change is called technological determinism and set its theoretical roots long before the development of the worldwide web. Media theorist Marshall McLuhan is likely the best-known technological determinist. Claiming that the medium is the message, McLuhan argued information technology drove human development. He posited that electronic media created a global village, fundamentally changing the way we do things (Littlejohn 267). Quoting McLuhan, Stephen Littlejohn states: \\u201c[Media] is forcing us to reconsider and re-evaluate practically every thought, every action and every institution formerly taken for granted\\u2026.They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered.\\u201d (Littlejohn 267-268). McLuhan died before the Internet took hold, but scholar Paul Levinson pushed the theory into the digital age. Levinson asserts moving content online has a profound democratizing consequences. Unlike our experience with books, newspapers, and magazines, which for all but a tiny fraction of the population has been a one-way engagement of reading, not writing; the online experience is two-way, allowing readers to contribute via email, bulletin board discussion and all the manner of annotation as they navigate the web\\u2026Indeed, with the exception of the telegraph and the telephone, whose content was always written or spoke by its users, the Internet and its tributaries reverse the trajectory of a handful of messages to a legion of passive users that has typified all technological media since the printing press (38).  For technological determinists, the Internet presents a new form of media that has the capacity to fundamentally change the way citizens interact and how they form their social and political structures. It puts citizens back into control. McLuhan\\u2019s mentor, Canadian media theorist Harold Innis, was one of the founding thinkers about the emanicpatory power of the media\\u2014the same emancipatory power that has excited technological optimists. Innis\\u2019 Empire and Communications demonstrates that empires are propped up by monopolies of knowledge (Littlejohn 266). That is the powerful in   9 society control access to and the distribution of knowledge. As new media technologies like the printing press come onto the scene and change access to knowledge they challenge this power (Littlejohn 266). Building on Innis\\u2019 theories, technology optimists assert the Internet causes a fundamental shift in the production and distribution of knowledge forcing change in the political loci of power. As an expression of this optimism, John Barlow wrote \\u201cA Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\\u201d in 1996. The treatise asserts the freedom of online expression for all societal groups, regardless of race, class or values, without government interference, stating, \\u201cI declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us\\u201d (Barlow 1). This treatise expresses the idea that the technology has power against social and political forces, an ironic assertion considering the Internet was designed as a tool for intra-government communications. Some scholars have applied the frame of technological determinism to recent political developments. In their book Millennial Makeover, Moreley Winograd and Michael D. Hais argue the character of the Internet, coupled with a web-savvy, networked generation will create a political realignment in the United States. The authors assess the technological developments adopted into the everyday lives of the new generation including peer-to-peer and networked technologies and assert the ability of these technologies to connect people, share information and allow every citizen to be a producer of information would play an important role in political realignment (Winograd and Hais 152). The authors assert this new world will undercut former political institutions such as traditional media and the primacy of fund-raising and allow every citizen to disseminate his or her own ideas (Winograd and Hais 154). Contrary to technological determinists, other scholars suggest the relationship between technology and political change is too simplistic and flows in the wrong direction, a theoretical proposition to which I now turn.   10 2.2.2 Reinforcing Power: Social Determinism Social determinists are more sceptical about the Internet\\u2019s potential for greater citizen impact on the political action and public policy. Theorists such as Lelia Green (2001) invert the relationship set out by technological determinists. For Green, technology is the dependent variable. Society is responsible for the adoption and implementation of new technologies (Green 3). Class, race, gender create power imbalances that impact the ways in which new technologies are used (Green 5). Instead of levelling the playing field, social determinists would assert \\u201ctechnologies express the priorities of those who champion them\\u201d (Green 6). This perspective allows for positive changes if people are interested and involved in using technology to advance values like democracy for example (Green 9). Overcoming the influence of the powerful in society who may not see widespread democratization in their best interests will simply be challenging. Another theorist, Michael Schudson, asserts that technology is simply not decisive when it comes to democracy, instead we have to look at the character of the political culture in which technology operates (7). Thus, any sort of emancipatory action or protests we see online can be explained by the decline of cultural authority that defines society (Schudson 7). Schudson maps the decline in authority of the news media and the changing face of an ideal democracy asserting the current political era is one where rights and activism are important (Schudson 13). He also asserts that the Internet will reflect activism, not necessarily create more of it\\u2014it amplifies existing forces (Schudson 13). Jodi Dean (2005) is another media democracy sceptic. In her article \\u201cCommunicative Capitalism: Circulation and the Foreclosure of Politics,\\u201d Dean asserts politicians are not engaging in online dialogue, but are simply using networking communications like the Internet to flood the airwaves with their own ideas. The power relations inherent in society are simply reflected online, undermining any new opportunities for diversity (Dean 56). Dean disputes the value of online messages because, while they may be abundant, they do not elicit   11 responses (Dean 58). This misunderstanding of messages leads to what Dean calls the fantasy of participation and technological fetishism. \\u201c\\u2026They believe that they are active, maybe even that they are making a difference simply by clicking on a button, adding their name to a petition or commenting on a blog\\u201d (Dean 60). Dean labels this as interpassivity and asserts that it is depoliticizing by displacing real world struggles (Dean 61). 2.2.3 A More Nuanced Role The role of technology in enhancing democracy may be more nuanced than either camp proposes. For instance, theorists such as Wade Rowland assert that different types of technologies have different impacts on democracy. As Rowland states: Today, among the democracies of the world, communications technologies tend to be accepted as tools of liberation, weapons against oppression, and guarantors of freedom. But not all communications technologies have the same impact on democratic institutions\\u2026 (224).  Using the work of Emile Durkheim and Jurgen Habermas, Rowland distinguishes two societal outcomes of different media. The first is mechanical solidarity or a society held together by criminal law and paternal authorities (224). The second outcome is organic solidarity, which is defined by consensus, customs and continuing conversation among diverse individuals (250). Rowland separates media according to their role in creating these two different types of solidarities or integrations. Broadcast technologies like television and radio are grouped as mechanical because these technologies are largely controlled by powerful elites and offer little airtime to citizens (Rowland 251). Telephone, mail and the Internet are deemed organic technologies (Rowland 251). The Internet has a different nature than broadcasters. The Net was defined by a set of open and non-proprietary protocols that allow free and open access without any need for licensing or identification or fees or permissions, because it was designed for research and communications, not commerce or control (Rowland 398).    12 Organic media is important to democracy because it facilitates conversations and self- organization. The character of organic media creates social change. It is not technologically deterministic. Instead, the character of the media tempers determinism. Rowland identifies several social changes. The first change is interactivity. \\u2026 the ability to interact in something close to real time with information courses (to query, comment, challenge, suggest) encourages conversation as opposed to monologue, and in doing so promotes the communication of understanding as opposed to purely instrumental communication (Rowland 418).  The second socio-political change identified by Rowland is the opening up of politics because the Internet is a low-barrier, low-cost communication technology which increases political involvement defined as the ability of people to give \\u201cpolitical expression to their ideas and beliefs\\u201d (Rowland 419). Organic media is also defined by its networked nature and its ability to reproduce offline communities online as well as its tendency to produce new networks. Networks have a long-standing relationship to politics. Elihu Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld (1957) proposed a two- step flow theory of communication in which mass media messages flow through social networks and are mediated by the network\\u2019s social class, values, age, gender and education (Newton 210). Judith Trent and Robert Friedenberg\\u2019s analysis of campaign communication suggests that politicians use their networks or \\u201csocial precincts\\u201d to test out the reaction to key speeches and decisions (Trent and Friedenberg 302). Politicians will then determine which issues resonate and can be used in a campaign platform. In today\\u2019s media environment, the Internet couples the forces of technology and personal networks through its interactivity. Winograd and Hais foreshadow the potential for social networks to merge with media and influence the political agenda. The Internet has put social networks online in an accessible, digestible format. These social networks are now producing and disseminating political information. Winograd and Hais assert that reaching these voters requires that politicians engage online (Winograd and Hais 170).   13 Other scholars point to a marriage between politics and technology where both come out changed. In his examination of new media campaigns, Philip N. Howard (2006) suggests there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between technologies and society, stating: Technologies and social organizations evolve together\\u2026the search for the net effects of new media must move beyond technology diffusion questions to an examination of how technology and democratic institutions are growing together through technical and political decisions that simultaneously shape organizational constraints and capacities (38).  Technology cannot be understood outside of political culture and our understanding of political culture will not be complete without an understanding of technology\\u2019s role. American political scientist Bruce Bimber also adheres to a more nuanced view of the role of technology. Bimber places a heavy emphasis on the power of technology, but distinguishes his theoretical position from that of technological and social determinism. He suggests technology is political and can create new behaviours and institutional rules, but it does not necessarily do so (Bimber 32). However, it is not just technology, but the information flows it can deliver that create change. Bimber asserts that information is vital to democracy: In the processes by which citizen preferences are formed and aggregated, in the behaviours of citizens and elites, in formal procedures of representation, in acts of governmental decision making, in the administration of laws and regulations, and in the mechanisms of accountability that freshen democracy and sustain its legitimacy (Bimber 11).  Bimber\\u2019s analysis concludes that the Internet has shaped American politics because it makes information cheap, decentralized and widely distributed (229). He suggests that these features are changing political intermediation, organization and mobilization (229). On the other side of the democratic equation however, political engagement has been largely unaffected by the Internet. The Internet simply reinforces existing patterns of engagement (Bimber 229). Bimber also acknowledges the role of power in information distribution stating that access is unequal, mirroring traditional social inequalities and the Internet is no different (243).   14 2.2.4 The Relationship between Media and Political Decision-Making Finally, any role the Internet may play in shaping politics should also be considered with respect to studies that examine how media influence political discourse. One of the most developed theories on the relationship between media and politics is agenda-setting theory. The theory is founded on the work of Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw who studied how media coverage of political campaigns influenced the agenda of the campaign. \\u201cThe mass media force attention to certain issues by constantly presenting objects and suggesting what individuals in the mass should think about, know about and have feelings about\\u201d (McCombs and Shaw 177). The media places issues in the minds of citizens and in doing so forces the public action on these matters. McCombs and Shaw hypothesize that \\u201cthe mass media set the agenda for each political campaign, influencing the salience of attitudes toward the political issues\\u201d (McCombs and Shaw 177). They found issues covered in the news correlated with those that resonated with voters, and interpret this as evidence for mass media influence. The research allows for hypothesis building around the power of new media to influence public opinion and political action. Since McCombs and Shaw\\u2019s study, other researchers have sought to test the original agenda-setting theory with mixed success. Most of the studies demonstrate that the agenda- setting theory is contingent on external factors (Walgrave and Van Aelst 2006, Davis 2007). Steven Walgrave and Peter Van Aelst sketch out a more flexible theory of agenda-setting that is contingent on the numbers of sources for information, politicians use of the media to test political ideas, the extent to which media is seen as reflecting public opinion and institutional rules of the game (100-101). In a study of British parliamentarians, Aeron Davis comes to similar conclusions about the contingency of agenda-setting. Davis concludes that media attention on issues can shift political agendas and policy development, but not by simple stimulus-response (Davis 102). The agenda is dependent on politicians\\u2019 strategic use of the media (what can they get the journalists to communicate) and on the feedback given by   15 journalists on policy issues (Davis 184). Davis\\u2019 work allows politicians to be conceptualized as strategic actors whose agendas are not only influenced by media, but who try to influence the public agenda through media. In new interactive media forms, politicians can attempt to influence the public agenda to align with their political agenda unmediated. Agenda-setting theory is generally applied to traditional media, but extended to online communication, this premise means that issues debated on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc., become highlighted in the minds of politicians and the public as issues that require action. The promise of the Internet is that traditional media and journalists would not be the only actors producing content and thus setting the agenda, but that individuals, especially marginalized individuals, would have a chance to get issues on the agenda. In a 2009 study, Paul Wallenfelsz and Kelly Wallenfelsz compare the agenda-setting power of traditional and new media and find the agenda-setting effect weaker in people who used new media more frequently (Wallenfelsz and Wallenfelsz 11). The media is not able to play a gatekeeper role on the Internet as people pick their stories. They conclude that, while there is much work to do on new media and agenda-setting, its impacts can no longer be ignored (Wallenfelsz and Wallenfelsz 12). 2.3 The Role of the Campaign in Policy-Making and Communications Another important body of literature that informs this study concerns the purpose of political campaigns. Former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell is famous for saying, \\u201cElections are no time to debate the issues\\u201d and there is a substantial body of literature examining the purpose of elections. This section will first look at how policy-making fits into a campaign and then will turn to the role of campaign communications. According to numerous scholars, elections are about winning, not about policy development. Political scientist William Cross argues political parties have long seen their role   16 as electoral machines (Cross 425). Cross uses the findings of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing to demonstrate this point quoting: The dilemma is that the core of the party organization is concerned primarily with elections: it is much less interested in discussing and analyzing political issues that are not connected directly to winning the next election, or in attempting to communicate the broader values of the party (Cross 434).  In his book Political Parties, Cross makes it clear that the primary role of political parties is waging an election campaign (108) and that this war is not one for amateurs stating: The central campaigns are not participatory exercises; rather, they are dominated by a small group of seasoned campaigners and close associates of the party leaders\\u2026.Two groups tend to take over the parties\\u2019 central operations during election campaigns: individuals with long-standing connections to the party leader, and experienced professionals with particular campaign-related skills (122).  Policy-making is left to elected politicians in between elections when parties can employ the resources of the state to help (Cross 426). Cross\\u2019 assessment of the policy-making opportunities available flies in the face of Internet democracy optimists who argue the online world is going to strengthen democracy. While the Internet may open up opportunities for de- professionalization of politics, the current Canadian political culture of campaigning may not be amenable.  While politicians may not be spending much time policymaking during the campaign, they do exert a huge amount of energy devising campaign communications. One of the most prominent theories seeking to explain how campaign platforms and policies are developed and communicated during election campaigns is that of political marketing. As defined by Jennifer Lees-Marshment (2004), political marketing is \\u201cthe study of how politicians interface with their electorate\\u201d (3). In a framework of political marketing, political parties and politicians use professionalized tools such as public opinion research and market research to decide which policies or products to pursue (Lilleker and Lees-Marshment 7). After determining the appropriate product, political parties use marketing communication tools to sell the product.   17 Effective communication will result in an election win (Lilleker and Lees-Marshment 11). In this theory, professionalized marketing tools and public opinion research are the key forces determining political action, not the citizen dialogue that Internet optimists see driving the future of politics. In the book What are Campaigns For? James A. Gardner (2009) examines the disappointment with the quality of deliberative democracy and dialogue during a campaign. Gardner asserts that campaigns are not and should not be expected to be the formative grounds for public opinion (147). He believes it is acceptable for the campaign to be \\u201ctabulative\\u201d of the existing political thoughts of the electorate instead of persuading them to adopt new ones. The way candidates and especially voters behave during campaigns tends to reflect social norms that also guide their behaviour at other times, and it is implausible to think that people who behave one way all the time will suddenly behave in another way simply because the calendar tells them so (191).  Thus, there is no need to put pressure on campaigns to be an extraordinary site of deliberative democracy and expression of the public will (Gardner 193). The main purpose of campaigns in the literature then is not deliberative engagement or collaborative policy- making, it is using the necessary communication tools to get into office and these communications tools have changed with the rise of the Internet, warranting greater study. 2.4 Theoretical Framework This literature has informed the theoretical standpoint which I use to help explain and understand the data. While technological determinists assert, technology has a powerful role to play in politics, and society in general, scholars such as Bimber, Dean and Schudson make strong arguments that technology is limited by the current norms and practices that define political culture itself. During an election campaign one of the most important forces influencing the power of the Internet to change politics is the current campaign models   18 outlined by the work of Cross and Lilleker and Lees-Marshment. Thus, in the context of an election it will be important to study how technology interacts with these established campaign models. Neither technology nor society is independent, but they shape each other either forcing change or reinforcing the status quo. This framework will help provide insight on some of the areas that past research has not sufficiently addressed. The current body of literature does not address whether or not politicians, strategists and parties are actually listening to the voices they hear online. This is an important question because even if technological optimists can prove the Internet expands the number of voices in the public realm, it is hard to argue its democratic value if politicians are not incorporating those voices into the way they govern. Moreover, this paper will go into greater depth about if and how interactive online media has changed campaign messaging. The amount of change the Internet has produced in recent Canadian elections will be studied through qualitative interviews. I will now outline the methods employed during this study before assessing the findings.   19 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Research Approach This research study is qualitative and examines the norms and practices of political strategists with respect to online communications during the process of an election campaign. Qualitative research allows researchers to explore complex events and phenomenon. It also allows for contextualized analysis. Elections are multi-dimensional events characterized by complex relationships. While quantitative analysis is appropriate for some aspects of election study such as voter turnout or demographic analysis, it is less useful for examining the relationships between policy development, political communication, voters and online communication tools.  This study adopts qualitative researcher Yvonna S. Lincoln\\u2019s approach to epistemology. Lincoln states, \\u201cQualitative research is conducted not to confirm or disconfirm earlier findings, but rather to contribute to a process of continuous revision and enrichment of understanding of the experience or form of action under study\\u201d (Lincoln 278). It seeks to explore the relationships between campaigning and online communications and build on the debate occurring in the academic research. Moreover, it presents an assessment of a particular event within a particular community at a given time. In order to explore the new media practices of political parties, this study employs a qualitative research method of open-ended, semi-structured interviews. 3.2 Research Question An assessment of the literature has informed the research question this study seeks to answer: How are political strategists in Canada using interactive online communication /social media and new forms of online journalism to shape the development and communication of campaign platforms?   20 3.3 Interviews Interviews with political strategists are an appropriate way to study this topic because it is a study of a complex political process. Qualitative researchers Herbert J. Rubin and Irene S. Rubin (2005) describe the strengths of interviewing as \\u201cespecially good at describing social and political process, that is, how and why things change\\u201d (Rubin and Rubin 3). My work seeks to examine political change and its relationship to online media technologies. In doing so, it requires more than just quantitative research, but needs to collect data on how the participants involved with the campaign process, particularly political strategists, understand, interpret and react to innovations in information technology. This research technique is referred to as semi-structured interviewing, a process of asking focused, but flexible questions to allow participants to expand on ideas and meanings (Rubin 5). I decided to interview seven strategists from competing parties who played decision- making roles during the most recent federal election, provincial election and municipal election involving political parties in English Canada. Six of the nine parties that won seats in the 2008 and 2009 elections are included in the study. This includes two of three municipal parties, two of two provincial parties, and two of four federal parties. The majority of past research has relied on content analysis or surveying, but by interviewing political strategists my research taps into a new source of knowledge. I allowed decision-makers to address how different variables interacted during a campaign. Political communication strategists were the subjects of study because of their role in advising which online tools should be employed and monitoring online conversations. Thus, they are sources of critical information for other members of the campaign teams. Moreover, these strategists are a key part of the campaign team and participate in and/or observe the decision-making processes. The decision to interview political strategists relies on several assumptions that are supported in the literature. Interviews allow researchers to explore topics in depth and allow research participants to bring new ideas to the table (Rubin and Rubin 33). It also allows for the revelation of complex   21 and nuanced relationships and can answer why certain effects occur instead of simply examining patterns (Rubin and Rubin 21). Other forms of data collection were considered, but were deemed unsuitable for the type of information desired. Surveying would not have allowed for the open-ended questioning desired and would be less likely to reveal complicated cause-and-effect relationships. Similarly, a content analysis would largely address how citizens started talking about an issue online and when it appeared in a political platform. It does not have the power to make conclusive claims about the cause and effect relationship between political conversations online and the content of election platforms. This methodology has proven effective in Davis\\u2019 study of the media\\u2019s impact on issue agendas in the United Kingdom. The interview format revealed a complex and nuanced relationship between the government agenda and the media. It allowed Davis to uncover the fact that media attention shifts political agendas and policy development, but it does so through a complex, multi-faceted relationship instead of the simple model of assuming that citizen pressure puts an issue on the agenda (Davis 182). 3.3.1 Participant Recruitment I sought out subjects in a variety of ways. Contacting party offices was often the first step in identifying individual research subjects. There was also a public media trail identifying possible research participants. Moreover, I used my personal networks to identify individuals who would be able to direct me to appropriate participants in my study. Once a pool of potential interviewees was established, I sent formal emails introducing myself and explaining the purpose and procedure of my study. I followed up with telephone calls or email to confirm the possibility of their participation. In other instances, individuals provided me with the contact information for a person that worked more closely with the online campaign. Subsequently, an appropriate interview time was established with those   22 interested in participating.1 The interviews were in person or by phone depending on the location of the interviewees. 3.3.2 Data Analysis and Collection The data collection process consisted of semi-structured interviews ranging from one to one-and-a-half hours. I asked participants questions from an initial list developed previously. Questions were developed based on research objectives and were linked to the theoretical and conceptual issues identified in the literature review. Interview questions were adapted to each individual to allow interviewees to have influence in leading the conversation and emphasizing the aspects on the online campaign they believed were most important (See Appendix A for a list of questions). All interviews were tape-recorded with participants\\u2019 permission and transcribed fully for data analysis. Copies of the transcripts were provided to each interviewee for review. Data collected during the interview process was coded thematically as per methods laid out by Rubin and Rubin (209-223). The coding was done within two weeks of each interview. This process followed an open coding process in which any and all potential concepts that exist in the data are labelled against a key of codes that include a definition and a description of how to know when the concepts exists. Subsequently, I highlighted the most relevant concepts as part of a focused coding process. The important concepts that emerged are the major points of discussion in the final analysis.  1 Interviewees were provided with an informed consent form to sign as per UBC research ethics standards (See Appendix B for ethics certificate). The consent form allowed them to request anonymity. Confidentiality was desired by most participants. To protect the confidentiality of participants and the information they provided, the interviews and transcripts were only accessed by the researchers and were kept in a secure location. The interviewees also had the freedom to choose the location of the interview if done in person. Phone interviews were conducted in a private room. Interviewees will only be identified by numbers in the remainder of this study to protect their identities.   23 3.3.3 Research Limitations Before analyzing the data collected through the interviews, it is important to highlight the limitations of the study. Primarily, the sample size of political strategists, while representative of those involved in the elections studied, is small. Moreover, the study examines three specific events meaning the results are not generalizable. These elections are bounded in time, historical circumstances and are defined by the politicians, strategists and citizens participating in them. Instead, this study is meant to reveal patterns, which could serve to as a starting point for other studies and can contribute to theory-building in this field. This goal is consistent with those set out by qualitative researchers. For example, Earl Babbie and Lucia Benaquisto state, \\u201cA major goal in the analysis of qualitative data is to reveal themes that emerge from data. This process is largely a search for patterns of similarities and differences, followed by an interpretation of those patterns\\u201d (392). Other researchers point to the value of these uncovered patterns for theory elaboration. Rubin and Rubin suggest information from particular cases can help contribute to existing theories by pushing them further or challenging their applicability (7). This is consistent with the view that there are local forms of truth that may not be generalizable, but can be a valid contribution to our understanding of social phenomena. In arguing research should be considered valid based on its design and execution rather than on the positivist \\u201ctrinity of reliability, validity and generalization\\u201d (Kvale 37), Steiner Kvale has written: The present understanding of validity starts in the lived world and daily language, where issues of reliable witnesses, of valid documents and arguments, are part of the social interaction\\u2026It accepts the possibility of specific local, personal, and community forms of truth, with a focus on daily life and local narrative (21).  Thus, while this study may not be generalizable, it has been designed with the principles of accuracy, thoroughness and believability in mind (Rubin and Rubin 769-70). It seeks to make a small contribution to a growing field of study.   24 4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 4.1 Cases in Context Before presenting the findings of my research, a brief contextualization of the elections studied is warranted. In 2008-2009, Canadians living in British Columbia faced three separate elections. The first of these elections was the federal election held on October 14, 2008. The incumbent party was the Conservative Party of Canada led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. There were five primary parties in contention for seats including the Conservative Party, Liberal Party, New Democratic Party, Bloc Quebecois and Green Party. The result of the election had the Conservative Party win a minority government. Voter turnout was 58.8 per cent, the lowest recorded in Canadian history (Elections Canada 2008). Shortly after, the City of Vancouver held a municipal election on November 15, 2008. Vancouver\\u2019s municipal government is a party system with three primary parties vying for seats on city council. These parties are Vision Vancouver, Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) and the Non-Partisan Alliance (NPA). The result of the election had Vision Vancouver win the majority of the council seats with COPE winning two seats and the NPA winning one. The final election was held on May 12, 2009 at the provincial level with the BC Liberal Party, the BC New Democratic Party and the Green Party as the three parties in contention for seats. The BC Liberal Party came out with a majority government, winning 46 per cent of the popular vote. Voter turnout was a mere 50 per cent (CBC 2009). This paper will now examine the specific themes uncovered during the course of the interviews.    25 4.2 Political Parties Extend Old Habits Online While campaigns were optimistic about the Internet\\u2019s capacity to reach voters and the media in new ways, the interviews suggested online campaign strategies were largely reactionary and their execution presented a migration of the traditional campaign onto a new platform. The interview material suggests that the use of technology is contingent on social forces as well as existing norms and practices of political campaigning in line with theories elucidated by Lelia Green and Michael Schudson. This section presents reasons why parties decided to campaign online and discusses how the Internet influences traditional campaign practices. It will conclude with an assessment of how the literature helps explain the themes. 4.2.1 Following the Audience Online A common theme throughout the interviews was that parties were driven online by the sheer size of the audience. With voters and journalists already online, Internet campaigning was seen as a necessary part of doing business. The growing number of voters using the Internet as part of their daily lives appeared to be the driving force behind the development of an online campaign. As one strategist summarized, We can see the research coming out that voters are getting more and more of their news from online sources and less from traditional print and television media. We adjusted our engagement strategy to start to use these tools, if nothing else, as something to try to communicate with people in the way they are seeking out information (Strategist A).  Strategists recognized the fact that digital media was an essential part of people\\u2019s lifestyles and that politics had to follow. As those platforms grow and people use digital tools to communicate together, the impact of digital on a campaign will become more profound because it is just where people spend their time (Strategist B).  Strategists explained there were consequences to staying offline. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a way of life and failing to engage people in the way they communicate means you aren\\u2019t going to reach them\\u201d   26 (Strategist C). As evidence of the primacy of digital media in the lives of voters, many political strategists cited the high traffic to party websites during the election campaign. Several strategists also talked about the mainstream media being a key online audience. \\u201cThe biggest factor is the reporters sitting there in front of their computer. They are the ones that are the interpreter to the general public more than the Internet is\\u201d (Strategist A). With reporters doing more and more reporting from their offices, this strategist underscored the importance of providing the media with accessible information. However, it went beyond just providing information. For all of the interviewees, innovative online campaigning was a method of gaining media attention from print, television and radio outlets. \\u201cPartially, it\\u2019s about getting these process stories written because the mainstream press gets bored some days and wants to write about something else and they will write about your new media strategy\\u201d (Strategist D). Many strategists could think of examples of media coverage of the online campaign including stories about viral video, a digital van that toured British Columbia, and social media campaigns. The strategists recognized that the media coverage of new media was driven by the novelty of some of the online tools such as Twitter. Some political strategists mentioned fear of bad press if they were not online. For example, a political strategist explained, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t not do it or there will be a story about how your party isn\\u2019t engaged with young people or isn\\u2019t using new media tools\\u201d (Strategist C). In effect, it appears that political parties reacted to the practices of voters and the media in their campaigning practices rather than leading the way. At the same time during the course of the interviews, it became quite evident that the online campaign was not only reactionary, but also it extended traditional campaign tools. 4.2.2 Traditional Campaign Activities in a Digital Age The Internet is breathing new life into traditional campaign instead of creating a transformation of the campaign process. Political strategists explained that volunteering,   27 databank management, door-knocking, phone calls, and leaders tours are imperative to getting out the content of campaign platforms and information about candidates. These campaign activities have migrated and extended online. One of those activities mentioned by campaigners was fundraising. Many strategists said they were inspired by the fundraising success of the Obama campaign. \\u201cThat sort of fundraising has the potential to change a campaign, so if you hit it in some parallel way, you could just spend your opponent into the ground\\u201d (Strategist F). This strategist\\u2019s party formatted their entire online campaign to enhance potential financial windfalls. Others reported record fundraising thanks to the help of soliciting donations online (Strategist C).  Another campaign function bolstered by the Internet was volunteering. All political strategists solicited volunteers online. Moreover, databanks are now housed online allowing volunteers to call voters via automated systems. This allowed campaigners to break down geographic barriers between ridings. One strategist reported that the party could use volunteers from \\u201cunwinnable\\u201d ridings to make calls in another far-flung riding where the party is competitive (Strategist C). Political strategists explained that online communications tools were also used to bolster campaign events such as the leader\\u2019s tour. Strategists talked about how messages sent out online promoted and reinforced the day-to-day announcements made by party leaders and candidates. One strategist explained, \\u201cThe tour and the announcement of the day\\u2026What we put online is basically everything. There is the daily narrative of message of the day.\\u201d (Strategist C). At the same time, political strategists expressed that they have not abandoned the practice of message control and consistency during the campaign. Online messages are inline with those communicated at announcements, in news releases, and in media interviews. As one strategist summed up, Like any campaign, we developed central messaging that has been tested among our supporters and we would stick in a pretty disciplined way to that message box. The   28 worst thing obviously is being caught off message and particularly there is a huge possibility in online campaigning of one bad tweet, one bad ad, or one bad Facebook message getting picked up by the daily newspaper writers (Strategist C).  Political strategists set up careful checks on messaging that goes out online just like those in place for other media platforms. \\u201cThe number one key to mitigating risk was, let\\u2019s make sure this goes past enough eyes\\u201d (Strategist E).  Similarly, the age-old campaign focus on developing the leader has been given new life online according to political strategists. Political strategists report using the Internet to market candidates and leaders in new ways. \\u201cA real marketing advantage for [candidates] and [parties] is to find any method to provide open access to personality and sincerity\\u201d (Strategist F). The Internet, and especially social media, allowed candidates to display their personalities. For example, one party encouraged the leader to Twitter about hockey to give this individual more interest in the minds of voters (Strategist C). The online media allows politicians to interact with constituents, and thus share their personalities in subtle ways, which according to strategists is one of the big challenges on the campaign. You have to define the leader and you can\\u2019t send out a release saying [the leader] is caring, but hard working. Defining a leader is much more subtle than that. The online universe could give us another dimension in terms of defining, particularly [the leader], but also to some extent candidate in terms of who they actually are (Strategist C).  Online communication appeared to be valued as an accessible and convenient way to demonstrate personality with little effort and a large potential audience. Despite all the online developments, political strategists said in the end the best way to get out the message about the platform is still face-to-face interaction. As one strategist states, \\u201cIn my mind there is still no real substitute for going out there and knocking on doors, phoning people and actually engaging people directly.\\u201d Another affirms, \\u201cIt\\u2019s the proven number one way of getting someone to vote for you\\u201d (Strategist A). Online tools can help campaigners organize information and volunteers, but it is still humans that elicit response. One strategist described it this way. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just a matter of connecting modern technology and   29 human beings where at the end of the day there wasn\\u2019t anything magical about it. It is a volunteer talking to a voter. It\\u2019s something very traditional, but very effective\\u201d (Strategist C). 4.2.3 Interpreting the Findings Taken together, these findings leave us with a larger picture in which the online campaign described by political strategists is shaped by societal patterns as well as political norms and practices. In some ways, this picture is supportive of a social deterministic view of the technology set out by scholars like Green. For Green, society is responsible for how new technologies are adopted and implemented (Green 3). This seems consistent with how political strategists talked about why they campaigned online. The existence of the Internet did not push strategists to campaign online, instead the interview material suggests the strategists were reacting to shifting social practices. Strategists saw citizens changing their information consumption habits and thus altered their behaviour to meet that demand. Cultural forces thus seem to have played an important role in initiating online campaigning. Similarly, the idea that political culture strongly influenced campaign practices online finds support in many accounts offered by political strategists. The interview material suggests that political strategists did not deviate from the practices that define current campaign culture. This campaign culture in Canada is described by William Cross and it seems to be reflected in the ways in which strategists have applied online tools. As stated previously, Cross asserts that the main functions of political parties are electoral machines (425). The goal is to win the election, so it is unsurprising that political strategists would try to enhance their existing arsenal of tried and true election tools with the Internet\\u2019s power. In fact, that is exactly what social determinists would expect. Green states \\u201ctechnologies express the priorities of those who champion them\\u201d (Green 6). The goal of an election is to win and a part of that strategy is to get people involved in the political process primarily through voting, but also through volunteering, donating and attending events. Internet tools have proven   30 successful for fundraising and volunteering in the Obama campaign, which are and have been for decades, essential parts of a winning campaign. Thus, to be competitive, traditional tools must be adapted. The existing norms and practices of electioneering migrate online as another method to help achieve the ultimate goal, election. Cross\\u2019 analysis also helps to provide insight about why a focus on the leader appears to have migrated online. Cross argues the importance of party leaders in the Canadian political landscape and asserts that they dominate campaigns (Cross 76). Political strategists mentioned the Internet as a key site to develop a leader\\u2019s personality. In effect, it appears that the political culture defined by familiar campaign tools is a strong determining force for how the Internet is applied in a Canadian electoral context. However, the interview material did suggest innovation when it came to engaging and connecting with voters online, a theme that will now be discussed. 4.3 New Opportunities to Engage and Network Another theme that became evident during the interviews was that political strategists saw value in using the Internet to engage people and tap into new audiences. They expressed optimism that by disseminating messages through an interactive and networked medium, politics could be made relevant for unengaged voters. Similarly, during the course of the interviews it became evident that most political strategists acknowledged that there was a growing for new online influencers such as bloggers. The interview material suggests political strategists initially regarded the promise of the Internet in a similar way as technological determinists such as McLuhan, Levinson and Winograd and Hais. However, the results of their efforts appears to more consistent with Jodi Dean\\u2019s account of \\u201ctechnological fetishism\\u201d\\u2014a suggestion that is underscored by the low voter turnout in each election. This section will present the approach of political strategists to new engagement and networking opportunities including those presented by bloggers. It will conclude with an assessment of how the literature can help explain the interview material concerning these themes.   31 4.3.1 Communicating Messages in a Digital Age Many of the political strategists explained that the Internet allowed them to contextualize their policies in an attempt to make them relevant to more voters. As one strategist explained, If I don\\u2019t ever see anything that I care about, I\\u2019m never going to vote. I think it has the potential to activate more people because you can spend your time engaging, debating and getting information from political parties or special interest groups that are relevant to me (Strategist B).  The characteristics of the Internet allow political strategists to target and personalize messages for specific voters, with the hope that it will change their actions. Parties can create layers of information that provides voters with an in-depth and contextualized look at the issues as well as the candidates. As one strategist explained, If I can surround that with links and video and with other things that make it contextually-relevant, my ability to provide an idea of why the issue matters and what other areas of the economy it might impact\\u2026it starts to tell a better narrative about why the policy matters (Strategist B).  Political strategists suggest that, online, policies can be more than just long documents left up to the interpretation of journalists. Politicians are making an attempt to better explain what they are offering voters. Many political strategists discussed microsites as a key contextual tools used in the last election. Microsites are single-page websites focused on a single issue or candidate. Parties used these sites to dump video and text to help give voters more information (Strategists E, F, and G). In other cases, these sites were used to attack the issues and parties of other politicians. One party talked about cutting videos of the leader from another party with clips from their own candidates discrediting their policies (Strategist B). Another party used a microsite to publicize another leader\\u2019s political gaffes (Strategist F).  At the same time as trying to present issues in a way that make voters care, some political strategists talked about their attempts to build interactive online infrastructure that could facilitate democratic dialogue. The interviews demonstrated that most political   32 strategists had the goal of creating an interactive campaign and designing web tools that allowed feedback. As one stated, \\u201cGive them the opportunity to say something about [the platform] and actually be heard\\u201d (Strategist G). Political strategists reported voters would react to political messages and then start dialogues with their friends, more often than directing that communication back at the political party. Few strategists could provide examples of when this infrastructure actually resulted in meaningful episodes of interaction between parties and strategists. One party gave the example of the indirect feedback it received on its environmental policy (Strategist C). Instead of directing dissatisfaction to the party website or email account, voters used online websites like bcvotes.ca and nodice.com as well as Facebook and Twitter to express their views. The strategist said that these sorts of conversations, while not directed at the party, were fed back up the communication chain and affected conversations about policy and how to communicate it (Strategist C).  It also became evident that many political strategists acknowledged the power of online networks in facilitating message penetration. All of the strategists report using social networking sites to reach greater audiences. Half of the parties had formal \\u2018digital activism\\u2019 campaigns where supporters were identified and sent party messages to push through their social networks on Facebook, Twitter or email lists (Strategists B,C,E). These campaigns allowed political parties to direct messages at hundreds of people initially, who then could choose to forward the messages on through their social networks creating a giant multiplier effect. One party even reported implementing a Facebook application that allowed them to control supporters\\u2019 statuses (Strategist B). The strategist explained, What you are activating is all the virility of the social networking technology and using it to put messages we want people to talk about into their status\\u2026And if you and I are best friends, you opinion matters to me a lot more than somebody I read in the paper (Strategist B).  The trust relationships underpinning these connections were identified as an important component in communicating political platforms. \\u201cIf I share something with my network of friends, people are more likely to perceive that story as credible. Essentially, you are creating   33 a network of validators\\u201d (Strategist C). Social networks were seen as a powerful information tool because they enabled independent validation of the political message by an individual trusted by their peers. Along with tapping into voters\\u2019 social networks, political parties also built their own. Parties found Facebook and Twitter to be a valuable tool allowing them to broadcast messages to thousand of people. 4.3.2 New Messengers in a Digital Age The networked nature of the Internet has also enabled the rise of new opinion leaders. Political strategists identified bloggers as an important site of opinion leadership. Most parties reported special outreach to bloggers including press conferences, exclusive interviews with leaders, story pitches, and even scoops (Strategists A, B, C, D,E,F). Political strategists explained that bloggers had an audience that could receive political messages. You respond because these folks are opinion leaders at some level. We know that mainstream press read his site. We know that [other parties] read his site and if he picks up on something, they can pick up on something and make it into something and it works in both directions\\u2026but at the end of the day people read them and form opinions\\u201c (Strategists C).  The blogosphere was like a virtual coffee shop for another strategist\\u2014a place where citizens can go to hear dozens of different opinions. \\u201cThese are informed Canadians, and in some cases not, that are really aware of what\\u2019s going on and they are talking about the issues\\u201d (Strategist E). Networked opinion leaders appeared to present an alternative to the top-down opinion leaders in traditional media. Strategists acknowledged the fact that organic technology like the Internet facilitates dialogue and has the potential to impact political opinions. A further benefit of targeting new opinion leaders mentioned by several political strategists was bypassing media gatekeepers and using bloggers to set the public agenda. As one strategist stated, \\u201cWe use the Internet to communicate our message and we hope that our message is what voters think is important\\u201d (Strategist G). The online activism described   34 by political strategists is another example. Party faithful sent out policy and campaign messages through Facebook pages, MySpace, YouTube, Twitter and e-mail prompting people to think about the issues the party was campaigning on. It is important to note here that the strategists maintained that journalists exercise more influence over voters and thus command more attention. \\u201cWe have a pretty good idea of what happens when there is an article in the Vancouver Sun or a story on Global, but when a blogger with a readership of 5,000 publishes something, we don\\u2019t know how it affects the electorate\\u201d (Strategist C). Political strategists identify mainstream media as the main source of political information for voters. In the words of one strategist, \\u201cBloggers aren\\u2019t taken seriously because they don\\u2019t have the reach\\u201d (Strategist A). Another compared the reach to traditional media. At the end of the day, most of what is published on the Vancouver Sun still is published in the paper and they send out thousands of copies a day. I am not going to pretend there is a blogger with a readership remotely approaching a Sun columnist (Strategist C).  Because of the limited reach of bloggers and the established audience for mainstream media, journalists appeared to remain the focus for strategists. Political strategists reported that only 10-20 per cent of effort was spent doing online campaigning, compared to the 80-90 per cent effort expended on traditional campaigning including mainstream media outreach. 4.3.3  Bringing the Online World Offline Key to understanding these actions is an examination of how political strategists talked about the goals of online messaging. Many political strategists seemed confident that these messages and attempts at engagement would have an offline effect. In the words of one strategist: Use the online to penetrate. Use the online to create discussion. And then transition into real collaboration\\u2026What we did was try to engage all along through stuff like Facebook advertising\\u2026And then we would say, we are having a meeting, would you like to come (Strategist E)?    35 Another political strategist expressed this optimism in a similar fashion. \\u201c[The] goal was that when you contacted them online\\u2026their goal was to convert you to a donor and more importantly to a volunteer in the real world, not the online world (Strategist C).\\u201d While some political strategists appeared confident about their ability to translate online action into real life action. Another was more critical about the success of the party\\u2019s attempts. \\u201cFor us, most of what\\u2019s online stays online. It doesn\\u2019t turn into real life connections which is something [Obama] has been able to do quite well in the States\\u201d [Strategist D]. This scepticism is born out in the actual results of the election campaign. Voter turnout in the federal and provincial levels hit record lows, while voter turnout in the municipal election was the lowest since 1942. 4.3.4 Interpreting the Findings This section has laid out the new ways that political strategists indicated they were communicating with voters thanks to the Internet. It has also revealed how they talked about the goals of the messaging. It found that political strategists saw value in using the Internet to engage people and tap into new audiences, but that those efforts were not reflected in the electoral outcome. In many ways, these findings suggest political strategists initially regarded the promise of the Internet in a similar way as technological determinists. The characteristics of the Internet as a technology\\u2014interactivity, networked and personal\\u2014were seen to have the potential to change the political behaviour of voters in the real world. Thus, the technology would touch and transform every part of citizens\\u2019 lives, including the political, as posited by Marshall McLuhan (Littlejohn 267). There seems to be some belief, on behalf of some strategists, that the Internet would exponentially multiply the numbers of messages and activate users as outlined by Paul Levinson (38). However, clearly the rates of voter turnout were not consistent with a view of an all-powerful technological force. This leads us to look to the mitigating role of political culture. Jodi Dean\\u2019s account of \\u201ctechnological fetishism\\u201d appears more consistent with the electoral results and can help   36 explain the divergence. Dean\\u2019s theory sets out the idea that technology creates a \\u201cfantasy of participation\\u201d (60). Essentially, Dean asserts that real life political action is being replaced by Internet activity (60). As Dean describes, People believe that their contribution to circulating content is a kind of communication action. They believe that they are active, maybe even that they are making a difference simply by clicking on a button, adding their name to a petition or commenting on a blog (60).  Instead of actually having a real impact, online action is used as a \\u201cfetish\\u201d while other forces replace citizens offline (Dean 60). Dean argues this action is depoliticizing because people struggle for their political goals online replacing the real life achievement of these goals and securing the sphere of official politics for the powerful (61). The working of such a fantasy is clear in discussions of the political impact of a new device, system, code or platform. A particular technological innovation becomes a screen upon which all sorts of fantasies of political action are projected (Dean 62).  Thus, the Internet has become a realm in which citizens project their fantasies of political action replacing real world action including voting. This could help explain why even if there is increasing activity online, it did not translate into action in the real world. Dean\\u2019s work also helps elucidate the relationship, or lack thereof, between messaging and democratic action. Dean makes it clear that penetrating messaging will not necessarily inspire political action from citizens, but in fact do the opposite. It is clear that political strategists increased the number of messages they were sending during the campaign including information about political parties, their policies and their candidates. The amount of information available is often theorized as a democratic good in and of itself. Even Michael Schudson who is critical about the power of information technology to change democracy states, \\u201cA more informed citizenry will create a better and fuller democracy\\u201d (Schudson 205). The Internet has exponentially increased the amount of information available to citizens and has presented it in new formats that are easier to understand. However, while this type of   37 communication may be necessary, it is not sufficient for democracy. Dean would argue that the ability of politicians to send messages online just reinforces their views at the expensive of soliciting true, two-way communication (Dean 63). The interview material indicates that there has been a multiplication of messages flowing from politicians to citizens without a reciprocal flow back from citizens. This multiplication of one-way messages is not simply a function of technology, although technology enables it. It is reflective of the power relationships between political parties and citizens. Similarly, it is important to consider how political psychology interacts with and mitigates the power of the Internet. While the interview material suggests that the Internet has enhanced the information available, there is little evidence that it increases the size of the audience seeking it out. Microsites may exist, but citizens have to find them. Videos might be posted on YouTube, but potential voters have to search for them. Politicians might be on Twitter, but citizens have to be following them. Some citizens will take action to find these new information sources, however, political psychology informs us that that segment is small (Bimber 149). Bruce Bimber argues that voters will choose to read online only what they are interested in, political or not (Bimber 149). As Bimber quotes Curtis Gans in his book Campaigning Online: The Internet in U.S. Elections: \\u201cWhile candidates\\u2026may design the most complete sources of information and the most compelling presentations of that information, what they cannot do is provide the motivation to access those sites\\u201d (Bimber 153). The political strategists interviewed expressed similar concerns about the true reach of the Internet. \\u201cWe are still talking, in terms of the people we are reaching, about our base and the people who are still paying attention anyways. There\\u2019s still the problem of disengaged, disenfranchised voters (Strategist D).\\u201d Another strategist labelled the problem as one of hyper-engagement. \\u201c[The Internet] has become a disengagement rather than engagement tool. It\\u2019s become a fragmented engagement tool where there can be hyper-engagement among fragmented groups. They become quite an echo-chamber (Strategist A).\\u201d   38 The idea that political culture plays a leading role in determining the shape of an online campaign also sheds light onto the findings concerning the power of bloggers. The focus on mainstream media reflects its place in current political culture. According to work done by Fred Fletcher and Mary Lynn Young, 54.1 per cent of voters report getting their information from television, 19.1 per cent receive political information from newspapers and 8.1 per cent get information about politics from radio (Fletcher and Young 11). In contrast, only 7.1 per cent of voters get the majority of their political information online (Fletcher and Young 11). The Internet cannot provide a mass, captive audience; instead, citizens have to seek out information online (Bimber and Davis 147). Moreover, Bimber argues that even if citizens do look for information online, it still may not be as effective as mass media encounters because of \\u201cvoter selectivity\\u201d that is the tendency for people to seek out sources of information that confirm their existing beliefs (Bimber and Davis 148-149). Thus, reader habits online seem to be inline with political culture and the Internet simply enables readers with more fragmented information. Now that this paper has presented the findings concerning how the Internet has affected the communication of the campaign platform, I will turn to its impacts, or lack thereof, on the platform-building process. 4.4 Few Opportunities to Impact Policy While many strategists listed tapping new audiences and engaging more people as important goals of the campaign, eliciting feedback on policy issues was not discussed as an appropriate online activity. The interview material indicated that strategists did not use the online campaign and the feedback it elicited to shape party policy, specifically the campaign platform. Rather, strategists explained that professionalized tools such as polling were the most trusted pictures of public opinion. This material presents a picture of a campaign that is still driven by professionals rather than citizens when it comes to determining the issues\\u2014an observation that seems consistent with the literature about political norms and practices   39 around platform-building as laid out by theorists such as Cross and Lees-Marshment. Again, the interviews appear consistent with the view that political culture plays a mitigating role in the power of technology to force political change. This section will present how political strategists assessed the Internet\\u2019s value in platform-building and reflecting public opinion on issues. It concludes with an examination of how the literature can help explain the interview material concerning these themes. 4.4.1 A Professionalized Platform-Building Process It is assumed that a democratic government will create public policy that reflects the will of the people. During an election, policy is contained in the campaign platform, which sets out a party\\u2019s planned actions if they form a government. While traditionally, platform-building has been an activity relegated to the realm of party members or the backrooms of political strategists, the Internet provides the opportunity to open up the process to more participants. However, the majority of the strategists interviewed described a highly professionalized and/or party-focused platform-building procedure. Political strategists identified public opinion research, party conventions or the goals of party leaders as the main sources of campaign policy. As one strategist stated, \\u201cYou are not going to just create a platform on a bunch of stuff people send you. It has got to be strategic to get votes. People that send stuff in aren\\u2019t going to be strategic thinkers\\u201d (Strategist C). Another expressed, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not some big collaborative effort that everybody things it is\\u201d (Strategist A). Half of the parties explicitly mentioned that they valued the Internet\\u2019s ability to allow direct feedback from citizens. During the campaign however, none of the party strategists could name a specific instance where feedback changed the course of a party\\u2019s platform. The most-commonly cited feedback was positive affirmation, which was indicated by an approving email or a \\u201cthumb\\u2019s up\\u201d on Facebook.   40 The nature of the Internet has also lead some writers (Morris 1999, Winograd and Hais 2008) to believe that online communications would be a key site for the expression of public opinion. The value political strategists placed on public opinion for platform-building came out through many of the interviews; however, strategists explained that the Internet was not an accurate gauge of public opinion. The Internet provides raw, unfiltered comments and concerns from citizens, but according to most of the strategists, it does not allow for the scientific accuracy or representativeness desired by political parties when drafting the campaign platform. As one strategist explained, I always tell [elected members] that many anecdotes do not comprise data. At the end of the day, 20 people calling your office, while it may seem significant, it is still just 20 people, when you represent 60,000. You want repeatable, verifiable results\\u2026. If parties wrote policy based on even just the correspondence they got, it could really mean neglecting a vast majority of the voters (Strategist C).  The Internet is not seen as an accurate source for policy-informing public opinion, however, half of those interviewed said they believed informal online \\u201cheat maps\\u201d of public opinion could play a complementary role to scientific public opinion polling in future campaigns. There were two exceptions to the findings presented above, representing some new innovations in platform-building in the lead-up to the election. One of these parties did have a small, informal online forum to discuss policy, but ultimately the political strategist reported that party membership created the platform (Strategist D). Moreover, one party did use the Internet to open up its platform-building process in advance of the election.2 This party hosted a website where voters could submit their ideas for future government action. The official rhetoric surrounding the efforts clearly espoused the idea that the campaign platform was an essential opportunity to hear from citizens. As the website reads, \\u201cElections are a time for parties to lay out their plan for the future of the province. But plans are created by people sharing their ideas and being clear about their priorities for their province\\u2026we launched [this initiative] to give all [citizens] a new forum to  2 This finding has been brought in separately from the interview process. Its inclusion does not necessarily indicate the inclusion of the quoted party in the pool of interviewees.   41 share their views on the issues facing our province, their input on the progress we are making together and the path they would choose to the future\\u201d (BC Liberals 2009).  The website was open to all members of the public and it solicited 1,500 submissions that helped inform the platform. The website was complemented by a digital van that travelled across the province and solicited input from voters about issues they believed were important and complementary policy ideas. While the process was open in the lead-up to the campaign, party strategists decided on the final content of the platform. 4.4.2 Interpreting the Findings The research findings shed light on the research question concerning the impact of the Internet on the development of the campaign platform. The Internet\\u2019s potential as a channel for citizen input into election campaigns has not lived up to the optimism of technological determinists such as Winograd and Hais or scholars like Rowland who believe networked technologies have the characteristics needed to strengthen democracy by giving people a voice in policy decisions. The findings suggest that, in most cases, online communication had little impact on the development of the campaign platform in the three elections studied. Instead, there was a measure of distrust in the scientific value of online communications as a gauge of public opinion and electoral direction. Anecdotes do not comprise data, tweets do not make public opinion and Facebook groups are not focus groups. While there are more opportunities for a greater number of voices to be heard online, there is not a trusted, scientific way to gauge what the opinions mean. The literature on political campaigns and the primacy of political marketing can help us understand why political strategists have been hesitant to use online communication to inform campaign platforms. The activities surrounding platform-building described by political strategists seems to be in line with established academic accounts of political norms and practices. The framework of political marketing set out by Jennifer Lees-Marshment highlights   42 the use of public opinion research to decide the appropriate policies to include in a political platform. Political marketing is about political organizations adapting techniques (such as market research) and concepts (such as market orientation to satisfy user demands) originally used in the business world to help the organizations achieve their goals (Lees-Marshment 9).  Everything is professionalized and starts with the practice of market research, which occurs well before the campaign (Lees-Marshment 18). This market research includes polling, public opinion research and focus groups and is meant to design a product (read policies) that appeals to voters during the campaign. This is not surprising as extensive literature examines the professionalization of politics and the rise in the role of political consultants. Other studies have focused on the primacy of political consultants in determining policy areas of focus based on research with focus groups (Johnson 107). Understanding is further bolstered by the way this professionalization fits with Cross\\u2019 assessment of our political culture. Cross explains that our electoral system does not incorporate room for policy-making, which instead happens between elections by parliamentary members (426). This process of political marketing is similar to the one laid out by political strategists. They undertake market research in the months leading up to the campaign and create a platform based on that information. As a result, the Internet seems more like a place to promote the finished product than a place to develop it during an election campaign. In effect, these findings demonstrate how the practices and tools of current political culture still seem to be preeminent despite new technology that provides new sources of information. Of course, there was one exception borne out in the open platform process of one party, but for the most part, we are still witnessing political parties maintaining closed policy-making process despite changes new technologies offer.   43 5. CONCLUSION The results of this study shed interesting light onto the question about how online communication tools affect the development and communication of the campaign platform in Canadian elections. The findings suggest that the Internet, while a promising new tool, online campaign strategies were largely reactionary and represented migrations of traditional campaign tools onto a new platform. There were indications that political strategists are both making and taking new opportunities to extend the reach of their messaging and engage more people with those messages by tapping into networks, building interactive infrastructure and interacting with online influencers. The Internet allows political parties to get their messages out to more people through networks, as well as allowing them more space to contextualize their policies. This change has the potential to allow for a strengthened dialogue between voters and political parties. However, the research suggests that these efforts had more of an effect in terms of broadcasting than engagement. Similarly, online communications have yet to make inroads in terms of shaping the campaign platform. Political strategists still report relying on traditional means of testing political will including polling and public opinion research in an attempt to build the winning platform. The theoretical framework outlined at the beginning of this report helps make sense of the themes uncovered in this research. The findings suggest the Internet is not a benign force, but it is not the defining variable of online campaigns. However, it can be argued that the Internet\\u2019s impact on the development and communication of the campaign platform is mitigated by existing society, especially the established norms and practices of political culture. Political culture, and the norms and practices it entails, appears to be the key force in determining how online campaigning takes shape in Canada. The interview materials suggest politicians followed broader social trends when deciding to launch an online campaign and   44 refurbished established campaigning practices. Even attempts at innovation including interactive messaging, the use of social networks and the rise of bloggers seem to be limited in their impact due to the effects of \\u201ctechnological fetishism\\u201d (Dean 60) and \\u201cvoter selectivity\\u201d (Bimber 148). Finally, the professionalized culture of the platform-building process staved off the participatory potential of the Internet. To a substantial extent, these results point to the influence of political culture in determining how the Internet is applied in Canada. Thus, the theoretical framework informed by social constructivist academics Bimber, Dean and Schudson as well as political theorists Cross and Lees-Marshment help make sense of these research findings by setting out the possibility that technology must interact with and thus is shaped by existing cultural forces. This paper presents a first look at how Canadian political parties are using and responding to online communication tools during elections campaigns, but it also provides direction for several other areas for future study. The Internet has moved to the core of contemporary political communications and should command greater academic attention. A promising area for future research will be opportunities for influencing the policy, especially the development of the campaign platform, between elections. This research made it clear that the time to influence policy is between elections. Future study should be watchful for openings the Internet could facilitate in this process. Currently, one political party in Canada seems to be experimenting with a more open process of setting priorities. Canada @ 150 was the Liberal Party of Canada\\u2019s 2010 policy conference. The conference was an exclusive event, with a $700 per person price tag. However, the party tried to open up the process by streaming the conference proceedings online, and many constituency offices were transformed into theatres for interested citizens. Citizens could also use Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to contribute ideas or questions to the conference. This conference is only a first step towards creating policy, but it seems to represent a more open process, facilitated in part by the Internet.   45 Another important area for study will remain whether or not the current model of broadcasting and political marketing shifts over time and political strategists experiment and learn how to facilitate a greater flow of two-way dialogue. Moreover, will this two-way dialogue engage a greater diversity of people; that is those citizens who are not already previously engaged. Canada @ 150 might be a good place to start examining these questions because it is a small sample of people. It will also be interesting to see whether online communication will lead to greater fragmentation. As part of studying the potential for growth in two-way online dialogue between political parties and the citizens they seek to represent, more study should be directed towards studying barriers to Internet campaigning in the Canadian context. According to the political strategists interviewed, these barriers include spending limits, privacy laws, small audiences and a small pool of influential online personalities.  A final question that should be explored in future research is how much pressure we should put on the media and technology to renew political engagement. Focusing too strongly on what can be done to make information technologies a force for democracy may blind researchers, policy makers and citizens to other aspects of the electoral system and political culture that need to change. Information and information technology certainly have a role to play in connecting people with politicians and policy issues, however it is unreasonable to consider new applications of media and discourse as a panacea for declining interest in the political system. There are other reforms that could work in tandem with more responsive and dialogue-oriented political communication. For example, it might not be enough for people to see their pet issue discussed on Twitter. Perhaps, a better way to make people feel relevant and listened to is electoral reform, open policy processes, candidates that are more relevant or a decline in negative campaigning.   46 6.

When media coverage of a natural disaster dwindles, public attention also tends to shift to other issues. This can have an impact on both private donations for humanitarian relief efforts, as well as the pressures put on governments to offer official aid packages to afflicted states (CARMA 9). Using three Canadian newspapers\\u2019 coverage of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami as a case study, this study seeks to answer three questions: 1. How does media coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 2. Why does coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 3. What patterns, if any, exist in disaster reporting across media organizations? 1.1 Rationale  With the changing climate, people around the world face the threat of natural disasters that are increasingly frequent, as well as increasingly devastating (Schneider 789). Bearing this in mind, how natural disasters are covered in the media should be re-evaluated and how decisions about covering these catastrophic events are made should be studied. Journalists have a responsibility to act in the public interest and must understand that this responsibility extends not only to their audiences, but also to those whose hardships and suffering they report on. There is already debate over how long natural disasters should remain on the news agenda, and journalists\\u2019 responsibility for keeping such stories there. Some argue it is inevitable that the news agenda will move on, and journalists have a responsibility to allow this to happen (International Correspondents, CNN). Others argue that the news agenda evolves through the decisions journalists and others in the media business make about what they will cover (International Correspondents, CNN). There are no easy answers to questions of how long stories   2 about even the most devastating natural disasters should remain on the news agenda. However, having a clearer understanding of the impact coverage can have on relief and recovery efforts will add a new dimension to the debate. There are also concerns that continuing coverage of natural disasters and the suffering they inflict on affected populations will lead to \\u201cconcern fatigue,\\u201d also referred to in the literature as \\u201ccompassion fatigue.\\u201d Here, the argument is that even if journalists continue to devote time to covering natural disasters over the long term, their audiences will lose interest in the topic (Robertson 8). Interest can be maintained for a longer period of time by covering natural disasters and their aftermath from new angles; however, it is unclear whether this approach also leads to concern fatigue. Based on Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge\\u2019s analysis of foreign news values, natural disasters that occur abroad are attractive options for the media to report on for two reasons: first, they evolve suddenly and often without warning, and second, they are unambiguous (Franks 283). Galtung and Ruge argue that it is straightforward, rather than complex events that tend to make international headlines, as audiences often lack the interest needed to make an effort to understand more complex foreign events (Galtung and Ruge 66). In light of this, natural disasters are an easy fill for time or space that media organizations set aside for international news.    3 2.0 Literature Review   Case studies published in academic journals across disciplines have analyzed media coverage of foreign events \\u2013 including natural disasters that occur overseas \\u2013 and compared coverage of different events and disasters in foreign media. While these case studies offer thorough explanations of what factors drive foreign events to become foreign news, answers as to why these events are covered as they are by foreign media are harder to come by.  This literature review will explore both the why and the how of foreign events becoming foreign news. As it is also the topic of this thesis project, this review will use the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami as a case study to test the ideas put forward by various academics, identify gaps in the existing literature and recommend areas for further investigation. 2.1 What Made the Tsunami \\u201cNews\\u201d?  A number of scholars have studied international news, searching for explanations of why some events taking place around the world get picked up by foreign media while others go unreported. Since the 1960s, much of this work has made reference to Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge\\u2019s study on foreign news values, which is considered a seminal piece in the field. In their study, Galtung and Ruge considered three case studies of foreign events that made their way into Western news coverage and, after careful analysis, hypothesized a list of criteria that must be met before \\u201cforeign events\\u201d become \\u201cforeign news.\\u201d They also found that foreign news values should be consistent across different cultures (Galtung and Ruge 68). As such, the values emerging from their studies of Norwegian newspapers should be applicable to the Canadian context.  Galtung and Ruge produced a long and extremely detailed list of hypotheses that account for factors such as a country\\u2019s standing in the international community, the social standing of the people involved in or affected by an event, and the type of event (positive or negative) in   4 considering which events are likely to be picked up and reported as foreign news. The hypotheses that are of greatest relevance to this thesis include the following: \\u2022 An event with a clear interpretation, free from ambiguity in its meaning, is preferred to the highly ambiguous event from which many and inconsistent implications can and will be made (Galtung and Ruge 66); \\u2022 An event that takes place over a longer time span will go unrecorded unless it reaches some kind of dramatic climax, but events that are rare or unexpected have the greatest chance of making foreign news (Galtung and Ruge 67); \\u2022 Once something has hit the headlines and been defined as news, it will continue to be defined as news for some time (Galtung and Ruge 67); \\u2022 News from culturally distant or low rank countries will have to refer to people, preferably top elite, and be preferably negative and unexpected (Galtung and Ruge 84); and \\u2022 News from culturally distant or low rank countries will also have to be simple and should, if possible, provide the reader with some sense of identification, such as a reference to the reader\\u2019s nation or group of nations (Galtung and Ruge 84). More than 40 years after Galtung and Ruge first published their study on foreign news values, scholars still tend to base their analyses on values suggested by Galtung and Ruge. Much of the literature employs these foreign news values in explaining why natural disasters like the 2004 tsunami make news abroad, citing the fact that they happen suddenly, require little explanation or contextualization, and tend to produce negative narratives. However, the literature offering a critical analysis of Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s hypotheses is underdeveloped, particularly in light of the changes the world has experienced since the 1960s. Although some scholars have examined news values associated with foreign natural disasters on a small scale (i.e. comparing and contrasting coverage of a handful of disasters), a comprehensive study of foreign news values in the new millennium has yet to be conducted.   5 Given the drastic changes that the media and society as a whole have experienced, this absence of new studies is problematic. In the Internet age, Jens Jensen argues, newspapers can publish virtually unlimited video and audio content online, and give site visitors access to hundreds of photos. According to Jensen, the birth of online journalism and the advent of participatory or citizen journalism have dramatically changed the media landscape, allowing citizens to start covering breaking stories before news organizations arrive on scene. In short, the Internet has wrought dramatic changes that Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s work could not foresee. For this reason, this literature review will consider Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s main hypotheses in light of the media environment in the 21st century, as well as other scholars\\u2019 work on the media, disaster reporting and media coverage of the 2004 tsunami. At first glance, there appears to be some inconsistency in Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s analysis of foreign news values. Natural disasters, including tsunamis, tend to strike suddenly, which Galtung and Ruge found to increase the likelihood of these events being covered as foreign news. However they are not uncommon. Each year an average of 60,000 people globally are killed by natural disasters, and another quarter of a billion people are otherwise impacted (Downman 4). According to Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s hypothesis, the routinization of deaths caused by natural disasters should decrease the likelihood of foreign media covering these stories. However, regular reading of a daily newspaper or viewing of a nightly newscast will quickly lead one to conclude that natural disasters overseas are often covered as international news. This may reflect a subtle shift in foreign news values since Galtung and Ruge first proposed their hypotheses. As technology has advanced, making it easier for news organizations to report on events abroad and for scientists to predict some types of disasters (i.e. hurricanes), the threshold a disaster must cross in order to become newsworthy may have changed. It may be that it is no longer the rarity of the disaster itself that determines its news value, but rather, the rarity of its impact. This is suggested in Philip Brown and Jessica Minty\\u2019s study of the   6 relationship between media coverage and charitable giving after the Asian tsunami. According to Brown and Minty, United Nations (UN) records counted more than a quarter of a million people killed or reported missing after the tsunami, making the scope of the disaster rather than the disaster itself a rare event (5). Based on Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s analysis of foreign news values, sweeping victims from the shores of 14 countries guaranteed the tsunami would be mentioned in most major news organizations\\u2019 coverage of world events. What Galtung and Ruge struggle to offer is a satisfactory hypothesis for the quantity of coverage devoted to a foreign news event. Their assertion that once an event has been defined as news, it will continue to be defined as news is generally accepted by other scholars as true, however the hypothesis does not adequately explain why foreign media initially devoted so much coverage to the tsunami. After the tsunami, CNN alone deployed more than 80 anchors, correspondents and producers to Southeast Asia in order to provide round-the-clock coverage of the disaster (Brown and Minty 5). In their analysis of foreign news values, Galtung and Ruge seem to have overlooked what most scholars recognize as a core news value in any type of reporting: timing. When the tsunami struck on December 26th, 2004, many governments around the world were in recess and most major corporations were operating at reduced capacity over the holiday period. Due to the timing of the disaster, the tsunami faced considerably less competition for limited column inches and broadcast time than it would at virtually any other time of year. Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s hypotheses on foreign news values also, in large part, fail to explain the duration of the media\\u2019s tsunami coverage. One study of American media coverage found that peaks in tsunami coverage occurred on December 30th, 2004 and January 4th, February 1st, February 19th, March 8th, March 26th and March 28th, 2005 (Brown and Minty 6). The duration of this coverage is unusual and cannot be explained by Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s analysis. To understand   7 why the media continued to devote so much coverage to the tsunami throughout the post-disaster recovery period, one must consider Peter Vasterman\\u2019s work on so-called \\u201cmedia-hype.\\u201d In a 2005 study, Vasterman noted the existence of \\u201cpositive feedback loops,\\u201d in which the media begins by offering regular news coverage of an event, during which journalists report facts and offer analysis. After a while, the event or topic is seen as less newsworthy and media attention will diminish and start to shift elsewhere. However, there are some events, such as the tsunami, which prompt media coverage to continue independent of how stories are (or are not) unfolding. When this occurs, Vasterman argues, a theme begins to develop in news coverage and the threshold of newsworthiness is lowered for events and stories that can be tied to that theme. Even after coverage of a theme has gone into decline, the threshold for newsworthiness remains lowered, allowing for coverage to extend even further (Vasterman 515). However, though Vasterman\\u2019s work offers an explanation for the duration of tsunami coverage by foreign media, his analysis does not explain the peaks in coverage that occurred through March 2005 \\u2013 three months after the tsunami struck. For that, one must return to Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s study of foreign news values. Galtung and Ruge posited that news from countries that are culturally distant or of low rank in the international community must refer to elites, be negative or unexpected, or allow an audience to identify with the story. This hypothesis was proven to hold true some 40 years later when a study by Brown and Minty identified peaks in tsunami coverage and cross-referenced those peaks with events happening at the time. With the exception of the March 26th peak \\u2013 which resulted from media organizations commemorating the three-month anniversary of the disaster \\u2013 Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s hypotheses account for every peak found in American coverage of the tsunami. On December 30th, 2004, American donations to relief efforts were reaching unprecedented levels and were expected to climb further after the federal Tsunami Disaster and Tax Relief Act extended the deadline for   8 tax-deductible charitable donations from the traditional December 31st deadline through until January 31st (Brown and Minty 6). Americans\\u2019 unexpected outpouring of generosity generated numerous stories, boosting the amount of coverage devoted to tsunami-related stories. Unexpected events also account for the March 28th peak, when American media reported on an 8.7 magnitude earthquake that shook the area near the epicenter of the earthquake responsible for causing the Boxing Day tsunami. Meanwhile, elites were tied to peaks on January 4th (when Secretary of State Colin Powell visited affected areas), February 1st (when former President Bill Clinton was appointed as a special American envoy to South Asia), and March 8th (when Clinton and former President George H.W. Bush briefed President George W. Bush on the disaster). Finally, the February 19th peak coincided with the publication of vacation photos taken by a Canadian couple that died in the tsunami \\u2013 victims that an American audience could identify with in terms of both culture and geography (Brown and Minty 6). Overall, many of the hypotheses about foreign news values that Galtung and Ruge first proposed in 1965 still appear to apply more than 40 years later. That is not to say, however, that scholars should wait another 40 years before re-examining foreign news values. Although there is evidence to support the continuing validity of Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s work, a more comprehensive study is still necessary to understand how a more mobile global population, the Internet, citizen journalism and other realities of the 21st century have impacted modern foreign news values. This thesis project will examine the quantity and duration of coverage, and the threshold for \\u201cnewsworthy\\u201d stories in the Canadian print media\\u2019s coverage of the 2004 tsunami. However, more general analyses of foreign news values and the role of the Internet in tsunami coverage are beyond the scope of this project.     9 2.2 What Factors Shaped News Coverage of the Tsunami?  How the media covers an event is as important as what the media chooses to cover. However, in some instances \\u2013 for example, immediately after a natural disaster \\u2013 how media organizations operate inside the disaster zone may actually be more important than the stories they pursue. This, arguably, may be doubly so in the case of a foreign media organization covering a natural disaster. In a 1997 study, Penelope Ploughman analyzed newspaper coverage of seven disasters \\u2013 both natural and technological (man-made) \\u2013 and found the common belief that, \\u201cdisasters provoke widespread community breakdown, including panic, flight, looting, psychological dependency and shock,\\u201d is not rooted in fact (121). Rather, Ploughman concluded, \\u201crationality and altruism tend to prevail and most [people] respond in ways designed to restore normality\\u201d (121). However the media, she concluded, generally does not. The situations tsunami-affected states encountered as foreign journalists streamed into the disaster zone after the tsunami lend support to Ploughman\\u2019s findings. In a presentation to the 2005 Journalism Education Conference at Griffith University, Scott Downman stated that many media organizations do not have clear policies on covering natural disasters abroad. Moreover, Downman noted, relatively inexperienced crews are often dispatched to report on foreign disasters before questions about what they will eat, where they will sleep and how they will file stories can be answered (4). An influx of foreign journalists ill- prepared to function independently in a post-disaster environment can add to the demand for scarce basic resources like food, safe drinking water, shelter and medical care, as well as luxuries like electricity and telephone access that may be vital to rescue and recovery efforts (Downman 4). This, Downman concluded, was the case in much of Southeast Asia and especially the Indonesian city of Banda Aceh in the days and weeks following the disaster.   10 After the tsunami, organizations like the International News Safety Institute (INSI) issued guidelines for journalists headed to affected areas. The INSI recommendations were straightforward, and included such common sense suggestions as all journalists ensuring their vaccinations were up-to-date and that they traveled with a first aid kit complete with sterile needles, insect repellant, painkillers, and basic antibiotics. But Downman\\u2019s study found that many journalists arrived in Banda Aceh without clean food or water, money, laptops or satellite phones and without local language skills or a translator (9). In fact, he reported that some arrived with only a credit card, expecting to purchase the necessary supplies inside the disaster zone (Downman 9). Many of those journalists who arrived unprepared became dependent on aid agencies for basic supplies and scrounged the resources needed to file stories from local media organizations, many of which had been devastated by the tsunami (Downman 13). Ultimately, Downman concluded that the presence of so many journalists in devastated areas \\u2013 especially Indonesia\\u2019s Banda Aceh \\u2013 hindered relief efforts. Downman attributes the phenomenon of journalists flocking to Southeast Asia, unprepared for the conditions they would have to operate in, to the fact that many affected areas were easily accessible to journalists. That is, these areas were geographically close to places where many journalists were already stationed to cover foreign news, and flights into the disaster zone were relatively cheap (Downman 5). However, this conclusion fails to explain why a handful of organizations, such as Reuters \\u2013 a world renowned news organization with journalists permanently stationed around the globe \\u2013 adhered to their existing policies, insisting that all their journalists traveling to the disaster zone complete an extensive training course on how to be self- sufficient in the field prior to departure (Downman 11). Downman\\u2019s findings fail to take into consideration how the foreign reporting experience and reputations of the news organizations represented by journalists traveling to a disaster zone might impact the area. His findings also   11 leave the question of why so many foreign journalists traveled to tsunami-affected areas unanswered. Alternate explanations also fail to provide satisfactory answers. In a 1998 study of television news coverage of disasters, Tamar Liebes posited that media organizations can resist participating in marathon-length coverage of a natural disaster (73). However, he determined that professional norms, journalists\\u2019 perceptions about their roles in democratic society, and the economic pressures on decision makers in the newsroom have a tendency to pressure journalists into devoting a great deal of coverage to natural disasters (Liebes 73). In a more recent study of media-hype across mediums, Vasterman offered a similar explanation, noting that editors are pressured to report on any number of events because their competition is doing so, because there may be consequences or implications for important public figures, or \\u2013 as was the case after the tsunami \\u2013 because the news wave of related stories is itself a story (509). As the other two factors have already been discussed elsewhere in this literature review, the potential impact a story may have on public figures will be considered here. Not long after the tsunami struck, coverage of the humanitarian side of the disaster started decreasing and some media organizations began running stories that focused on the impact decisions related to tsunami relief and recovery would have on politicians not in affected areas, but in the West. For example, in early January, one Canadian newspaper reported on a CNN prediction that, \\u201cthe [George W.] Bush administration\\u2019s efforts to stop the growth of Islamic terrorist organizations in Southeast Asia would suffer a setback because shadowy terrorist groups would use the chaos and confusion to further their nefarious ends\\u201d (Doyle R2). Just two days later, the same paper ran a story about the balancing act Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin was performing by offering aid money to Sri Lanka while insisting that none of this money was reaching the Tamil Tigers, a group recognized as a terrorist organization by the UN and some of Canada\\u2019s allies (Wong and Campbell A1). Both the Bush and Martin governments   12 were left in difficult positions after the tsunami, as were countless other public figures whose decisions about relief and recovery efforts in Southeast Asia may potentially have had serious implications for the survival of affected people, as well as terrorism and ongoing conflict in the region. These dilemmas, and their potential consequences in future elections, may explain why there was so much media coverage of Western governments\\u2019 responses to the tsunami. However, while these circumstances may explain why journalists flocked to cover the tsunami, they still do not adequately explain why foreign journalists flocked to Southeast Asia. Evidently, there is still analysis that must be done on this topic, as the existing literature falls short of offering satisfactory answers. The Western focus of much foreign reporting on the tsunami raises another interesting question, namely why so many Western politicians fed the news cycle with tsunami-related stories. A 2006 report by the global media analysis firm CARMA International analyzing media coverage of six natural and humanitarian disasters, including the Southeast Asian tsunami, may offer some insight into this. CARMA International found that the amount of coverage devoted to a humanitarian disaster is, in fact, tied to the political capital \\u2013 such as voter support at home or support for an initiative to be presented to the international community \\u2013 to be gained from the disaster (9). From a political perspective, the organization identified two uses that humanitarian disasters may be put to: the disaster can either be used to fuel an ongoing debate (the \\u201cgrist to the mill\\u201d approach) or used to serve the national interest (the \\u201cstrategic\\u201d approach) (CARMA 9). In the grist to the mill approach, CARMA found that both the media and politicians downplay the humanitarian dimensions of a crisis, and the focus is instead shifted to the political arguments being made (9). This claim is supported by the content analysis conducted for this thesis project, which found that Canadian newspapers focused on the humanitarian aspect of the disaster immediately following the tsunami, but soon began shifting their tsunami coverage to focus on more contentious issues, such as aid and recovery.   13 Under CARMA\\u2019s criteria, this would indicate that coverage of the tsunami performed a strategic rather than persuasive function in Canada. This strategic function may explain why so many politicians made themselves available to the media for post-tsunami stories: politicians are able to drive coverage of a disaster, but they will only do so in order to serve their own interests (CARMA 7). But what interest did politicians have in perpetuating the flood of tsunami-related stories? Vasterman\\u2019s media-hype study offers an answer: an expansion of the definition of a problem, resulting in the broadening of the scope of a problem as news organizations engage in thematic reporting (517). In some post-tsunami reporting, however, the theme was not the tsunami, as one might expect. Rather terrorism \\u2013 a theme of much greater and longer lasting interest to Western politicians since the September 11th attacks \\u2013 was being re-visited by the media. While Vasterman and CARMA can explain why a steady flow of public figures were willing to speak to the media to push their political agendas on other issues in the wake of the tsunami, neither study explains why the media chose to run terrorism-themed stories. To understand that, one must return to Ploughman\\u2019s study of the credibility hierarchy after a disaster. As other scholars have noted, Ploughman found that patterns in the distribution of social power and prestige are reflected in the selection of what is news. These patterns create a so-called credibility hierarchy, in which credibility is defined as both the right to be heard and the perceived importance of the view being expressed (Ploughman 119). According to Ploughman, the government is usually the dominant newsmaker after a disaster, largely because it has control over information about the disaster, as well as relief and recovery efforts, and because it has so many resources at its disposal in terms of manpower, expert knowledge and equipment (119). After examining media coverage of seven different disasters, Ploughman concluded that in disaster reporting, the media relies upon the established credibility hierarchy, particularly governments from their places at the top of the hierarchy, to determine the salience   14 of issues and set the agenda for social and political discourse on those issues (120). To date, there has been little written about citizen journalism\\u2019s place in this hierarchy, or its impact. Clearly scholars have found many factors that work together to shape media coverage of an event. But many questions remain unanswered in the existing literature. Further research is needed to explore issues such as whether reporting on individual natural disasters is itself part of a broader theme, such as climate change, if these broader themes determine which natural disasters are covered by foreign media or how these disasters are covered, and how the advent of citizen journalism, which empowers eyewitnesses to break news as governments are mobilizing, has impacted foreign disaster reporting. Some of these questions will be addressed in this thesis project, employing the 2004 tsunami as a case study of the Canadian print media\\u2019s disaster reporting practices. However, a more thorough investigation of these issues is required if the ideas and theories in the literature on these and other subjects are to keep pace with the realities facing journalism in the 21st century. 2.3 Summary  Many academics have studied issues that are relevant to this thesis, ranging from everyday reporting to reporting on natural disasters, and from foreign news values to the motivations of various actors involved in media coverage of a disaster. All of these avenues of research have made valuable contributions towards understanding why and how foreign events become foreign news. However, a number of questions remain unanswered, and new questions are arising as journalism grapples with technological and social change in the 21st century. Media coverage of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami offers insights into foreign news and disaster reporting in the age of globalization, the Internet and citizen journalism. Yet as a case study, it   15 also serves as a cautionary tale, warning of the potential dangers if knowledge and best practices fail to keep pace with change.   16 3.0 Research Method  This thesis project focuses on print media and consists of a content analysis of three Canadian newspapers over the three months immediately following the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami. 3.1 Research Questions  1. How does media coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 2. Why does media coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 3. What patterns, if any, exist in disaster reporting across media organizations? 3.2 Design and Data Sources  The data collected for this analysis was drawn from a content analysis of three Canadian newspapers. The project compares local coverage with national coverage of the tsunami, considering coverage in the Vancouver Sun, the Globe and Mail, and the National Post over the three-month period immediately following the tsunami (December 27th, 2004 \\u2013 March 31st, 2005). Building upon the methodology Alexa Robertson established in her 2008 content analysis of American television coverage of the tsunami, the relevant print content is coded as follows: \\u2022 Number of stories; \\u2022 Length of stories, by word count; \\u2022 Presentation of stories. All stories are classified as either text only, text and photo, or photo only; \\u2022 Framing of stories. All stories are coded into one of five categories, including four identified by Robertson (\\u201chuman\\u201d, \\u201cpolitical\\u201d, \\u201caid\\u201d and \\u201cother\\u201d), and one new category created for the purpose of this research project (\\u201crecovery\\u201d). Stories that contained   17 elements of more than one category were assigned to the category that reflected the greatest emphasis of the story. \\u2022 Location of story. Stories are allocated to one of three categories based upon where they appear in the newspaper: front page, front of section, or inside pages. The data in each category is presented day by day in order to study changes in each publication\\u2019s coverage over the three-month period. 3.3 Data Analysis  The data collected for the content analysis was drawn from editions of the Vancouver Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail published between December 27th, 2004 and March 31st, 2005. In the cases of the National Post and the Globe and Mail, which publish national editions as well as editions targeted at major metropolitan areas, like Toronto, the national editions were analyzed. This was done to ensure consistency in the content analysis, which looks at newspaper coverage available to readers living in Vancouver. Each newspaper is published six days a week (Monday through Saturday). The tsunami occurred on Sunday December 26th so print coverage of the tsunami did not begin until December 27th in all three newspapers. During the content analysis, broad themes emerged and the data were subsequently organized accordingly. Those themes were the newsworthiness of the tsunami, the scale of the event, the media agenda at the time the tsunami struck, and the emotional impact of the tsunami.   18 4.0 Findings  This section reports on the data collected during the content analysis. 4.1 Quantity of Coverage   In the days immediately following the tsunami, the three newspapers studied for this thesis provided their readers with extensive coverage of the disaster (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1: Number of Stories Published, By Date   All three newspapers returned from a non-publishing day on December 26th with modest coverage of the events unfolding half a world away. As the week immediately following the disaster unfolded, however, the amount of coverage increased dramatically. The most noticeable increase occurred in the Globe and Mail\\u2019s coverage, which peaked on January 6th and 8th. On   19 both days, the newspaper ran a total of 31 stories related to the tsunami. From then on, the quantity of stories each of the three newspapers printed on a day-to-day basis were approximately the same. The exception to this was on February 12th, when the National Post ran a total of 24 tsunami stories, by far surpassing the amount of coverage offered by the other two newspapers. Coverage of the tsunami began to decline in all three newspapers between January 10th and 12th. In terms of the word count that each of the three newspapers devoted to their coverage, peaks occurred within the first two weeks after the tsunami struck (see Fig. 2). The first to peak was the National Post, which ran a total of 12,335 words about the tsunami on January 4th, 10 days after the disaster. The Globe and Mail and the Vancouver Sun both peaked four days later, on January 8th, when they ran 23,780 words and 15,820 words, respectively. Following these highs, the average word count devoted to tsunami stories through the remainder of the study period dropped for all three newspapers. The Vancouver Sun averaged 2,412 words per day across the study period, dropping to 1,283 words per day after the peak. Meanwhile, the Globe and Mail dropped from an average of 3,531 words per day to 1,392 words after the peak, and the National Post dropped from an average of 2,315 to 1,544 words per day.            20 Fig. 2: Number of Words Published, By Date   However, simply considering average word counts does not give an accurate sense of the amount of coverage each newspaper devoted to the tsunami. This is particularly true in the case of the National Post. The newspaper\\u2019s February 12th spike to 9,505 words of tsunami coverage artificially inflates the newspaper\\u2019s average word count for the post-peak period. Had this second spike in coverage not occurred, the National Post would, in all likelihood, have offered the least coverage of the tsunami in terms of post-peak word count. Had the newspaper run 1,400 words that day (similar to the 1,402 words it printed on the following day), its average post-peak word count per day would have dropped to 1,270, placing it behind both the Globe and Mail and the Vancouver Sun. This raises questions about why one national newspaper would offer more coverage of the tsunami than a local paper, and so much more coverage than another national paper.   21 Interestingly, in only one case did a newspaper\\u2019s peak in word count fall on the same day as the peak in the number of photographs the newspaper published. For the Globe and Mail, the peak day for printing both photographs and text was January 8th, when a total of 28 photographs (see Fig. 3) ran with the newspaper\\u2019s 31 tsunami stories. In comparison, the National Post ran a high of 22 photographs (and 12 stories) on December 28th, making it the first newspaper to peak in photographic coverage of the tsunami. The Vancouver Sun was the last to peak in visual coverage, running a total of 17 photographs (and 14 stories) on January 15th. Fig. 3: Number of Photos Published, By Date  4.2 Framing of Coverage  By mid-January, according to various stories published in the three newspapers considered in this analysis, estimates of the numbers of dead and missing had stabilized. Most of the Canadians affected by the tsunami had already been located and either reunited with their   22 families or memorialized on the pages of these newspapers. In Canada, the focus had shifted, just as it had on the ground in Southeast Asia, to reconstruction and recovery efforts. This shift was reflected in the pages of Canadian newspapers (see Fig. 4, 5 and 6), where stories about aid and the politics inherent in supporting reconstruction and recovery began to appear more frequently. Fig. 4: Story Framing in Vancouver Sun, By Date   23  Fig. 5: Story Framing in National Post, By Date  Fig. 6: Story Framing in Globe and Mail, By Date   24 4.2.1 Political Stories  Stories assigned to this category dealt with actions and responses by the Canadian government, foreign governments or other authorities (i.e. the United Nations).  Tsunami stories considered political appeared for the first time on the same date \\u2013 December 30th \\u2013 in all three newspapers. The stories themselves, however were presented somewhat differently. The Vancouver Sun reported that Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew and International Cooperation Minister Aileen Carroll were both cutting their holidays short and returning to Canada to coordinate the country\\u2019s response to the tsunami, and noted that Prime Minister Paul Martin would not be returning from his own holiday until later in the week (Curry A7). Despite the prime minister\\u2019s absence, the story made it clear that Defence Minister Bill Graham and Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh were both in Ottawa, coordinating the federal government\\u2019s response to the disaster and staying in close contact with Martin, Pettigrew and Carroll (Curry A7). The Globe and Mail and the National Post, however, focused more on the criticism surrounding Martin\\u2019s decision not to return earlier. The National Post\\u2019s story was perhaps the most political of the three, running the story on its front page under the headline \\u201cMartin on holiday, Tories say people \\u2018ashamed to be Canadian\\u2019\\u201d (Sokoloff and Curry A1). These stories were the first of many on what would eventually become a theme in the Canadian media\\u2019s tsunami coverage: criticizing the federal government\\u2019s response to the disaster. 4.2.2 Recovery Stories  Stories assigned to this category focused on rehabilitating survivors, rebuilding homes, repairing infrastructure, long-term programs and projects sponsored by foreign governments, and long-term projects and programs sponsored by other authorities (i.e. the United Nations). Where the three newspapers differed greatly was in their coverage of recovery stories. The Globe and Mail was the first to publish a recovery story, running a piece on December 29th \\u2013   25 one day before publishing its first political story \\u2013 highlighting the financial challenges that tsunami affected countries would face as they rebuilt (Pitts B1). Two days later \\u2013 on December 31st \\u2013 the National Post published its first recovery story, focusing on tourists returning to a popular Thai beach even as clean-up efforts continued further down the shore (Wordsworth A13). The last of the three newspapers to turn its attention to recovery was the Vancouver Sun. It was not until January 10th that the first recovery story appeared in the newspaper, highlighting some coastal Thai villagers\\u2019 fears of losing their land to developers after the tsunami cleared their homes off prime, beachfront property (\\u201cThais fear losing their land to developers\\u201d A13). 4.2.3 Human Stories  Stories assigned to the \\u201chuman\\u201d category focused on identifying the dead, saving the injured, locating missing persons, controlling the spread of disease among survivors, aiding traumatized survivors and helping foreign citizens return home. The Vancouver Sun was the first to stop daily publication of human stories. The Vancouver Sun continued to run human stories daily until January 14th, while the National Post and the Globe and Mail both ceased to print daily human stories as of January 15th. In light of the types of human stories that were being covered by each newspaper, the reason for at least the Vancouver Sun\\u2019s change in focus can be easily explained.  The two national newspapers tended to focus on human stories more broadly, publishing tales about victims, immigration and refugee policy decisions made by governments around the world by way of the people they impacted, and Canadians impacted by the tsunami, either as victims or as workers involved in rescue and recovery efforts. The Vancouver Sun\\u2019s coverage of human stories generally had a narrower focus, keeping readers apprised of the situation of British Columbians in Southeast Asia when the tsunami hit and in the immediate aftermath. On January 12th, the Vancouver Sun reported the body of the final missing British Columbian the newspaper   26 had been chronicling had been positively identified (Baglole A1). Although other stories with local connections emerged throughout the remainder of the three-month period being studied, the confirmed death of Richmond resident Rubina Wong effectively ended one of the last local human narratives the newspaper had been following. From January 13th onward, the Vancouver Sun\\u2019s human stories tended to focus on the health risks facing survivors and what Canada\\u2019s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was doing to combat these risks. Survivor stories also continued to appear periodically, though much less frequently than in the days immediately following the tsunami.  Throughout the remainder of January and well into February, dramatic human stories continued to unfold around the world. Both national newspapers covered the Baby 81 saga in detail (Tran A1) and, like the Vancouver Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail continued to publish stories about the many health risks threatening tsunami survivors, and Canada\\u2019s involvement in initiatives and programs to mitigate them. On January 21st, after the Indonesian government raised its estimated death toll by 50,000, bringing the total dead in that country alone to 166,000, the Globe and Mail covered the revision (Dillon A17). The next day, after the British government announced it would issue death certificates for all 550 of its citizens still unaccounted for, the National Post reported on the decision (\\u201cBritish to issue death certificates for missing tsunami victims\\u201d A15). From this date on, both the National Post and the Globe and Mail began to scale back their coverage of the human stories emerging from the disaster. 4.2.4 Aid Stories  Stories assigned to this category focused on charitable donations from private citizens, foreign aid offered by governments (including offers of financial, material and human resources), and logistical problems in delivering aid to tsunami-affected areas.   27  Perhaps the most striking thing about pieces classified as aid stories in this analysis was the narrative of Western generosity that emerged within this theme. The front page of the Globe and Mail on December 31st read, \\u201cCanadian donors \\u2018amaze\\u2019,\\u201d and went on to note that private donations were on track to beat the $40 million of aid the federal government had already pledged to tsunami relief (Vallis and Suhanic A1). Almost a week later, the Globe and Mail printed a front page story with the headline, \\u201cDonors swamp charities\\u201d (Alphonso A1), while the National Post\\u2019s front page included the headline, \\u201cWorld aid for victims hit \\u2018incredible\\u2019\\u201d (Wordsworth A1). By January 15th, the Vancouver Sun was reporting, \\u201cUnited Way drive nets record $30.2m\\u201d (Wilson B1). Some of the headlines were so euphoric, it almost seemed as if the three newspapers were competing to publish the most self-congratulatory story.  Some of the aid stories published in the first few weeks after the tsunami profiled specific donors. These stories focused on celebrities and sports icons, as well as unique characters doing their bit to raise money for tsunami relief. The Vancouver Sun introduced its readers to a group of local Buddhists offering to sell a temple and donate the proceeds to relief efforts (Todd A1). The newspaper followed up on the story when the sale of that temple resulted in a $500,000 donation (Todd A4). The National Post reported on a Calgary Zoo elephant whose paintings were sold to raise $6,300 for tsunami relief (\\u201cKamala, the Calgary Zoo elephant, raises $6,300 for tsunami relief\\u201d A5), and a group of homeless alcoholics in Denmark who raised $3,400 to protest their government\\u2019s initial \\u201cstingy\\u201d donation of $1.8 million (\\u201cHomeless Danish alcoholics do their bit for tsunami relief, raising $3,400\\u201d A13). These stories highlighting the generosity of individual donors generally fed into a broader narrative of Western generosity after the tsunami.  That is not to say, however, that all aid stories painted Western generosity in a positive light. On January 11th, the Globe and Mail published a pair of front page stories under the headline, \\u201cFederal tsunami aid hits $425-million\\u2026 as cash woes hurt African AIDS fight,\\u201d   28 highlighting how short donors\\u2019 attention spans can be, and how quickly they can forget about a particular crisis once a more dramatic one comes along (Nolen A1 and Mahoney and Leblanc A1). One week later, a Vancouver Sun article urged, \\u201cLet\\u2019s stop patting ourselves on the back and face reality,\\u201d in which the author opined that the Canadian tsunami response, \\u201csmacks of a feel-good effort by well-intentioned people,\\u201d but that more serious, concerted efforts were needed for tsunami recovery to succeed (Campbell D3). As time wore on, all three newspapers also criticized the federal government\\u2019s decision to send aid money to Sri Lanka, despite concerns that at least some of this aid would be diverted to support the Tamil Tigers, a group recognized by the UN and some of Canada\\u2019s allies as a terrorist organization (Wong and Clark A1). These types of stories, offering a more critical view of the so-called \\u201caid tsunami,\\u201d tended to emerge later in the study period, at approximately the same time that human stories were disappearing from daily coverage of the disaster. 4.2.5 \\u201cOther\\u201d Stories  The \\u201cother\\u201d category employed in this study was initially created to be a general category for stories that did not fit into the more strictly defined thematic categories. However, as the analysis progressed, eleven distinct categories emerged out of the stories classed as \\u201cother,\\u201d and several noticeable differences were observed across the three newspapers (see Fig. 7). As a result, the \\u201cother\\u201d category is worth exploring in greater detail.    29  Fig. 7:  Framing of \\u201cOther\\u201d Stories, By Publication   This analysis includes a total of 205 \\u201cother\\u201d stories: 89 from the Globe and Mail, 62 from the Vancouver Sun and 54 from the National Post. Stories falling within the \\u201cother\\u201d category have been assigned to the following sub-categories: tsunami threat to Western countries, science, information (i.e. stories containing contact information for updates about the situation in the countries hit by the tsunami), economic, threat mitigation (i.e. stories about national and regional early warning systems), environment (i.e. stories about the tsunami\\u2019s impact on wildlife), memorial (stories about vigils and obituaries for tsunami victims), travel, crime (i.e. stories about donation thefts and scams), conflict (i.e. stories about how the tsunami has impacted ongoing conflicts in parts of Sri Lanka and Indonesia), and media.    30 4.2.5.1 Tsunami Threat to Western Countries Stories  During the three-month period considered in this analysis, the Vancouver Sun printed twice the number of stories as the Globe and Mail on the threat tsunamis pose to Western countries, and four times as many of these stories as the National Post. This may reflect the fact that the Vancouver Sun caters to an audience in a coastal locale, while the two national newspapers write for audiences that are mostly landlocked. As early as December 27th (the first publication day after the tsunami), the Vancouver Sun published a story in which a scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada explained that British Columbia shares many of Southeast Asia\\u2019s tsunami risk factors, and when \\u2013 \\u201cnot if,\\u201d the expert stressed \\u2013 a \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d earthquake strikes, coastal communities like Tofino and Port Alberni could be \\u201cseriously affected\\u201d by the resulting tsunami (Ward A10). Later stories explored what would happen if a tsunami struck British Columbia, how well prepared the province was to respond to a tsunami, and what happened when a tsunami struck off Port Alberni in 1964 (Boei A6). The Globe and Mail\\u2019s stories also dealt mostly with the tsunami threat facing British Columbia\\u2019s coast, including the perceived threat motivating 14 of the province\\u2019s First Nations communities to seek assistance from the federal and provincial governments in moving at risk houses to higher ground (Hume A1). The National Post printed just one story about the west coast\\u2019s insufficient tsunami-warning system (Blackwell A1) and one about the likelihood of the country\\u2019s east coast being hit by a tsunami, as it was in 1929 (\\u201cAtlantic Canada has been hit by a tsunami before, and it will be hit again: Expert\\u201d A8). 4.2.5.2 Science Stories   The same reasoning may be applied to explain why the Vancouver Sun ran more science stories than either of the national papers. All three newspapers published general, informational stories about the science of how an earthquake can trigger a tsunami, and how the earthquake   31 that created the Southeast Asian tsunami altered the rotation of the Earth. However, the Vancouver Sun delved deeper into explaining why coastal areas of British Columbia \\u2013 particularly Richmond, on the mainland, and Port Alberni, on Vancouver Island \\u2013 would be vulnerable to a tsunami if a large enough earthquake ever rocked the area. Presumably, given that the majority of their readers live inland and therefore are not likely to ever find their lives threatened by a tsunami, the National Post and the Globe and Mail were less interested in educating their readers about the science behind specific tsunami threats facing coastal Canadians. 4.2.5.3 Travel Stories  Also noteworthy is the slightly greater emphasis the Globe and Mail and the National Post placed on travel stories compared to the Vancouver Sun in the three months following the tsunami. Considering the city\\u2019s reputation as a so-called \\u201cgateway to the Pacific\\u201d, one might have expected the Vancouver Sun to publish at least as many travel stories as the two national newspapers. However, some areas of Southeast Asia hard hit by the tsunami were popular destinations for Western tourists, including people from all across Canada (Sokoloff A1). In light of this, it seems that the newspapers judged Canadians across the country and not just those living in the country\\u2019s \\u201cgateway to the Pacific\\u201d to have an interest in stories about post-tsunami travel to Southeast Asia. 4.2.5.4 Basic Information Stories  Interestingly, the National Post was the only newspaper considered in this study not to publish stories containing basic information, including where people could call for specific information regarding each of the countries impacted by the tsunami. This is curious, as these types of stories can be prepared quite quickly and, in some sense, fulfill the audience-informing role of the newspaper at its most basic level. This raises questions about what the National Post   32 envisioned its role as being in the aftermath of the tsunami, and how that vision might differ if covering a domestic rather than a foreign disaster. 4.2.5.5 Conflict Stories  Also noteworthy are the discrepancies in the number of conflict stories published across the three newspapers. These types of stories largely addressed decades old conflicts in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and how the devastation wrought by the tsunami impacted the prospects for peace in both countries. These stories have periodically made it into Canadian newspapers, so it is not why these stories appeared after the tsunami, but rather why these stories appeared in some newspapers more frequently than others that deserves closer consideration. At first glance, it may be tempting to attribute the Vancouver Sun\\u2019s minimal coverage of conflict stories to the city\\u2019s relatively small diaspora populations of Sri Lankans and Indonesians. It might seem as though the national newspapers were catering to diaspora audiences, however, in both instances, the diaspora communities are largely concentrated in Toronto. This raises questions about why conflict stories appeared so often in the national editions of the Globe and Mail and the National Post, rather than in the Toronto editions of the newspapers. 4.2.5.6 Media Stories  Perhaps the most noticeable difference across the three newspapers is that the Globe and Mail alone published pieces about the media\\u2019s coverage of the tsunami. These stories covered a range of issues, including the ethnic media\\u2019s role in providing coverage, decisions around publishing disaster images, and critical reflections on overall media coverage of the tsunami. These stories are particularly interesting in the context of this study, as they suggest that some of the questions considered in this analysis were, in fact, being raised in the newsroom during the study period.   33 4.3 Location of Stories  Analyzing where tsunami stories were published also offers insight into some interesting differences between newspapers. Not surprisingly, the front pages of all three newspapers carried tsunami stories for days after the waves washed ashore. The first paper to drop the tsunami from its front page was the Vancouver Sun (see Fig. 8), which, on January 1st published a total of 14 stories: 13 on its inside pages, and one front of section story comprised of assorted Internet postings from survivors and people searching for information about missing friends and family (\\u201cLost in paradise\\u201d C1). Four days later, on January 5th, the National Post (see Fig. 9) published a story about the tsunami\\u2019s impact on Manulife\\u2019s Asian operations on the front of its FP section, and scattered 22 other tsunami stories across its inside pages (Dabrowski FP1). It was not until January 15th that the Globe and Mail (see Fig. 10) followed suit, bumping coverage from its front page and running all eight tsunami stories on its inside pages. For the remainder of the three- month period of this study, tsunami stories would periodically run on the front pages of all three newspapers, however they would not dominate the front pages as they had in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.   34  Fig. 8: Location of Stories in Vancouver Sun, By Date  Fig. 9: Location of Stories in National Post, By Date   35  Fig. 10: Location of Stories in Globe and Mail, By Date  Even on March 26th, the three-month anniversary of the disaster, tsunami coverage ran on the inside pages of all three newspapers. On this day, the National Post published both of its tsunami stories in the A section (pages A9 and A18), while the Vancouver Sun ran its stories on pages C9 and J4, and the Globe and Mail ran one story on page A12 and published the other two on pages T5 and T6. It seems that by March, all three newspapers had largely lost interest in the tsunami story. The Vancouver Sun and the National Post did publish tsunami stores on their front pages one final time during the study period. On March 28th, the Vancouver Sun ran a piece critical of the Canadian government\\u2019s dispersal of aid for tsunami ravaged countries (Eaves A1), and on March 29th, the National Post reported on an 8.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sumatra, sparking fears that another tsunami would hit the area (Stinson   36 A1). However, these stories dealt with the tsunami only peripherally. They were more focused on new events related to the disaster and not on the disaster itself.   37 5.0 Discussion   This section explores some of the issues raised in the content analysis in greater detail and offers analysis of the findings. 5.1 Quantity of Coverage   As noted in the previous section, on February 12th, the National Post published a total of 24 stories about the tsunami. The discussion offered in this section will focus on that edition of the National Post. This spike in the National Post\\u2019s coverage was anomalous, as it appeared on a day when both the Vancouver Sun and the Globe and Mail\\u2019s coverage had dropped off to just a single tsunami story. Moreover, that single story in both newspapers dealt with the tsunami only indirectly. Both carried the news that the World Press Photo of the Year honour had been awarded to Reuters\\u2019 Arko Datta for his photograph of an Indian woman mourning beside the body of a relative killed in the tsunami (\\u201cTsunami image captures world: Devastating loss to killer waves top picture of 2004\\u201d A17). In contrast, the National Post\\u2019s coverage ranged from survivors\\u2019 stories (\\u201cBravery on the Beach\\u201d A20) to the impact of the tsunami on Southeast Asia and the West alike (\\u201cIt was the West\\u2019s window\\u201d A14), and from outlining overseas suspicions about American motives for offering aid (Manthorpe A25) to the story of Britain\\u2019s 10 year-old Tilly Smith, whose science class taught her to recognize the early warning signs of a tsunami and enabled her to clear the entire beach her family was vacationing on before the deadly wave washed ashore (\\u201cSchoolgirl deserves an A+\\u201d A22). In light of this, there may appear to have been no reason for the spike in the National Post\\u2019s coverage on February 12th. There was not, judging from other media coverage, a wealth of new information coming out of Southeast Asia at this time. It seems that rather than merely allowing the flow of information out of the region to dictate the amount of coverage it devoted to   38 the tsunami, the National Post decided to make the disaster a major focus for its February 12th edition. On that day, the newspaper printed stories recapping statistics about the disaster, including the magnitude of the earthquake that triggered the tsunami, the speed of the waves that swept people away, and the estimated national death tolls from the disaster. It also delved deeper into stories like the \\u201cBaby 81\\u201d saga \\u2013 the tale of a three-month old survivor identified by nine different couples as the son they saw swept away when the tsunami struck \\u2013 and introduced readers to additional characters involved in the custody drama playing out in Sri Lanka, even though there was not any new information to report (\\u201cThe fierce love of parents\\u201d A23). Finally, the newspaper seems to have used its February 12th edition to publish pieces that had been filed earlier but had not, for whatever reason, made it to print, including a story about how the Indian government was coping with relief and recovery independently after refusing to accept international aid (\\u201cThe nation that refused aid\\u201d A11). This spike in the National Post\\u2019s coverage is significant because it demonstrates that the newspaper is both able and willing to act independently of unfolding events, at least some of the time. The content analysis hints that the National Post decided to focus its February 12th edition on the tsunami and its victims, disproportionate to the amount of new information coming out of Southeast Asia. This has serious implications, particularly for newspapers covering natural disasters and other types of humanitarian emergencies. It seems to suggest that, given the right circumstances, newspapers \\u2013 and indeed this may be true for all types of media \\u2013 can and do set aside concerns regarding professional objectivity in order to report on an issue or cause from an activist rather than a journalistic perspective. However, any media organization that does so will, in all likelihood, reach a point when it must decide that it cannot take up a cause. This is particularly problematic with regard to the ethics of reporting on natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, as media organizations may be forced to decide which lives are or are not worth campaigning to save.   39 5.2 Framing of Coverage  This section offers analysis on trends that emerged in the framing of stories appearing in the Vancouver Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail during the study period. 5.2.1 Political Stories   At various points during the three-month study period, each newspaper published stories that were critical of the Canadian government\\u2019s response to the tsunami. However, the target of the criticism, as well as the severity of the criticism, varied from newspaper to newspaper. Arguably, the National Post was the most critical of the three, pointing the finger of blame directly at Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin (Sokoloff and Curry A1). The Vancouver Sun, in contrast, published considerably fewer political stories and those that were published were less critical of the government than those printed in either of the national newspapers. Although it may seem to be the easiest answer, these differences cannot simply be attributed to the political bias of each newspaper. In the 2006 federal election, called less than one year after the tsunami struck, the National Post (\\u201cStephen Harper for Prime Minister\\u201d A20), the Globe and Mail (\\u201cThree reasons why it\\u2019s time for a change\\u201d A22), and the Vancouver Sun (\\u201cStephen Harper is our choice to clean up Ottawa\\u201d A14) all endorsed the Conservative party. Though the generally negative tone of the two national newspapers\\u2019 coverage of the Liberal government\\u2019s response to the tsunami may, in part, stem from some measure of political bias, the same cannot be said for the more positive tone of the Vancouver Sun\\u2019s coverage. At least at first glance, the differences in the tone of political tsunami-related stories do not seem to be attributable to mere ideological bias. A better explanation may be found in considering the mandates of each newspaper. While the National Post and the Globe and Mail both aim to serve a national audience, the Vancouver Sun aims to serve a local audience. Although Vancouver residents certainly have an interest in   40 knowing what their federal government is doing, there are numerous sources they can get this information from. Given the wealth of stories with strong Vancouver connections arising from the tsunami, the Vancouver Sun seems to have decided to devote the majority of its resources and column inches to telling those local stories, leaving it up to other news organizations to tell other types of tsunami-related stories. This would account not only for the smaller number of political stories published in the Vancouver Sun, but also for the less critical tone of those stories. While the Vancouver Sun\\u2019s stories were merely updates on the government\\u2019s actions, the two national newspapers, in fulfilling their mandates, were keeping a closer watch on the government and providing more in-depth coverage of its response to the disaster. Ultimately, in trying to serve a local audience, the Vancouver Sun devoted a great deal of coverage to a story unfolding half a world away while only peripherally covering the story unfolding in the nation\\u2019s capital. The two national newspapers, however, struck a more equitable balance between covering both the domestic and the international aspects of the tsunami story. This raises questions about how newspapers make decisions about what stories are relevant and newsworthy in light of their mandates and target audiences. 5.2.2 Recovery Stories  At first glance, it may seem as though all three newspapers published shockingly few stories about recovery after the tsunami. However, a careful reading of stories that were published in the three months immediately after the tsunami reveals that, in fact, all three newspapers generally framed recovery stories around the aid that funded recovery and reconstruction projects. Stories related to recovery tended to focus more on the amount of aid money being spent and where that money had come from, rather than on how the money was being spent or how a specific project fit into the broader recovery effort. As a result, these stories were classified as aid stories rather than recovery stories in this analysis.   41  For example, on January 26th, the National Post published a story in which NGO workers discussed how aid donations made in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami would be used to fund long-term reconstruction and recovery projects. However, because the story focused on the international outpouring of aid in the wake of the tsunami and what that would mean in terms of fully funding recovery efforts in the long term, rather than focusing on the actual recovery efforts, the story was classified as an aid story rather than a recovery story (Wattie A4). Likewise, on February 1st, the Globe and Mail reported that former American President Bill Clinton had been selected by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to head the organization\\u2019s tsunami relief efforts in Southeast Asia. The story also reiterated an earlier announcement that Clinton was aiming to raise $45 million to support clean water projects in the region, emphasizing the fundraising effort rather than the long-term nature of the projects and how they would support recovery after aid donations dried up (\\u201cClinton to head tsunami relief\\u201d A12). These are just two examples of recovery stories that were ultimately re-framed as aid stories. This framing raises questions about why recovery stories were re-framed as aid stories, and about framing more broadly. One possibility is that the outpouring of aid donations from individuals and governments alike in the wake of the disaster became a key narrative in coverage of the tsunami. Given the sheer number of stories about aid that were published after the disaster, what Vasterman refers to as a \\u201cpositive feedback loop\\u201d may have developed, whereby a theme emerges in news coverage and, over time, the threshold of newsworthiness is lowered for stories that can be tied to that theme (515). Perhaps, then, as discussed earlier, the tsunami developed as a broad theme in the news media and, within that theme, aid emerged as a sub-theme in its own right. It may have been easier for journalists to pitch recovery stories as aid stories, in fitting with this narrative theme and the lowered threshold of newsworthiness that was then applied to aid stories relative to recovery stories.   42 Alternatively, recovery stories may have been re-framed as aid stories in order to enable journalists to more directly relate these stories to their audiences. In a recovery story, tsunami victims were engaged in rebuilding efforts, but in an aid story, it was the donors \\u2013 a term which, due to the aid package the federal government offered up for tsunami relief, encompassed every Canadian taxpayer \\u2013 who were making recovery efforts possible. This re-framing may explain, at least in part, the duration of tsunami coverage evident in the three Canadian newspapers being studied: much of the coverage was actually about Canadians and only indirectly about tsunami victims. 5.2.3 Human Stories  For the first few weeks after the tsunami, all three newspapers printed story after story about the harrowing ordeals survivors overcame. But, as noted in the previous chapter, by the end of January, all three newspapers had shifted the focus of their human stories to the health threats facing survivors and government decisions relating to tsunami victims. Given the scope of the disaster, there was no shortage of survival stories to report on, so one might wonder why survival stories virtually disappeared before the one-month anniversary of the tsunami. It may be that in the days immediately after the tsunami, when dramatic tales of survival and suffering were abundant, the threshold for how much drama a human tsunami story had to contain in order to be reported was set quite high. Newspapers dutifully covered these stories but as time wore on, they exhausted the most dramatic stories. Though there was no shortage of stories to be told, readers had come to expect a certain level of drama in their coverage, which became increasingly difficult to find. In effect, in the days immediately following the tsunami, as the scope of the disaster became apparent, simple survival stories were crowded out by accounts of particularly harrowing ordeals. After reading the Vancouver Sun\\u2019s piece about Australian vacationer Jillian Searle, who was washed out to sea, let go of her 5-year old in order to keep   43 herself and her 2-year-old afloat, and later found her eldest child alive (Shadbolt A3), a reader could hardly be faulted for finding the newspaper\\u2019s earlier eyewitness account from a vacationing Vancouver radio reporter rather less gripping (\\u201cLocal man flees tsunamis while on vacation\\u201d A1).  It is also worth considering what other stories were making headlines at the time. Internationally, in the lead up to American President George W. Bush\\u2019s second inauguration (on January 20th), newspapers were publishing pieces speculating on his plans and priorities for his second term in office and reporting on preparations for the inauguration ceremony in Washington (Alberts A13). Later that month (on January 30th) Iraq was scheduled to hold its first legislative elections since the 2003 American-led invasion, which prompted many journalists to reflect on the country\\u2019s past and contemplate its future (Fisher A8). Nationally, Canada\\u2019s relationship with China (Fife A13) and the debate about same-sex marriage (Laghi A1) were taking up ink and column inches, slowly squeezing tsunami coverage out of the country\\u2019s newspapers. 5.2.4 Aid Stories  The narrative of Western generosity that emerged across aid stories published in all three newspapers may have driven Canadians to further charitable giving. As discussed in Brown and Minty\\u2019s study of American media coverage and charitable giving, a combination of the \\u201cbuy-in\\u201d and \\u201ccommitment\\u201d models can actually cause media coverage of giving to encourage further giving (6). The buy-in model posits that, after reading about the generosity of their fellow Canadians day after day in a newspaper, readers would feel compelled to help tsunami victims (Brown and Minty 6). The commitment model suggests that Canadians would feel compelled to help because their family, friends and colleagues had already donated (Brown and Minty 6). By repeatedly reporting on Canadians\\u2019 outpouring of charitable donations, the newspapers may, in   44 fact, have been informally fundraising for charitable organizations. This is incredibly problematic for all three newspapers\\u2019 claims of reporting on events accurately and fairly, given how that reporting may have, in fact, shaped the story.  However, there was a newsworthy story in Canadians\\u2019 unprecedented generosity. The challenge then is how to report on this type of story without falling into a cycle where donations continue to rise dramatically simply because newspapers (or, indeed, any news medium) are reporting stories about donations that essentially serve as unofficial fundraising campaigns for charitable groups. As the content analysis in the previous chapter indicated, stories critical of aid offered by governments and private citizens did emerge in all three newspapers, however, these types of stories generally did not appear until after the newspapers had ceased daily publication of dramatic and wrenching human stories. The combination of dramatic human stories and extremely positive stories about charitable giving evident in the Globe and Mail, the National Post and the Vancouver Sun raises additional questions about each of the newspapers\\u2019 impartiality in covering the tsunami. Given the timing of the disappearance of daily human stories and the appearance of stories critical of aid, it might appear that the newspapers were assisting charitable organizations in their fundraising efforts by disseminating heart wrenching stories while delaying publication of pieces that might make Canadians think twice about donating to relief efforts. When it comes to a newspaper\\u2019s credibility and reputation, whether this was actually the case matters far less than whether this is perceived to be the case. Despite the ethical issues around reporting on charitable giving after a major disaster, the fact remains that the outpouring of aid for tsunami victims was unprecedented, and therefore newsworthy. The issue is not whether the newspapers should have reported on it, but rather how they should have reported on it.   45 5.2.5 Terrorism Stories  Several stories classified as \\u201ccrime\\u201d stories in the content analysis, as well as a number of the political stories were related to concerns about the presence of terrorist groups in areas affected by the tsunami. More specifically, each of the three newspapers published stories about the likelihood of charitable donations being funneled to groups in Sri Lanka and Indonesia that would use the funds to support terrorism. The introduction of terrorism into the tsunami narrative raises several interesting issues and will be considered briefly. Raising the specter or terrorism also raised the amount of political capital Western politicians stood to gain from the disaster. Those who advocated providing aid to areas and groups where terrorism concerns existed were essentially staking their political careers on confidence in the systems their states and the international community alike had implemented in order to prevent money laundering in support of terrorism. This entailed big risks for politicians planning to run in future elections however, for some, like Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, there were big electoral gains to be made by pushing for aid to be distributed to these areas. Martin refused to join some of Canada\\u2019s allies, as well as international organizations like the UN, in adding the Tamil Tigers to the federal government\\u2019s list of terrorist organizations and insisted that the country should send aid to areas of Sri Lanka controlled by the Tamil Tigers (Wong and Clark A1). Although Martin drew criticism for his decision, particularly from members of the Conservative party, he also increased the Liberal party\\u2019s popularity among Tamils across Canada (Wark A19). With more than 300,000 Tamils, Canada is home to the largest Tamil diaspora population in the world, and, since most Tamils in Canada have concentrated in and around Toronto, they represent a significant proportion of eligible voters in a handful of federal ridings (Eaves A5). For Martin, the risk of being credited with enabling Canadians to fund terrorism appears to have been worth the potential reward of swaying a few   46 hundred thousand Canadians to vote for the Liberal party in key constituencies in the next federal election. Evidently, the opportunity to increase his political capital was one Martin could not allow to pass. Politics aside, the terrorism-related issues raised by all three newspapers in the course of providing tsunami coverage are significant. The focus on terrorism after the disaster suggests that although the tsunami emerged as a theme in Canadian print media for a time, some aspects of the disaster itself fit within the broader, more established theme of terrorism that has become a staple of media coverage since the September 11th attacks. This may explain why the tsunami remained a major focus of media attention for so long after the waves receded. 5.3 Summary   This study found that although there are some notable differences between the Globe and Mail, the National Post and the Vancouver Sun, simply catering to the same type of audience (i.e. national) is no guarantee that an analysis of coverage from two different newspapers will produce similar results. Although both cater to national audiences, there were many differences between the National Post and the Globe and Mail in terms of the amount of coverage afforded to the tsunami, the timing of peak coverage and where tsunami-related stories were published.  The Globe and Mail published a greater number of stories and photographs on its peak coverage days than the National Post did (31 stories vs. 24 stories, and 28 photographs vs. 22 photographs, respectively). The Globe and Mail was also later in dropping tsunami coverage from its front page than the National Post (January 15th edition vs. January 5th edition).  Perhaps not surprisingly, given the newspaper\\u2019s more local focus, the Vancouver Sun, offered the least tsunami coverage of the three newspapers, publishing 18 stories and 17 photos on its days of peak story and photographic coverage. The Vancouver Sun was also the first to   47 drop tsunami coverage from its front page, publishing its January 1st edition with all of its tsunami coverage inside the paper. Despite these differences, however, four trends related to story framing and the narrative arc of the disaster did appear to hold true across all three newspapers. First, pieces that are framed as political stories and critical of the government are not necessarily fuelled by inherent political bias, at least with regard to a foreign natural disaster. Also, it appears that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, the abundance of dramatic stories that can be told raise the bar in terms of the level of drama a disaster story must have in order to be reported. As time progresses, coverage of these stories may drop off altogether simply because the most dramatic stories have already been told and others, though still quite dramatic, do not meet the new standard. Next, it seems that recovery stories are often re-framed as aid stories, thereby more directly relating the story to the audience. The story becomes about what they, as donors, have made possible, rather than what people in a far off place are doing following a disaster. Finally, there does not seem to be any pattern to when a disaster disappears from a newspaper\\u2019s front page. Even an anniversary commemorating a major disaster is no assurance of front page coverage. 5.4 Implications 5.4.1 Implications for Foreign News  The saturation coverage the three newspapers considered in this study devoted to the tsunami \\u2013 and the lively debate some of that coverage sparked on those newspapers\\u2019 letter to the editor pages \\u2013 demonstrates that Canadians are interested in events happening around the world, and journalists know it. Despite the newsroom restructurings that have seen many news organizations scale back or even drop their foreign bureaus altogether, Canadians are still hungry for foreign news beyond so-called \\u201ccalendar reporting,\\u201d that is, covering foreign elections and   48 international meetings that are scheduled in advance, rather than covering unpredictable, breaking news. The challenge then, is to feed this appetite for foreign news on little or no foreign news budget. But this challenge can be overcome. As some did after the tsunami, newspapers can publish foreign news pieces written by journalists working in other mediums who are already in place when stories break. For example, the National Post published Global News at Noon anchor Anne-Marie Mediwake\\u2019s travel journal about how the tsunami impacted her native Sri Lanka, documenting recovery efforts one month after the disaster (Mediwake A2). The Vancouver Sun did something similar, although in that instance local radio reporter Michael McLaughlin was vacationing, not working, on the Malaysian island of Penang when the tsunami struck (\\u201cLocal man flees tsunamis while on vacation\\u201d A1). In addition to tapping into the pool of journalists already present, traditional media organizations can turn to citizen journalists to report on breaking foreign news \\u2013 a practice that has become increasingly popular since 2004. The implications this may have for citizen journalism are considered later in this thesis. 5.4.2 Implications for Disaster Reporting  As illustrated by the National Post\\u2019s coverage of the tsunami on February 12th, when the newspaper\\u2019s coverage was disproportionate to the amount of new information coming out of Southeast Asia, under the right circumstances, a media organization may decide to set aside professional considerations \\u2013 such as impartiality \\u2013 in order to take up an issue or a cause. Arguably, all three newspapers analyzed in this study took up the cause of tsunami victims to some extent, publishing a multitude of stories about aid and even turning Canadians\\u2019 outpouring of charitable giving to tsunami relief and recovery into a narrative theme in their disaster reporting. Beyond the obvious issues surrounding impartiality, this is problematic in that it inevitably forces journalists to take on the work of international organizations and charities,   49 choosing which causes to fundraise for, and, particularly after natural or humanitarian disasters, which lives are worth campaigning to save. There are ways, however, for journalists working inside disaster zones to maintain a measure of objectivity without turning a blind eye to the suffering around them. For example, they can share stories with their personal networks and encourage those people to donate to a cause, or, they can donate to a cause themselves once they have finished reporting. Professionally, journalists would do better to tell compelling stories in the immediate aftermath of a disaster and, in the long run, after media attention has drifted elsewhere, periodically report on stories that remind the audience that human suffering did not end when the last of the foreign journalists left. Although this might be difficult to pitch outside the window for anniversary stories commemorating a disaster, journalists who are persistent in seeking poignant tales from former disaster zones are likely to find them, as is evident from the quantity of coverage included in the National Post\\u2019s February 12th edition. 5.4.3 Implications for Citizen Journalism   Citizen journalism and technological change have enabled citizens to begin reporting for media organizations before journalists arrive on the scene. Thanks to technological advancements, anyone with a cell phone can break stories for print, radio, television and online mediums by capturing audio, video and still images, or posting text online.  In the wake of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami, the newspapers considered in this study did not, for the most part, draw on material from the public. In part, this may reflect the nascent nature of citizen journalism at the time of the tsunami. Although blogs were popular by late 2004, the photo-sharing website Flickr was still relatively new and growing slowly. Moreover, websites like YouTube and Twitter had not been developed yet (the former was created in 2005 and the latter was not created until 2006). The absence of citizen journalism from most of the   50 tsunami coverage analyzed in this study may also be explained by the medium being analyzed. Since this analysis considered the print editions of all three newspapers and did not look at web content, there were limited opportunities for the inclusion of citizen journalism. In a print edition of a newspaper, text and a limited number of photos can be re-published \\u2013 and, in all three newspapers considered in this study, they were \\u2013 however there is no opportunity to share audio or video submitted by users. An analysis of traditional news organizations\\u2019 online tsunami coverage may very well demonstrate a much greater use of citizen journalism.  However, there are ethical considerations around citizen journalism that must be taken into account. Just because citizen journalists can post content online instantaneously does not mean they should, nor does it mean that traditional media organizations should disseminate works of citizen journalism indiscriminately. In their reporting on the tsunami, the three newspapers analyzed in this study demonstrated caution when re-producing works of citizen journalism, doing so sparingly and tastefully. However, as citizen journalism evolves and technology continues to advance, traditional news organizations will likely have more and more citizen-generated content available to incorporate into their own reporting. Traditional media organizations must continue to exercise careful judgment in terms of what works of citizen journalism they re-publish if they are to protect their reputations. Likewise, citizen journalists should consider issues of taste and decency when publishing breaking news online, lest citizen journalism become little more than tabloid-esque shock journalism.  Citizen journalism has proven to be particularly useful in providing coverage of major natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina and the January earthquake in Haiti, since a disaster can happen quickly and leave many hard hit areas inaccessible. When covering these types of stories, ethical considerations become even more important, as citizen journalists may find themselves surrounded by the sights and sound bytes of suffering and death. Just as traditional media organizations play a gatekeeper role, making decisions about what they should   51 disseminate, citizen journalists must exercise judgment in deciding what to publish. Like traditional news organizations, citizen journalists\\u2019 reporting can have consequences (i.e. emotional consequences for disaster victims and their families). However, unlike many traditional news organizations, most citizen journalists are not guided by proactive policies regarding standards of taste and decency. Instead, citizen journalists tend to take a reactive approach, commenting and debating when they feel one of their number has crossed a line in their reporting. Citizen journalists must continue to exercise judgment in their reporting and continue to band together, enforcing standards of taste and decency upon one another, particularly when engaging in disaster reporting. 5.5 Conclusion   This descriptive research project discovered four trends in disaster reporting that appear to hold true across all three newspapers, regardless of whether they cater to a local or national audience. Firstly, as CARMA notes, political capital is tied to the amount of coverage a disaster gets, although findings from this study suggest that coverage isn\\u2019t necessarily inherently political (9). Secondly, Vasterman\\u2019s positive feedback loops \\u2013 instances where a theme develops and, over time, stories that fit within that theme are held to a lower standard of newsworthiness \\u2013 do seem to exist (515). However, a second loop also appears to exist in which the most dramatic stories are disseminated after a disaster, establishing a high threshold for the amount of drama a story must contain in order to be reported. Over time, fewer stories meet the new standard and eventually these types of stories disappear altogether. Thirdly, all three newspapers tended to re- frame recovery stories as aid stories. This may have been done to more directly relate the story to a Canadian audience, suggesting that Galtung and Ruge\\u2019s hypothesis still holds true: news from culturally distant or low-rank countries must allow an audience to identify with a story in order for that story to be reported (68). Finally, there does not appear to be any pattern to when a   52 disaster disappears from the front page, or what is required to get it back there after it has been bumped. Ultimately, this study found that although narrative arcs in disaster reporting follow similar patterns across newspapers, other aspects of disaster coverage \\u2013 such as in the quantity or location of coverage \\u2013 vary from newspaper to newspaper. 5.6 Limitations   Although this research produced some interesting results, limitations inherent in the methodology employed to collect the data must be taken into consideration. First and foremost, the results of the content analysis were not peer-reviewed for inter-coder reliability. If a peer- review were to be conducted, some of the coding in the content analysis might be expected to change. Although this would result in revisions to real numbers, it would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader trends noted in the study. The research is also limited in that it seeks to examine print media coverage available to residents of Vancouver but limits its scope of analysis to mainstream, English language newspapers available in the city. A study of the Vancouver\\u2019s ethnic newspapers, particularly those targeted at the city\\u2019s Asian communities, may produce vastly different results from this study.   53 6.0 Suggestions for Further Research After donations flooded organizations mobilizing relief and aid programs for victims of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami, researchers sought to understand the link between media coverage and charitable giving. An American study found that a 700-word story in a major daily newspaper raised charitable donations by an average of 18.2% (Brown and Minty 13). To date, no similar studies have been conducted to determine the impact of media coverage on charitable giving in Canada, or most other states. The American study also determined that encouraging the media to keep humanitarian crises in the news is in the best interest of charitable organizations, however, the needs of those charities \\u2013 particularly those that invest their limited resources in positioning themselves to provide post-disaster updates over the long run \\u2013 generally do not enter into the media\\u2019s decision-making (Brown and Minty 13). Ethical issues aside, these areas require further research because in order for the media to act in the public good, journalists must have a thorough understanding of the impact their work can have. Another area for further research involves examining what opportunities exist to reduce the number of foreign journalists accessing a disaster zone. Ill-prepared journalists can drive up the cost of living as they stockpile food, water and medical supplies for their own use (Downman 5). Additionally, if they are forced to turn to international organizations and NGOs for supplies, the presence of these journalists can put a strain on relief efforts (Downman 10). However, as some did after the tsunami, news organizations can limit the number of journalists dispatched to a disaster zone by turning to journalists capable of working across mediums for disaster coverage (i.e. turning to a television reporter for print coverage). Citizen journalists in the area who are able to work in multiple mediums may also be well positioned to provide coverage, further reducing news organizations\\u2019 need to dispatch foreign journalists to a disaster zone. Future research should consider how to balance the need for journalists to access a disaster area in order   54 to report on it against the need for minimizing access to a disaster zone in order to best serve victims. Another area for further research is that of the narrative themes that typically emerge during disaster reporting. As Penelope Ploughman noted in a 1997 study of seven disasters \\u2013 both natural and man-made \\u2013 disaster reporting typically focuses on community breakdown, characterized by people panicking, fleeing the affected area and looting. However, Ploughman found that in reality, the majority of people react rationally to disasters in an effort to try and return to normality as quickly as possible (121). Though this community breakdown narrative did not emerge in the media\\u2019s coverage of the Southeast Asian tsunami, it appeared in media coverage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Bevc 61) and has been a theme in coverage of the January earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti (\\u201cHaiti Earthquake: Is the term \\u2018looting\\u2019 racist? Past Kanye West comments fuel debate\\u201d). Additional research in this area would serve two purposes: furthering understanding of why certain narrative themes emerge in media coverage of some disasters but not others, and exploring ways to reorient media coverage to better reflect a post-disaster situation, rather than lapsing into the familiar narratives that journalists seem to rely on. This leads into another area for further research: the ethics of disaster reporting. The sheer quantity of coverage that saturates the media after a natural disaster indicates that disaster reporting is not \\u201cbusiness as usual\\u201d in terms of journalistic practices, but it is less clear whether the usual ethical considerations apply. This study\\u2019s findings suggest that under the right circumstances, newspapers can and do set aside concerns regarding professional impartiality in order to report on an issue from an activist rather than a journalistic perspective. More research is needed to explore if this is the case for all news mediums and, if so, why. If this does, in fact, prove to be a trend, the long-term implications of this practice for media credibility should also be studied.   55 Finally, the question of where citizen journalism fits into Ploughman\\u2019s post-disaster credibility hierarchy requires further research. Ploughman\\u2019s research has established that in disaster reporting, the media relies upon the established credibility hierarchy \\u2013 usually governments \\u2013 to determine the salience of issues and set agendas for discourse on those issues (119). However, with the advent of citizen journalism \\u2013 be it blog entries or uploading user- generated content to a traditional media organization\\u2019s website \\u2013 advances in technology that have equipped millions of cell phone users with camera phones, and websites like Twitter and YouTube that allow users to spread news faster than journalistic principles of verification allow, the established credibility hierarchy no longer accurately reflects the environment most journalists involved in disaster reporting must operate in. Due to the nature of the medium analyzed here and the time period considered, these changes were not major factors in this study. However, all these changes have empowered citizen journalists, giving them a voice in post- disaster agenda setting and challenging the government\\u2019s position at the top of the credibility hierarchy. As citizen journalism continues to evolve, the need for research into how this type of journalism fits into broader disaster reporting grows.   56 References Abd-El-Aziz, Alaa.

As a prominent issue of public discourse, climate change has developed its own specific lexicon of cultural signifiers and visual idioms, including images of melting glaciers, polar animals, and a \\u201cburning\\u201d planet Earth.  This project examines visual images associated with climate change coverage from several online (website) sources, including two Google image searches, three media outlet sites, and four non-governmental organization websites that generate literature or information about climate change for an international audience.  By analyzing content, thematic elements, and rhetorical issues relating to the displayed images, this project attempts to develop a discussion of the significance of images used by online sources featuring climate change content. Images featuring \\u201cice\\u201d and \\u201cfire\\u201d motifs are still popular, although other generalized, iconic imagery was also evident, depicting smokestacks, alternative energy projects, and extreme weather scenarios. In general, media outlets tended to feature more specific photographic content, while other organizations used more generalized content, often featuring images of de-populated \\u201cwild\\u201d landscapes that conform to Western cultural rhetoric associated with the natural world.   iii Preface  This project was approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board

students at the UBC Department of Journalism, including Dr. Mary Lynn Young, Alfred Hermida, Joe Cutbirth, Kathryn Gretsinger, Nicola Jones, Dan Burnett, David Beers, Barry Warne, Barbara Wallin.  In particular, my work benefitted from the school\\u2019s dedication to discussing rapidly changing media models and the role of online journalism.  I owe special thanks to Dr. Mary Lynn Young, who supported my choice of an unusual area of scholarship, and Dr. Candis Callison, who offered her own expertise in climate change research and journalism studies.  I am also grateful for the guidance of Dr. Ron Burnett, President of Emily Carr University of Art and Design. Dr. Burnett\\u2019s writings and personal assistance were very helpful throughout this process.  During my masters\\u2019 studies, I was grateful to receive support from a SSHRC (Joseph- Armand Bombardier) Canada Graduate Scholarship, a CTV Globemedia Fellowship, and a Gwyn and Aileen Gunn Bursary in Journalism.  I owe special thanks to my family and friends, who were tirelessly encouraging, and often cooked me dinner.    viii Dedication  To my father, Richard Greyson, whose love of science and the natural world has been a lifelong inspiration. After sending me articles and books about climate change for almost a decade, my father\\u2019s concern about this issue became my concern, and I\\u2019m grateful for his interest and enthusiasm.  In memory of my mother, Dorothy, who showed me a Lawren Harris painting of a snow- capped mountain long before I entered kindergarten. Her deep love of literature and painting remains a strong current in my life, and I hope she would have enjoyed the cross-disciplinary scholarship of this thesis.   1 1    Chapter: INTRODUCTION        This idea for this project began, appropriately enough, with an image. The image in question is a printed copy of a photograph, taken over a decade ago and now glued into a battered blue scrapbook. Snapped by a friend on a cardboard disposable camera, the photograph shows me sitting on the side of a snow face, anchored with ropes, harness, and ice axe. Participating in a week-long mountaineering course near Whistler, B.C., my memories now recall the hot August sun beating down on Blackcomb Glacier, and streams of clear glacial melt-water trickling along the edges of granite boulders.      This photograph recalls a personal excursion, but it also symbolizes the genesis of awareness. In the late 1990\\u2019s, I was more aware of logging in west coast forests than of global warming. I recall learning about melting glaciers and climate change in later years, and my concern was forever linked to the vivid memories I carried after my first (and only) traverse of a glacier.      Over ten years later, my understanding of climate change has altered. Now, the issue is shaped not only by my personal experience, but also by the particular types of public discourse that the issue has engendered. In the last fifteen years, the widespread dissemination of scientific reports, scholarly analysis, and mass media stories have covered the issue extensively, discussing the state of this environmental crisis and its implications for local and international stability.       While the focus of this coverage has varied depending upon content and context, news stories about climate change have discussed scientific research findings, ecological impacts, and government policy regarding greenhouse gas emissions in detail (Adam 2007, Kleiner 2009, Bhanoo 2010, Revkin 2009, Revkin and Kanter 2009, Chang 2009, Pope 2010, McKie  2 2010, Brown 2010, Ward 2010b). Public concern over climate change has even permeated popular culture (Maslin 2009).      With every article and broadcast, various visual images have been employed by media producers in an attempt to illustrate climate change for readers or viewers. In addition to graphs and charts used to show global warming trends, various types of photographic images are utilized repeatedly. In particular, two types of thematic choices predominate, and can be classified as either \\u201cfire\\u201d or \\u201cice\\u201d images. In many of these images, visual motifs of heat or fire is repeatedly used, particularly in multi-layered illustrations of flames superimposed on an image of Planet Earth. Images of ice, ranging from melting blue icebergs to cracking ice sheets, are also used repeatedly in broadcast, print, and online sources.       While a number of scholars have examined mass media coverage of climate change from a variety of perspectives, few studies have specifically examined the visual images associated with climate change coverage. For my master\\u2019s thesis for the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of British Columbia, I will develop an analysis of images of climate change, sourced from mass media and non-governmental organizations\\u2019 websites. By discussing these images within a cultural and historical context, I hope to present an analysis that is cross-disciplinary in approach, thereby adding to current communications scholarship on this issue.  1.1 Methodology       For this project, the sources for these images will consist of several online web pages focusing on climate change. These web pages can be classified according to three categories. The first set of web pages will be generated by a Google image search using \\u201cclimate  3 change\\u201d and \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d search terms. The second set of web pages will consist of online feature articles and climate change information pages produced by three national newspapers from three countries: The Globe and Mail (Canada), The New York Times (U.S.), and the Guardian (U.K.). The third group of online pages to be examined will be from the websites of four organizations who are leading producers of information and visual images related to climate change: the David Suzuki Foundation, Greenpeace International, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Geographic Society.      By examining the images available on these web pages, I hope to develop a specific discussion regarding the use, prevalence, and context of images related to climate change. By developing my own adaptation of the critical discourse analysis method utilized by Carvahlo and Burgess (2005), I will examine these images as \\u201ctexts\\u201d, identifying general \\u201cmorphological\\u201d characteristics, thematic elements, and rhetorical issues relating to the images. Twenty-two categories of specific thematic content and image type will govern the classification of each image, and these classifications will be compared to determine the dominant motifs that are presented on the web pages.       As well as identifying content and type of image, other visual and design considerations will be noted, including the relative size of images, the number of icons or images per page, and the placement of images related to text content. The structural \\u201carchitecture\\u201d of these websites will also be considered, in order to ascertain how easily users can navigate the site and how prominently the relevant information is displayed. These components will not only be commented on individually, but comparisons will also be drawn between the groups of websites examined.    4 1.2 Climate change and the Media  1.2.1 Climate change background       Climate change, as presented as part of public discourse, is primarily understood as a geo- physical phenomenon associated with rising global temperatures. Caused primarily by greenhouse gas emissions associated with human activities since the industrial revolution, climate change has been called the \\u201cstory of the century\\u201d by media analysts, citing scientific predictions that climate change will undoubtedly produce widespread ecological impacts, affecting communities and biological organisms around the globe (Ward 2007, Ward 2008).      Climate change, however, does not exist merely in graphs, charts, and reports produced by scientists and researchers. Over forty years of discussion and debate have re-shaped climate change as a contemporary cultural construct, acting like a \\u201cmutating hybrid entity\\u201d that blurs the boundaries between the natural and cultural spheres (Hulme 2008, 5). Without a sophisticated comprehension of how our cultural understanding of climate change operates within public discourse, we have little hope of developing effective strategies to combat the problem.      But before diving into these complex cultural issues, it is important to re-examine the historical context of climate change research. While public consciousness of this issue has slowly developed within the last few decades, scientists and researchers have been examining changing climate models for many years.  As far back as the 18th century, explorers noted extensive deforestation and a resulting impact on the climate of Mauritius (Grove 1995, 91). In 1824, French physicist Joseph Fourier developed a theoretical description of what is now known as the \\u201cgreenhouse effect\\u201d, or the warming of the earth from solar energy trapped by  5 the atmosphere (Flannery 2005, 38-9).  And Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius expanded this work at the end of the 19th century, identifying the burning of fossil fuels as a cause of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which he posited would result in the warming of the Earth\\u2019s temperature (Flannery 2005, 40, Hoggan 2009, 17, Weart 2004).      In the modern era, discussions of climate change began to surface in the political realm in the 1960s, with President Lyndon Johnson addressing the issue in a message to Congress, and subsequent American politicians citing their concern with research presented by prominent scientists (Hoggan 2010, 16-20). In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), considered one of the preeminent international consortiums of scientific knowledge on the subject.  Four reports have been generated by the IPCC and circulated internationally, the latest being the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report. While earlier reports were less conclusive, the 2007 report stated that global climate change was \\u201cunequivocal\\u201d, and that much of the current increases in globally averaged temperatures was occurring as a direct result of anthropogenic (human) activities (IPCC 2007).      This wasn\\u2019t the first strong statement on climate change from scientists. In 1988, this link between anthropogenic activity and global warming was acknowledged publicly in a widely reported testimony given before the U.S. Senate. James Hansen, the head of NASA\\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, testified before the U.S. Energy and Natural Resources Committee that record high temperatures were the direct result of anthropogenic activity (Maslin 2009 28). This testimony became headline news in the American media, and is now  6 regarded as a pivotal moment in the development of climate change as an issue of public concern (Sheppard 2008).      In addition to the IPCC reports, national and international science academies and organizations have agreed with or endorsed the findings of the IPCC.  In 2004, the intergovernmental Arctic Council and the non-governmental International Arctic Science Committee produced a synthesis report, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, which stated that the polar regions were experiencing rapid environmental changes due to rising temperatures.  According to the report, climate change impacts would be likely be more severe in the Arctic and Antarctic than in other regions, and that \\u201cthere is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities\\u201d (UNEP/GRID Arendal 2004).      Since 2001, 32 national science academies have issued joint declarations confirming anthropogenic global warming, including the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and the Royal Society of Canada. In 2001, following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled \\u201cThe Science of Climate Change\\u201d, endorsing scientific consensus on the issue. This statement was published as an editorial in Science on May 18, 2001 (Royal Society et al. 2001).      In an attempt to bridge the divide between scientific research and the general public, a number of authors have written popular books describing the issue of climate change. The first of these works, written by New York Times reporter Andrew Revkin in 1992, followed the Hansen testimony to the U.S. Senate. The majority of well-known works, however, were published in the last decade (see Wohlforth 2004, Flannery 2005, and Kolbert 2006, for example). This sudden rise in public attention in recent years may be partially attributed to  7 the success of Al Gore\\u2019s 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, which won international accolades, and was credited with raising the public profile of the issue significantly (Maslin 2009 37).      But despite the popularity of many of these works, some activists and researchers are concerned that public opinion has not kept pace with the seriousness of the threat of climate change. Mass media coverage has been critiqued by scholars as being rife with bias, riddled with policy concerns, and subject to confusing, misleading debates (Gelbspan 1998, Monbiot 2006, Maslin 2009, Hoggan 2010, Oreskes and Conway 2010). According to some, the mass media has \\u201cfailed to inform their readers and listeners about what is surely the most important and dangerous environmental issue in the history of humankind\\u201d (Hoggan and Littlemore 2010, 153).       Recent research suggests that this concern is warranted, as a 2009 poll from the Pew Research Centre indicated that only 35% of Americans see climate change as a serious problem, a decline of 9% from the previous year (Pew Research Centre 2009). Some have blamed the so-called \\u201cclimate gate\\u201d scandal of 2009 as the cause of this decline. Hacked emails from the University of East Anglia\\u2019s Climatic Research Unit were published, leading to charges that climate scientists had manipulated data or attempted to silence critics. Despite several independent investigations indicating no evidence of unethical practice, concern remains that this issue eroded public confidence in climate research (Tollefson 2010).  1.2.2 Media issues and climate change       Despite widespread scientific acknowledgement and political confirmation of the importance of climate change as an issue of concern, Western mass media has not necessarily  8 responded with coverage reflecting this perspective. Scholars acknowledge that mass media has a great influence on the public\\u2019s perception of the issue of climate change (Trumbo and Shanahan 2000, Carvahlo and Burgess 2005, Hansen 2010). Part of the challenge of presenting accurate information about climate change for the general public lies in the divide between the practice of science and the practice of journalism (Dean 2009, Callison 2010).       In particular, there have been widespread critiques of the mass media coverage of so- called \\u201cdebates\\u201d within the scientific community regarding climate change. In an attempt to shed light on this issue, science historian Naomi Oreskes published a widely cited report in 2004, asserting that no such debate was a factor within the scientific community. Oreskes\\u2019 study, titled \\u201cBeyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change\\u201d, analyzed 928 scientific abstracts published between 1993 and 2003. Her report noted that 75 per cent of the examined abstracts either explicitly or implicitly backed the consensus view of climate change supported by the IPCC and other organizations, with the remaining 25 per cent detailing methodology or other issues and taking no position on the issue. Oreskes noted that out of the 928 published reports, none dissented from this perspective (Oreskes 2004).       George Monbiot, a syndicated columnist with the Guardian newspaper, has also written extensively about media coverage of climate change. In Monbiot\\u2019s 2006 book, Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning, he critiqued industry-funded opinion groups and individuals campaigning to discredit climate change science who were given credence by journalists as \\u201cexperts\\u201d.  In a syndicated column article titled \\u201cThe Fossil Fools\\u201d, Monbiot argued that more often than not, media outlets were acting like the \\u201cpublic relations arms of fossil fuel companies\\u201d (Monbiot 2004).  9      Max Boykoff, currently working at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado, has written a number of academic articles examining the coverage of climate change by U.S. and U.K. media outlets. His 2005 article, \\u201cThe Disconnect of News Reporting from Scientific Evidence\\u201d, argued that \\u201cbalanced\\u201d coverage of climate change had generated a misleading public perception that there is not consensus in the scientific community regarding climate change (Boykoff 2005).      Boykoff has also examined print and television broadcast coverage of climate change in the U.S. and the U.K. His 2007 article, titled \\u201cFlogging a dead norm?\\u201d, noted specific differences between newspaper coverage of climate change in the U.S. and U.K. between 2003 and 2006. The American newspapers Boykoff examined tended to downplay or ignore scientific consensus regarding climate change during this time period, while the U.K. newspapers he examined did not, indicating that regional concerns and policy complicated media coverage (Boykoff 2007). Other articles by Boykoff show that television coverage in the U.S. has also been subject to the same biased climate change coverage evident in print journalism, and that traditional journalistic practices plays an important role in climate change coverage (Boykoff 2005, Boykoff and Rajan 2007, Boykoff M. and J., 2007).      Other scholars have shown that media outlets have presented climate change with varying levels of coverage. Two studies examining national U.S. newspapers identified specific \\u201cissue attention cycles\\u201d evident in press coverage of climate change. In a ten year study of five national U.S. papers between 1985 \\u2013 1995, Craig Trumbo identified that media coverage of the issue was almost non-existent before 1988, but that media coverage rose between 1989 and 1992, peaking with the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. After 1992, media interest waned once more (Trumbo 1996, McComas and Shanahan 1999).  10      In a 2005 article, Anabela Carvahlo and Jacquelin Burgess presented a similar study, this time examining examined climate change coverage in U.K. newspapers between 1985 and 2003. Their research identified three distinct time periods associated with British newspaper coverage of climate change, with coverage rising dramatically between 1997 to 2003, as extreme weather events \\u201cprovided news organizations with concrete evidence strengthening the argument\\u201d that climate change was occurring. (Carvahlo and Burgess 2005, 1466). Carvahlo and Burgess\\u2019 study also noted that the dominant ideological standpoints of the examined newspapers played a role in the type of coverage offered.      While British and American media coverage of climate change has been examined fairly extensively, fewer scholars have done the same type of analysis for Canadian media coverage. In a 2008 article published in the Canadian Journal of Communication, Jennifer Good compared climate change coverage \\u201cframing\\u201d in Canadian, American and international newspapers from January \\u2013 December, 2007. Using Noam Chomsky\\u2019s media propaganda model (Chomsky 1999), Good noted that all three regions examined showed a hesitancy to frame climate change within the context of political policy recommendations, and that Canadian newspapers were more likely to talk about climate change and global warming than either the U.S. or international newspapers over the 2007 time period (Good 2008).       While the critiques of media coverage concerning climate change are warranted, it is also important to acknowledge the complexities involved for journalists and media outlets in producing news on scientific issues. Climate change is a particularly difficult issue to cover, partly due to the complexity of the research, which involves \\u201cabstract and probabilistic science, labyrinthine laws, grandstanding politicians, [and] speculative economics\\u201d (Wilson 2000, 206). Bridging the gap between scientists and the public is a problem, particularly in an  11 era of increasing research specialization on one hand, and widespread lack of basic \\u201cscience literacy\\u201d in the general public on the other (Blum 2006, Revkin 2006, Kennedy 2010, 5, Miller 2010, Mooney 2010).       At the same time, it is important to move beyond reductionist assumption about public understandings of scientific research. The transfer of scientific knowledge is not always enough to promote political change and citizen engagement (Wynne 1996, Lahsen 2005, Jasanoff 2005, Callison 2010). If public knowledge of science is trivialized, the potential for rational, informed responses from many sectors of society is ignored, \\u201creduc[ing] human cognition to a one-dimensional scale\\u201d (Jasanoff 2005, 270).      Offering in-depth coverage of scientific issues in the mass media is an important step, but this has been made more challenging in recent years.  The rapid shifts in the media industry have had a serious impact on science coverage, as fewer writers specializing in science are employed at media outlets, and science stories are often farmed out to journalists without a science background (Russell 2010). As well, media outlets with fewer resources are less able to cover science issues effectively, often eliminating science sections altogether. The rise of online publishing has also led to many \\u201cunreliable, inaccurate\\u201d websites, particularly fueling \\u201canti-science sentiment\\u201d and \\u201canti-climate science\\u201d (Russell 2010, 20-23).      Science historian Naomi Oreskes offers perspective on this issue, in her 2004 paper, \\u201cScience and public policy: What\\u2019s proof got to do with it?\\u201d, published in Environmental Science and Policy.  In this article, Oreskes critiques the general assumption that science must provide \\u201cproof\\u201d in order to claim validity for their research, and she argues that this type of response is misguided. Instead, Oreskes notes that science findings can provide informed opinions about possible outcomes and consequences of our actions and activities,  12 but should not be regarded as debatable according to the standards that many critics of climate change appear to demand (Oreskes 2004).      For journalists, these concerns all play a part in the challenge of providing critical, careful coverage of the climate change issue. Navigating research jargon while ignoring the temptation to highlight the \\u201cjuiciest\\u201d elements of a story is an essential part of careful climate change reporting (Revkin 2006, 225). And as one of the most politicized areas of science journalism, coverage of climate change requires not only careful research, but a \\u201cthick skin\\u201d in order to weather the criticisms of concerned stakeholders on different sides of the issue (McFarling 2006, 243).  1.2.3 Environmental issues in the media       Developing a clear understanding of the mass media\\u2019s role in developing public discussions about environmental issues continues to be an ongoing concern for journalists, scholars, and activists. Faced with the challenges of presenting complex stories to an ever- shrinking audience, journalists and media professionals are often unable to adequately research or report on important news items. As a result, coverage of environmental issues in the mass media has often suffered, with many stories either under-reported, or overly sensationalized (Cox 2006, 164, Revkin 2010, Ward 2010).      The shifting nature of the media news cycle also affects the coverage of environmental news items, including coverage of the climate change issue (Mazur and Lee 1993, Shabecoff 2000, McComas, Shanahan and Butler 2001). While some scholars have examined the strategies of environmental activists designed to generate media attention, few critics have examined the specific rhetorical construction of mass media coverage of environmental  13 issues, or how this shapes our cultural understanding of the natural world (Wilson 1990, Deluca 1999, Meister 2002, 2).       Various communications theorists have worked within the premise that the mass media have a significant role to play within the public arena, although the extent of this influence has been broadly debated (see, for example, Lippman 1922, Dewey 1927, Habermas 1962). Other scholars have acknowledged that the mass media has been subject to various societal, political and economic pressures that have impacted the development of journalistic production (Bourdieu 1998, Curran 2002).  The traditional reporting model emphasizing events-based news is not necessarily the best avenue to discuss the complexities of various environmental issues, particularly long-term and accumulative (non-visible) problems like climate change  (Hansen 1993, Allen et al. 2000).      Analysis of media coverage of climate change has generated discussion and research among scholars for approximately twenty years, with a specific focus located on media coverage in the United States and United Kingdom. Each of these studies, however, has predominantly been focused on the textual content of the media coverage, examining the types of coverage according to the issues raised, angle of article, type of analysis, and use of expert opinion. And few scholars have examined the presentation of images linked to this text or broadcast content.       The presentation of many environmental issues relies upon the use of effective, eye- catching visual images (Deluca 1999, Cox 2006). While there are certainly debates about the types of media strategies and images used to publicize environmental campaigns, years of discussion about issues like deforestation, air pollution, and loss of biodiversity has created a companion lexicon of imagery that are now largely understood by the general public. Images  14 of hillsides marred by clear-cuts logging and smog pouring from smokestacks are relatively easy to comprehend, and can be \\u201cread\\u201d as linking to specific discourse about an environmental issue.       In comparison, presenting the issue of climate change within a visual context is incredibly difficult. While critiqued as a misleading source of data, the \\u201cMann hockey stick\\u201d was one of the few charts, graphs, and diagrams published by climate scientists and researchers that was visually eye-catching enough to warrant public attention (National Academy of Sciences 2006). Even Al Gore\\u2019s use of a mechanical lift device to illustrate temperature elevations during his lectures, while engaging to watch, has not translated into imagery that has been widely reproduced or commented upon.      In contrast with other environmental issues, climate change is a phenomenon that is occurring on a broad scale, with many impacts still only existing as hypothetical projections. Rising temperatures, changing oceans, and the other challenges associated with climate change are almost impossible to represent in the visual language we are accustomed to. As a \\u201ctechnologically induced\\u201d environmental issue, climate change is largely \\u201cinaccessible to the senses\\u201d, and therefore difficult to present as a hazard or risk (Allen et al. 2000, 3).      As a result, few communications scholars and climate change researchers have bothered to examine the visual images presented in mass media coverage or other communications materials. In many of the published studies examining public discourse about climate change, textual content has been the sole focus of analysis. Images, whether photographs, illustrations, or diagrams, tend to be considered mere \\u201csupplements\\u201d to the accompanying written content, and therefore not relevant to the specific study at hand (Remillard 2011, 129).  15      Within the last decade, that trend has slowly begun to shift, with a handful of scholars beginning to pay attention to the types of images and image content associated with climate change publications and news content (Br\\u00f6nnimann 2002, Doyle 2007, Smith and Joffe 2009, Hulme 2009b, Manzo 2010). While these studies do develop new insights into the cultural significance of climate change images, the reports are limited primarily to examining images generated within British media or non-governmental organization campaign materials. Currently, there are no studies that compare images between international publications, or examine materials specifically presented on the Internet.      Two articles by British researchers examine images presented by non-governmental organizations for climate change action campaigns. One of the recent studies was completed by Julie Doyle, a lecturer at the University of Brighton. Her 2007 article, \\u201cPicturing the Clima(c)tic\\u201d, examines the photographs used in climate change campaigns by the international environmental organization, Greenpeace, over a fifteen-year period. Kate Manzo, a lecturer from Newcastle University, presents a similar discussion in her 2010 article, \\u201cImaging vulnerability: The iconography of climate change\\u201d. In the article, Manzo studied images from climate change action campaigns in Britain between 2007-2008.      While both studies limit their discussion to the examination of images within a social action campaign focus, they offer a great deal of useful discussion regarding the use of imagery within public discourse. Many of the images used in these types of climate action campaigns have parallels or tie-ins with media images, and both articles offer keen insight into the role of nature images and photography used to discuss environmental issues.       In her article, Manzo identifies two types of climate change campaigns, \\u201csocial marketing campaigns\\u201d, which emphasize an ethos of personal responsibility, and \\u201cbearing witness\\u201d  16 campaigns\\u201d, attempting to engage individuals as citizens and consumers (Manzo 2010, 96). The images used in the climate action campaigns, including images of melting glaciers and ice caps, operated as \\u201cvisual fingerprints\\u201d and \\u201charbingers\\u201d of climate change and its possible consequences (Manzo 2010, 96).  1.3 The Visual Spectacle  1.3.1 Photography        Before examining how images were specifically analyzed for this thesis, it\\u2019s important to discuss terminology in greater detail, starting with a brief description of how the term \\u201cimages\\u201d is utilized. In this thesis, the term \\u201cimages\\u201d refers to visual content produced to illustrate or describe the concept of global warming. This visual content is limited to work created in the public realm, posted on the Internet and produced by mass media outlets, non- governmental organizations, or educational organizations.      The visual content described and examined in this research is primarily photographic, either entirely composed of a single photographic image, or using photographic images in combination with illustrative elements and other photographs in montage. The images examined are visually realistic, or contain identifiable elements (i.e. planet Earth).      For centuries, humans have used visual imagery to document events, illustrate myths, convey sacred beliefs, and record political and economic structures. Containing sophisticated and coded references to social norms, historical legacies, and cultural attitudes, visual images are singularly powerful elements in our society. In order to fully engage with a study of  17 visual images, it is essential to appreciate their pivotal role in Western culture, and their impact on our daily lives (Burnett 2004, 8-10, Berger 1973, Lidchi 1999, Sontag 2001).       Technological innovations, like the development of printing press and photography, have altered our relationship to visual representations in countless ways (Benjamin 1936). Older methods of visual representation, like painting, have been produced for centuries as unique, one-time creations, subject to the whims of the artist and often intended for limited viewing within one home or building. With the development of printing technology, images could be reproduced in multiple copies, extending not only the potential audience for the image but also expanding the artist\\u2019s meanings and intentions of the visual image.       With the emergence of photography, the public\\u2019s relationship to visual images shifted once again. Developed during the nineteenth century, photography re-conceptualized the world in a multitude of new ways for viewers. A radically new form of visual presentation and mediated largely by technology and chemistry, photography was a true product of the industrial age. Mechanical and technological processes were embodied within the photograph, distinguishing photographic reproduction from painted or hand-drawn images (Benjamin 1936, Flusser 1983, Crary 1999, Wheeler 2002).      For media producers and newspaper editors, photography was adopted as another means of communicating with their target audience. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, hand- drawn illustrations published in news journals increased circulation numbers and brought in more revenue. With advances in print technology, photography eventually replaced hand- drawn illustrations. Quicker to produce, photographs came to be considered to be reliable records, an \\u201cimmortal\\u201d archive of public events (Schwartz 2003, 28, Sontag 2001, 11).  18      As theorists have noted, photography altered viewers\\u2019 visual perspectives, presenting the world as a two-dimensional, silent, monochrome image. The world seen through the lens of a camera was literally flattened and frozen. Mass-printed and produced, images could be replicated endlessly, and distributed to audiences living many miles away. The natural world, as seen through the photograph lens and printed in multiple copies for viewers, became a \\u201cnew nature\\u201d, framed in a way never before conceptualized (Elliot 2006, 147, Bell 2002).      With the development of photography, visual perception was isolated, removed from the world of tactile understanding and privileged as a primary method of transmitting and receiving information. The photograph effectively abstracted the real world, transforming the subjects seen through the lens into objects that were simultaneously familiar and mysterious. The camera became an instrument of control, rapidly appropriating images while also decontextualizing them (Lidchi 1999, 89, Barthes 1984, Flusser 1983, Sontag 2001).      There is an odd tension existing between our cultural associations of \\u201creality\\u201d in photography, and the actual technical complexities of producing a photograph. The mechanical and chemical processes that produced a photograph supposedly rendered it a verifiable document, recording the world with impartiality and accuracy (Perlmutter 2003, Schwartz 2003). However, the practice of photography has always included numerous opportunities for editorializing, editing, and alteration. From the initial composition of an image seen through a lens, to the multitude of \\u201chand-made\\u201d alterations that happen within the darkroom, lab, or editing suite, photography has always included multiple opportunities for human intervention (Wheeler 2002).      While most individuals tend to regard photographs as fixed and stable entities, it is more valuable to understand photographic images as dynamic, referring not only to one moment in  19 time but also to multiple moments, multiple sources of engagement, and multiple modes of understanding. Photographs may indicate a particular event, but they also bear innumerable traces of cultural expectations and assumptions, including our need for historical archives to \\u201cvalidate\\u201d collective memory (Burnett 2004,  23-29).      The desire to understand photographs as \\u201creal\\u201d played a key role in their establishment as significant elements of the news-making process.  Since photographs were included in news journals in the nineteenth century, photography has become a privileged component of mass media production. These photographs, considered impartial \\u201cwindows on the world\\u201d, have often become image icons, showing pivotal political and social events for eager news audiences (Perlmutter 2003, Schwartz 2003).      The role of photographs within mass media production is to illustrate specific stories, and to provide visual context for viewers and audiences. Photographs, more than text, can translate the content of a story more rapidly, so editors highlight photographs within both the printed and online versions of a publication. Photographs that contain particularly striking visual images of drama, tension, or suffering, may be labeled \\u201ciconic\\u201d, and featured prominently within a news publication. Pivotal iconic images, often taken under duress during times of war or disaster, may be reproduced and awarded for their photographic or editorial qualities.      But it is just this type of reverence for news photography that is problematic, as photojournalism, no more so than photography itself, cannot faithfully record the world in a measurable way. As mentioned previously, photographs are never impartial, but are carefully cropped, composed, and edited versions of an event or situation. According to one writer, this is the \\u201cbig lie\\u201d of photojournalism, as photographic images are chosen to convey specific  20 information about events to an audience, acting as a \\u201cpolitical construct\\u201d as much as documentation of an event (Pelmutter 2003, 11-17).  1.3.2 The digital universe       Like the printing press and photography in earlier centuries, the development of digital technology and the Internet has irrevocably altered public discourse. With the rapid acceleration of our networked and multi-platform society, images and information is now circulated at dizzying speeds. The impact of digital technology on the dissemination of information is extensive, echoing the chaotic transition period following the development of the Gutenberg Press in the sixteenth century (Shirky 2009).      With these advances, it is almost impossible to appreciate how many images flash before our eyes during any given day. Advertisements, news broadcasts, online journals, social media feeds, and a multitude of other sources push image after image into our consciousness. Monitoring an array of backlit screens on laptops and smartphones, citizens spend their waking moments swimming in an endless \\u201cspectacle\\u201d of photographs, illustrations, and animation (Debord 1967, Crary 1999, Flusser 1983).       Predictably, our society\\u2019s understanding and relationship to images has shifted as digital technology has developed. While the industrial replication of images has been part of Western culture for centuries, the advent of digital technology has allowed us to copy, replicate, alter, crop, manipulate and distribute images more easily than ever before. Technology has, once more, launched us into an age where the aura of an original artwork is almost impossible to locate (Benjamin [1936] 1969).  21      With the development of digital technology, new concerns about integrity and veracity have surfaced, notably within the context of news photojournalism. The widespread use of inexpensive software allowing the seamless alteration of images has stimulated discussion and consternation about the appropriate use of technology to alter photographs for a media audience, leading to a declining level of trust in the photograph as a \\u201ctrusted vehicle of truth\\u201d (Schwartz 2003, 30, Wheeler 2002).      The practice of photography has, however, always involved manipulation of some sort. From the earliest development of the medium, photographers have altered their images according to whim and desire, carefully posing subjects for the lens, and using various processing techniques to produce a \\u201cperfect\\u201d image. Altering pixels in Photoshop then is only the latest technological development in a century of photographic experimentation.      Contemporary consumption of images is undercut continually with tension, between the \\u201creal\\u201d and the \\u201cfake\\u201d. Real events in the world are continually transformed into images for our consumption, but our proximity to the event is so distant that we are unable to trust the image implicitly. This shift means that images no longer act simply as static representations of the world, but act now as \\u201cmediators\\u201d connecting humans and technology, \\u201cas much reference points for information and knowledge as visualizers of human creativity\\u201d (Burnett 2004 xiv, Sontag 2001).      How does the digital universe operate as a forum for public discourse? Theorists have debated the potentials and pitfalls of the new era of online communication, alternately heralding the opportunities for progressive sharing of information, and critiquing the corporate culture of the Internet. The sheer volume of content online has caused concern for some, potentially undermining \\u201cpolitical opportunity and efficacy\\u201d (Dean 2010).  22      The development of digital technology and the Internet has impacted mass media outlets dramatically, as new modes of publication begin to dominate the public sphere (Castells 2000, Sunstein 2002, Curran 2002, Shirky 2008). With the emergence of new media technologies, the relationship between mass media and audiences is rapidly being altered. Passive consumers are now transformed into active, participatory partners, or \\u201cusers\\u201d, offering new opportunities for engagement and interaction (Shirky 2008, boyd 2010, Jenkins 2006).      With images now dominating our interactions with new media, developing effective critiques of their significance is even more crucial. Even more than analogue images, digital images evoke layers of complex meaning and cultural associations for viewers. Digital images are no longer static, fixed images, but act as \\u201cmultimedia arrays\\u201d that can be interpreted in multiple ways and engender multiple realities (Perlmutter 2003, 20, Burnett 2004, Rose 2007).  1.4 A Sublime Landscape  1.4.1 The search for Eden       While analyzing the technology of production, presentation and display of images provides one key node of analysis, it is also essential to consider the content of an image. Content, perhaps more than any other ingredient, translates meaning and coded significance to the viewer, detailing a specific vision of the world from creator to audience (Rose 2007 2, Hall 1997).  23      Many of the images examined in this thesis present a particular vision of the natural world, using iconic content that conforms to specific rhetorical constructions related to the natural world.  As Western culture has re-shaped the natural world over centuries, so has our cultural relationship to the natural world also been re-worked and re-navigated, expressed in changing modes of visual expression and creative production. As a number of critics have noted, images of the natural world in Western culture recall an ever-shifting tension between ideals of nature-as-resource and nature-as-divine (Remillard 2010, 132, Wilson 1990, Daniels and Cosgrove 1998, Elliot 2006).      The place of nature photography and filmmaking has a particular significance here, as photographic technology has shaped our perception of the natural world within the last century. Just like news photojournalism, nature photography has been seen to present a particular vision of the world that is impartial and authentic. Photographs of the natural world, more than paintings or hand-drawn illustrations, are \\u201cwindows on the world\\u201d, providing a glimpse of landscapes, creatures and ecosystems that are apparently untainted by human concerns (Bous\\u00e9 2003).      As many critics have noted, however, the production and practice of nature photography and filmmaking has never been this simplistic. These visual presentations of the natural world are just as subject to the vagaries of technology and the whims of the photographer as any other type of archival documentation. As Bous\\u00e9 notes, \\u201c\\u2026the status of nature films and photographs as reliable science inscription, factual reportage, or documentary evidence is in question\\u201d (Bous\\u00e9 2003, 235, Mitman 1999).      Despite this, the vision of the natural world presented in wildlife and nature photography over the last century has not strayed significantly, as images of unpopulated, untouched  24 wilderness continue to be generated and re-produced. Evoking the 18th century Romantic notion of the sublime, contemporary wilderness photographs and films continue to showcase the natural world as a pristine environment, stripped of all references to the modern world (Bell 2002, 7, Elliot 2006).      Despite these criticisms, idealized images of a pristine natural world continue to be circulated widely, including in the digital domain. This visual conception of the natural world as a place of refuge that exists separately from human culture is not merely aesthetic fancy, but is only the latest embodiment of Western culture\\u2019s complex relationship to the natural world. Visual images showing only untouched, un-spoilt landscapes echo a \\u201cdream of an unworked natural landscape\\u201d, a dualistic ideal that underscores contemporary cultural alienation from the natural world (Cronon 1996, 80-81, Wilson 1990, Bell 2002).  1.4.2 Virgin ice and polar animals       Many of the types of images utilized within climate change coverage and campaigns tend to correspond with this aesthetic of the depopulated and de-cultured landscape. These kinds of images are not new, but have been central to the discourse surrounding environmental politics for decades, arguably since landscape photographs in the late 1800s were utilized to argue for the establishment of conservation areas in the United States (Deluca 1999, xii, Dobrin 2009, 7, Cronon 1996).      One of the predominant types of image associated with climate change utilizes this aesthetic of the idealized landscape. For the purposes of this thesis, these images show \\u201cice\\u201d in some type of specific scenario and location, linked to the widespread popular concern that rising global temperatures are causing the melting of glacial and polar ice regions (Doyle  25 2007). These images are predominantly photographs, showing mountain glaciers, icebergs, or ice and snow in the Arctic and Antarctica (see Figure 5 for examples of these images).       Contemporary photographs depicting the Arctic and Antarctic regions as depopulated, \\u201cunsullied\\u201d wildernesses recall not only the \\u201cpicturesque\\u201d tradition of 18th century English landscape painting, but also the work of Canadian landscape painters like the Group of Seven, known for their iconographic representations of the North. Famous for paintings of snow-capped mountain peaks and icy vistas, Canadian artists like Lawren Harris\\u2019 presented an idealized view of the North that was \\u201cpure\\u201d, \\u201cvirginal\\u201d and \\u201ctimeless\\u201d, devoid of human (particularly aboriginal) communities (Osborne 1988, 171-172, Elliot 2006, 99).      This cultural context is, however, rarely commented upon or critiqued. It is true that images associated with the concept of \\u201cmelting ice\\u201d (including photographs of icebergs, glaciers, and the polar regions) have been a predominant ingredient for mass media and public discourse concerning climate change (Smith 2009, O\\u2019Neill and Nicolson-Cole 2009). Few studies, however, have bothered to examine these images closely, or contextualize their historical and cultural importance.      There is no doubt that images of glaciers, icebergs and polar ice are visually persuasive, using the rugged beauty of these environments to capture the dramatic scale and impact of climate change (Smith 2009). But these images are also problematic, gaining legitimacy by idealizing an aestheticized vision of the landscape. By presenting visions of distant, de- populated regions, these images effectively \\u201crelegat[e] climate change impacts to a remote and inaccessible place\\u201d (Doyle 2007, 142).      For contemporary viewers, photographic images of glaciers, icebergs and polar ice not only de-historicize (and de-politicize) the issue of climate change. These types of images are  26 also unable to effectively communicate the very issue they are linked to. As photography privileges the present moment in visual form, these images simultaneously attempt to signify a long term, developmental issue that is primarily unseen, or only visible over time (Doyle 2007, 129-130).      As Doyle noted in her study of climate change campaign literature, the use of photographs depicting cracking polar ice shelves and melting glaciers for environmental campaigns was additionally complex. By showing photographs of climate change impacts (i.e. the cracking of the Larsen B shelf in Antarctica), that have already happened, an artificial tension is set in place between the effects that have occurred, and the campaign\\u2019s efforts to prevent similar impacts occurring in the future (Doyle 2007, 129-131). These photographs operate as \\u201cevidence\\u201d designed to convince the viewer of the impacts of climate change, but the complexities of environmental claims and scientific research remain unacknowledged in these images (Oreskes 2004).  1.4.3 Burning Earth       Another significant image that appears repeatedly to illustrate articles about climate change contain visual references to heat, flames or fire. More specifically, many images show representations of a \\u201cburning\\u201d planet Earth (see Figure 3 for examples). In these images, a photograph or an illustration of planet Earth is layered with images of fire, flames or heat.       Images of planet Earth recall the \\u201cclassic\\u201d photographs taken of Earth during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission, NASA\\u2019s eleventh manned spaced mission (NASA \\u201cVisible Earth\\u201d, accessed 2011). Taken from a \\u201cGod\\u2019s-eye\\u201d viewpoint of approximately 45,000 km above the  27 planet\\u2019s surface, the photographs from Apollo 17 showed an un-shadowed Earth set against a backdrop of dark space. The first photographs to show the Earth floating as a planet in space, the images of a stunning \\u201cblue marble\\u201d would become some of the most widely reproduced photographs in human history (Sagan 1994, Cosgrove 2010).      The Apollo 17 photographs became a powerful icon for the environmental and other social movements, acting as a visual stand-in for concepts like global unity, international cooperation, and the fragility of natural ecosystems. However, the cultural associations generated by the image of planet Earth can also be seen as potentially problematic, embodying a de-politicized and de-historicized discourse linked to imperialism and colonialization (Bossen 1985, 2, Ingold 1993, 31-32, Cosgrove 2001, 263, Jasanoff 2004, Cosgrove 2010).      After being adopted by environmental campaigns, it was only a matter of time before images of the Earth were utilized to signify an issue like climate change. In 2007, for example, a series of massive 24-hour public \\u201cLive Earth\\u201d concerts on seven continents organized by Al Gore to draw attention to climate change efforts used photographs of the Earth extensively in backdrops and promotional materials (Manzo 2010, 98).      Images of the planet Earth have also been used to denote rising temperatures and global warming, often layered with images of flames or tinted with the colour red (Manzo 2010, 98, Doyle 2007, 138, Smith 2009). But, as Manzo notes, any attempt to present a visual image of a warming planet is inherently politicized. Any \\u201cgeopolitical visions of the present and the past\\u201d embody much of our unspoken cultural expectations regarding the changing natural world, often incorporating Western discourses of unity and diversity, as well as identifying  28 the global South as a \\u201czone of vulnerability in need of Western intervention and rescue\\u201d (Manzo 2010, 97, 105).   29 2    Chapter: ONLINE IMAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE   2.1  The digital scrapbook        For many contemporary writers and theorists, the digital sphere is often described in utopic terms, highlighting endless \\u201csmooth\\u201d flows of data and information unhampered by borders, boundaries, or limits. Cyberspace is perceived as a slick realm of images and text, and \\u201cusers\\u201d are techno-wizard tourists, surfing lightly through a tidal wave that is continuously re-circulated and re-freshed (van Loon 2000, Castells 2000).      An examination of online information could echo this framework, by producing surveys and analysis that emphasize the capture of data, comprehensive statistics, and conclusions asserted within the confines of academic expertise. Of course, such an analysis might threaten to perpetuate the idealized conceptualization of a digital realm of \\u201cendless and equal opportunity\\u201d, a view that has been critiqued as a \\u201cfantasy\\u201d (Dean 2010).      By examining online content with reference to cultural, historical and social context, and by re-visiting another form of \\u201ctechnology\\u201d that exists in opposition to the hyper-modernist arena of cyberspace, this project is an attempt to re-interpret, or interrupt, this model.      Introduced briefly in the first chapter of this thesis, my battered, blue photo scrapbook is an example of an outdated form of information and image storage, and it serves as a kind of model for this research project. Rooted in the domestic realm, the collection and display of personalized images and text recall contemporary forms of online social media, but contain none of the smoothness of digital technology. Containing torn scraps of paper, hand- scribbled notes, and cheaply printed photographs attached with tape and glue, the scrapbook is an anachronistic forum for memory and nostalgia.  30      As a model for this project, the scrapbook can potentially function as a forum for investigating image and content, and a multi-layered bricolage pulling from disparate sources (Benjamin 2002, Sontag 2001). As a messy, non-smooth technology, the scrapbook model up-ends assumptions about digital content, re-linking the digital realm with the pre-digital models of information management that are still in social circulation, despite our desires to be liberated of the untidy models of the past. By utilizing an unusual format, the disruption of \\u201ca certain drive to clarity [and] transparency\\u2026in a translucent text\\u201d may offer new opportunities for discussion and debate (Deluca 1999, xiii).      In some regards, the scrapbook also evokes elements of the digital information gathering process. Absorbing information online is decidedly less linear than research using traditional print materials, as users are confronted with multiple layers of images, text, and references through overlapping windows and parallel programs. There is a haphazard nature to the experience of finding information online, bearing the traces of other users who have altered, commented, and interpreted the information in various ways.      Like a scrapbook, this project was not designed to be an exhaustive survey of online image content linked to climate change. Instead, a limited selection of images and websites was examined, offering enough material to generate some perspective on the content and context of images of climate change. This bundling of images is not meant to provide an authoritative overview of data, but instead attempts to approach the representation of climate change in a new way.      With this model, I\\u2019m not only interested in investigating the framework of our conceptions of the digital world, but also in re-invigorating some of the academic dialogue concerning climate change research. As some writers have acknowledged, the phenomenon  31 of climate change is not a discrete, simple problem that responds well to \\u201celegant\\u201d, top-down policy initiatives, but is instead immensely complex (Prins and Rayner 2007, Hulme 2009b).  2.2 Examining sites / sights        As part of this \\u201cscrapbook\\u201d approach, several websites containing information about climate change were examined in detail, including the pages from two Google image searches, three media outlets, and four non-governmental organizations. In total, 485 images were surveyed according to content and format. While these sites cannot be considered all, or even a significant portion, of the content generated concerning climate change research, these websites do offer valuable perspectives concerning the climate change debate.      Images were examined from the chosen websites, and sorted according to twenty-two categories related to content and format, defined according to the type of climate change content depicted in the image. These categories included images of alternative energy (i.e. solar energy panels or wind farms), planet Earth, planet Earth on fire or with flames, extreme weather (i.e. floods or snowstorms), ice (i.e. glaciers, icebergs or polar regions), polar animals (i.e. penguins, polar bears), and smokestacks / air pollution (see Table 1 for a complete list of categories).  Alternative energy photograph Cartoon or other image photo / illus. Climate summit (i.e. Cancun, UN, etc.) photograph Displaced community / refugees photograph Environmental activism / protests photograph Environmental pollution /destruction photograph Extreme weather photograph Extreme weather / ice combo photo / illus. Fire / heat illustration  32 Fire / ice combo illustration Flooding illustration Globe photo / illus. Globe (fire/heat) illustration Globe (flooding) photo / illus. Graph or chart illustration Ice  photograph Ice / snow illustration Ice & polar animals photograph Other natural phenomenon photograph Polar animals  illustration Profiled person (political figure, etc.) photograph Smokestacks / air pollution photograph Table 1: Categories       The visual images examined were primarily photographs, but there were also a significant number that incorporated illustrative components, or were purely illustrative, including hand- drawn cartoons or graphics. Charts, diagrams and graphs were also noted as part of the project.      An overview of the websites will be examined initially, followed by an analysis of the content of the 485 images and a discussion of the findings of the research. The placement of climate change information on the pages was considered, in order to ascertain how prominently climate change content is placed within the site, and how easily users can access this information (the Google searches and IPCC site were not discussed in this way, as only climate change content was displayed on those pages).  2.2.1 Google searches        Google, an Internet search engine and advertising corporation establishing in 1998, dominates Internet searches, boasting 66% of Internet searches in the U.S. in recent months (Comscore 2010). In addition to indexing web pages, Google also offers a searchable catalog  33 of listed images. While some critics acknowledge that the technical parameters associated with Google searches may exclude relevant sites, as the predominant search engine it remains a useful index of images ranked by image tags, file titles, and text associated with the website (Nissenbaum 2000, Jing and Baluja 2008, Auletta 2009).      As part of this project, two Google image searches were conducted on February 3, 2011, using the terms \\u201cclimate change\\u201d and \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d. For the search term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d, over 51 million results were listed, while the search for \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d images posted over 55 million results. For both searches, the first two \\u201cpages\\u201d of each search were examined, resulting in approximately 150 images for each search.      The sources for these images come from a variety of web pages, including mass media, activist or non-governmental organizations\\u2019 publications and educational material.  Sorted according to page rank and tags, the Google pages are akin to a scrap bag of images sorted according to Google\\u2019s algorithms. Each page displays a rich repository of photographs and illustrations, dominated by the \\u201cfire\\u201d and \\u201cice\\u201d images that provided the inspiration for this project (see Figure 1 for a screenshot of the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d search).   34  Figure 1: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the first twenty-five images listed in a Google \\\"global warming\\\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=       The \\u201cfire\\u201d images were the dominant image type in the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d image search, presumably because of the verbal link between heat and \\u201cwarming\\u201d. These pages had multiple illustrations or of planet Earth touched by every type of heat source imaginable, from candles and matches to stove elements and large suns with solar rays. These illustrations were particularly colourful, contrasting the \\u201cblue marble\\u201d of Earth with the red, orange and yellow of the heat source (see Figure 2).   35  Figure 2: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of seven \\u201cburning earth\\u201d images, sourced from a Google \\\"global warming\\\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=        The globe, as pictured in these illustrations, echoes the original Apollo 17 photographs, showing the planet centered in the middle of the frame and lit by daylight. These images, however, are not exact replicas of the original photographs. In the original Apollo  36 photographs, the continent of Africa is centrally placed, and the southern pole region is visible at the bottom of the planet. Like many reproductions published since 1972, the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d images have illustrated the planet in a different configuration, erasing the continent of Africa and tilting the axis of the globe to place North America in a visually dominant position (Cosgrove 2010, 86).      While the central placement of the globe in the frame does echo the Apollo photographs, it emphasizes the status of the planet as isolated, suspended against a dark or blank background. In a number of illustrations, the globe is also scaled as a tiny sphere, small enough to fit inside a match flame, or be cradled in a human hand. Engulfed by flames, these images depict planet Earth as fragile and vulnerable, susceptible to frightening forces that are beyond control. As a \\u201clonely speck\\u201d adrift in an unfriendly cosmos, these images recall images of the globe used in environmental campaigns, demanding that we \\u201cmake a stand\\u201d to save the planet (Sagan 1994, Jasanoff 2005, Manzo 2010, Cosgrove 2010).      In the Google searches, the \\u201cice\\u201d images were also striking, and were evident in both the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d and \\u201cclimate change\\u201d searches. The images of glaciers, icebergs and polar regions were primarily photographs, and represented the opposite colour palette to the \\u201cfire\\u201d images, with crisp white and ivory expanses contrasted with deep blue, emerald green, and black expanses of water or rock. While these images are generally more concrete than the fanciful burning Earth illustrations, the \\u201cice\\u201d images still evoked a specific view of the natural world.      In each of these photographs, the icy regions are depicted without any evidence of human presence. The vistas are grand and magnificent, almost alien with their vast emptiness and dramatic formations of ice and snow. But even with the minimalist display, an internal  37 message is still evident and easily accessible to contemporary viewers. There can be little doubt that these images are linked to climate change content or context. One image, for example, is a composite of two photographs, comparing a glaciated region over an eighty- year period. Another image shows a landscape of snow-peaked mountains undercut with a layered image of dry, cracked earth.      Sourced from online news outlets, aggregator sites, and environmental blogs, these photographs show that the snow and ice of the polar regions and mountain ranges are melting, quite literally. One photograph, for example, focuses on a melting water droplet from an ice shelf, isolating this element from the blue glacial ice in the background. Another shot depicts a splash as ice cracks from an iceberg and crashes into deep water (see Figure 3).     38  Figure 3: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of five photographs of glaciers, icebergs and polar ice, sourced from a Google \\\"climate change\\\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=         Images of polar animals, particularly polar bears, also were evident in the Google searches. While massive numbers of organisms are threatened in multiple ecosystems around the planet as a result of a changing climate, polar bears have become identified with climate change in a unique and specific way. As a number of writers have noted, polar bears have become visual markers of a species that is vulnerable to climate change, and their image is  39 used with in conjunction with climate change information perhaps more than any other species (Hulme 2009b, 242).      Designated as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2008 despite controversy, the polar bear is the first species to be given this status due to the impact of climate change (Wiess 2008). In the Google searches, a few illustrations or cartoons of polar bears were evident, but most of the images were photographs. The photographs in particular are aesthetically similar, with the bears viewed from a distance or from an aerial view. The ivory-furred bears are part of the visually dramatic polar landscape, standing out against the bleak ice and dark water.     These types of photographs of polar bears are used frequently, evident on magazine covers and scientific research reports (Time 2006, ACIA 2005).  While these images fit into the conventions of photojournalism or wildlife photography, there is an underlying message that corresponds with the other \\u201cmelting\\u201d motif images. These photographs of polar bears embody a dialogue of isolation, vulnerability and instability that reverberates through climate change discussions. Pictured alone or in small groups on fractured ice floes or adrift in deep water, the polar bear\\u2019s status as an endangered species is underscored. Frequently, images are circulated of a bear balanced precariously on an ice floe that has melted, and looks particularly unstable or dangerous (see Figure 4).   40  Figure 4: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of five photographs of polar bears, sourced from a Google \\\"climate change\\\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=   2.2.2 Media outlets       In the past ten years, the rise of online technology has impacted print media dramatically, and newspaper publishers have suffered dramatic losses in readership and revenue as audiences gather more information from online sources (Pew 2011). To use Marshall McLuhan\\u2019s terminology, the \\u201chot\\u201d world of exclusionary, output-based print content has lost  41 ground to the \\u201ccool\\u201d medium of a new, participatory digital realm (McLuhan 1969). In a frantic effort to stay relevant, print publications have developed parallel online websites, publishing their print content as companion digital text, images, and multimedia.      Developing this online content in an era of decreasing budgets and changing technology has not been an easy process, and the websites associated with print media outlets often vary widely in the coverage and content offered online (Shirky 2009, Sack 2008, Sunstein 2009, Dean 2010,). Some sites are easier to navigate, and feature rapidly updated content, while other sites struggle to adapt to the demands of mediating comment streams, 24-hour news cycles, and the uncertain benefits of online advertising.      With these complexities in mind, the websites for three national newspapers from three countries were examined for this project: The Globe and Mail (Canada), The New York Times (U.S.), and the Guardian (U.K.). As linked to national and international \\u201cpapers of record\\u201d, these three websites differ in scale, size and budget, and feature varying levels of content and coverage.      While each of these media outlets do provide coverage of climate change issues, this coverage is presented online in different ways. The Globe and Mail, for example, does not have a stand-alone web page devoted to climate change issues, while The New York Times and the Guardian does. As well, the volume of content differs significantly between the three sites.      As a result, it was necessary to develop a slightly altered approach to examine the images associated with climate change coverage from these websites. A search for feature articles was conducted on each media website, using the terms \\u201cclimate change\\u201d and \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d. Fourteen of the most recent and relevant feature articles were examined from each  42 website, and their associated images were organized according to the twenty-two different categories noted previously. 2.2.2.1  The Globe and Mail        Of the three media outlets, The Globe and Mail is the smallest, focused on the production of an English-language newspaper distributed nationally in Canada. Based in Toronto and printed in six cities across the country, the newspaper features national and international news stories, and has a weekly readership of approximately 1 million (Audit Bureau of Circulation Report 2010).      The Globe and Mail\\u2019s website has been online for over ten years, and consists of the main news site (www.globeandmail.com), along with other linked websites corresponding both to newspaper sections and stand-alone financial management sites, as part of the \\u201cGlobe Web Centre\\u201d. The Globe and Mail website attracts an average of 600,000 readers daily, and 3.2 million unique visitors each month (Comscore Metrix 2010).      While there is no stand-alone \\u201cclimate change\\u201d page in The Globe and Mail website, stories about climate change are often featured prominently on a stand-alone \\u201cScience\\u201d web page. On February 3, 2011, for example, a climate change article was featured, placed on the left-hand side of the web page under a \\u201cclimate change\\u201d heading, illustrated with a photograph of workers monitoring equipment in the Alberta Tar Sands.  On the same day, other environmental articles and videos were highlighted under the headings \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d and \\u201cClimate\\u201d on the right hand side of the page (see Figure 5).   43       Figure 5: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of The Globe and Mail\\u2019s \\u201cScience\\u201d web page. Original source: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science/  2.2.2.2 The New York Times    In contrast to The Globe and Mail, The New York Times does feature a stand-alone page devoted to climate change issues. Widely regarded as a national \\u201cnewspaper of record\\u201d, The New York Times has been published continuously in the U.S. since 1851, and boasts one of the largest circulations in the country (Boston Globe 2010).  Despite falling circulation numbers for its print edition, the online edition of the Times attracts more than 30 million monthly unique visitors per month (Clabaugh 2010).       While at times subject to critique for its coverage of climate change (Hoggan 2010, 9), The New York Times has managed to devote sizable resources and space to environmental  44 coverage. Journalists Andrew Revkin and Elizabeth Rosenthal, for example, have been on the forefront of climate change coverage, writing many comprehensive and well-researched articles.      On The New York Times website, the stand-alone \\u201cclimate change\\u201d page is linked as a sub-heading on a third-tier \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d page, and is presented under the title \\u201cGlobal Warming\\u201d. On the Environment page, this page\\u2019s menu button is placed next to a small photo icon, depicting a polar bear striding on an ice floe. This tiny photograph is another example of the use of an iconic image, recalling the many images of polar animals and ice evident in the Google image searches (see Figure 6).  Figure 6: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of The New York Time\\u2019s \\u201cGlobal Warming\\u201d button icon located on their \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d webpage. Original source: http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/earth/index.html  2.2.2.3 The Guardian       In contrast to The Globe and Mail and The New York Times, even a rapid examination of the Guardian website reveals that a great deal of resources have been placed into their online climate change content. The web design of the Guardian site is much more sophisticated than either The Globe and Mail or The New York Times websites, with skillful use of colour, text, and interactive features. This impression is confirmed by statements from the organization, who proudly boast that their website embraces a \\u201cmutualized\\u201d approach to journalism with a strong emphasis on digital engagement (Guardian Media Group 2010).  45      The Guardian is a British national daily newspaper, with the third largest average daily circulation in the U.K. (Reynolds 2010). Formerly known as the Manchester Guardian, the Guardian has been financially supported by the not-for-profit Scott Trust since 1936 (Guardian Media Group 2010). While the print edition of the newspaper remains popular, the Guardian website also draws a large audience, generating approximately 35 million visitors per month (Reid 2010).      The Guardian features articles and opinion pieces by prominent environmental writers, including George Monbiot, who is internationally known for his work discussing climate change. On the Guardian website, an easily navigable top banner displays \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d as a key category, placed in the first tier of menu options and displayed in eye-catching green text. In contrast with The Globe and Mail and The New York Times, the Guardian\\u2019s \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d page is not linked as part of the \\u201cScience\\u201d and \\u201cTechnology\\u201d pages, but is a separate, stand-alone page (see Figure 7).   46  Figure 7: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the Guardian\\u2019s \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d webpage. Original source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment  2.2.2.4 Media sites summary        The Guardian\\u2019s \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d page features a second-tier list of menu options, with \\u201cClimate Change\\u201d as the second choice. This links to a stand-alone \\u201cClimate Change\\u201d page, featuring a mix of stories and images. As well, the \\u201cClimate Change\\u201d page lists another tier of clickable page options that are linked specifically to the issue: \\u201cCarbon Emissions\\u201d, \\u201cClimate Talks\\u201d, \\u201cEnergy\\u201d, \\u201cFossil Fuels\\u201d, and the \\u201cIPCC\\u201d. One separate page has even been created to address the \\u201cClimategate\\u201d issue, listed under a less controversial \\u201cHacked climate science emails\\u201d title  (see Figure 8).   47  Figure 8: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the Guardian\\u2019s \\u201cClimate Change\\u201d webpage. Original source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change         In the three media sites surveyed, the images associated with the climate change feature articles were all photographs, primarily containing subject matter that related in some way to the feature article. Captions were included, describing the specific content of each photograph and how it related to the article. Overall, the photographs on the media sites tended to be more specific in content, presented as straightforward \\u201cnews\\u201d photographs without the illustrative elements seen in the Google search images.  48       While the illustrative images of burning globes and melting glaciers were largely absent on the media sites, these websites still tended to present images that largely conformed to generalized content categories. But while \\u201cfire\\u201d and \\u201cice\\u201d images were less commonly used, other types of images were seen frequently, particularly photographs of smokestacks and extreme weather conditions (see section 2.3 for a more detailed examination).  2.2.3 Organizations       The websites of four organizations were surveyed for this project: Greenpeace International, the David Suzuki Foundation, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Geographic Society. While each of these organizations operates from a not-for-profit standpoint, the aims and relevance within the climate change community vary greatly for each group.      Two organizations (the David Suzuki Foundation and Greenpeace International) are environmental organizations, promoting public environmental campaigns with accompanying reports and promotional material designed for a general audience. While both organizations have different approaches to their public campaigns, the Suzuki Foundation and Greenpeace place climate change activism prominently in their online site, with stand-alone pages devoted to this content.  2.2.3.1 David Suzuki Foundation        Founded in 1991 by Canadian scientist and environmental activist David Suzuki, the David Suzuki Foundation advocates for various environmental issues, targeting a primarily  49 Canadian audience. Based in Vancouver, B.C., the Suzuki Foundation has approximately 40,000 individual donors, and an annual budget of approximately $ 7 million (David Suzuki Foundation 2010).      On the Suzuki Foundation website, images are used sparingly, and there is much less visual content than on the other websites examined. Overall, the majority of visual images depicted generalized content linked to the subject of each article or page. In fact, each photograph appeared to be stock photographs, with no recognizable identifying trait or feature distinguishing it as an original shot taken for the organization specifically.      On the pages featuring climate change content, the displayed photographs fit into a number of different categories. On the \\u201cScience and Policy\\u201d page, for example, there are three photographs listed under the title, \\u201cClimate Change Basics\\u201d, depicting a set of smokestacks, clouds rising from a smokestack, and a wind turbine. Other images found on the climate change content pages of the website included photographs of glaciers, polar ice, and extreme weather (see Figure 9).  50  Figure 9: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the David Suzuki Foundation\\u2019s \\u201cScience and Policy\\u201d webpage. Original source: http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate- change/science/         Like the Suzuki Foundation, the Greenpeace International website features a stand-alone page devoted to climate change information. Established in 1970 in Vancouver, BC, Greenpeace gained prominence with widely publicized, \\u201cmedia savvy\\u201d activist campaigns targeting various environmental issues, including international whaling operations and offshore drilling (Dale 1996). Relying on individual donations and foundation grants, the organization now has an international office based in Amsterdam, and a multi-million dollar annual budget (Greenpeace 2010).      While there are photographs related to specific Greenpeace activist campaigns on their website, there are also a number of images that fit with the generalized content seen on other websites. On the \\u201cStop climate change\\u201d page, a large photograph of an alternative energy  51 wind farm is displayed.  Below this image, there is a photograph of smokestacks. And on the \\u201cGlobal Melting\\u201d page, describing the impacts of climate change, a picture of polar ice is featured (see Figure 10).  Figure 10: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of Greenpeace International\\u2019s \\u201cClimate Change\\u201d webpage. Original source: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/        A photograph of polar bears is also evident, used on a \\u201cPlease donate\\u201d link near their climate change content, and also on the  \\u201cArctic and Antarctic\\u201d climate change information page. The photograph depicts a polar bear in a precarious position, jumping onto an adjacent ice floe over a dark current of water below, another example of the image of a polar bear used as a recurring and familiar icon of climate change (see Figure 11).   52  Figure 11: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of Greenpeace International\\u2019s \\u201cPlease donate\\u201d button on their \\u201cArctic Impacts\\u201d webpage. Original source: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/       Images of \\u201ccharismatic\\u201d animals (i.e. polar bears, whales, etc.) have been used often in Greenpeace campaigns, partly as a tool to elicit public response (Dale 1996). One campaign director for a local Greenpeace office stated last fall in an interview that \\u201c\\u2026[p]eople definitely respond to charismatic megafauna, like whales [and] polar bears\\u2026Images of destruction and animals in distress invoke a response for sure - it helps them understand what\\u2019s at risk or what\\u2019s at stake\\u201d (Interview conducted November 10, 2010 - Greyson 2010). A communications director for another Vancouver-based environmental organization agreed, saying, \\u201c[w]e always try to get images of a creature that people can relate to, like a marine mammal.\\u201d (Interview conducted November 12, 2010 - Greyson 2010). In an attempt to solicit attention and support, environmental organizations continue to rely on the use images of recognizable flagship species with iconic appeal (Clucas, McHugh and Caro 2008).     53 2.2.3.2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change       While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does not engage in the same types of public campaigns that Greenpeace and the Suzuki Foundation do, it is recognized as a leading authority and disseminator of climate change information and content. Founded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the IPCC is widely recognized as an international authority on the scientific research concerning climate change, generating reports based on recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information (IPCC website, accessed 2010).        As a generator of scientific and technical reports, the IPCC website pages are predominantly text-based. As this project was concerned with digital images displayed on accessible webpages, the scientific diagrams located within the reports were examined, but not included as part of the content study. Instead, the digital scans of the report covers of the IPCC reports posted on the website were surveyed, as these images contained the illustrative content useful to this study. While these images were not given additional illustrative elements (like fire or flames, for example), the images were still generalized photographs that conformed to many of the content categories in this survey. Photographic images of planet Earth, for example, did recur several times. In the sample screenshot, the 2007 IPCC reports show two images of the globe \\u2013 one using a photographic representation similar to the Apollo image, and one using a traditional map layout. Other images showed alternative energy projects, extreme weather, or smokestacks or air pollution (see Figure 12).   54   Figure 12: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of four report covers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\u2019s 2007 Fourth Assessment Report series. Original source: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml   2.2.3.3 National Geographic Society        In contrast to the other organizations, the National Geographic Society is not primarily identified as an advocacy group for environmental causes. While their mandate is educational, with a focus on the promotion and conservation of natural and cultural resources, the organization is primarily identified as a media outlet responsible for the publication of iconic, widely distributed magazines and multimedia content.      Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the National Geographic Society was established in 1888, and is perhaps best well known for their flagship magazine publication, National Geographic. This magazine features photo-essays and text content, and is published in 28 languages and with an estimated circulation of 30-50 million. Natural history and ecological issues are some of the key subjects covered in the magazine, which features full-colour, iconic photographic content (Remillard 2011).  55       Like the magazine, the National Geographic website features large-scale photographs, placed more prominently then images on the other websites surveyed. Many of these photographs are dramatic landscapes shot in vivid colour, similar to the visual iconography featured in the print magazines published by the Society. These photo-essays, while ostensibly presenting a conservationist ethic, often present an ambiguous vision of environmental risk (Remillard 2010, 139).       On the website, images illustrating climate change content conform to the idealized photographs reproduced on calendars and tourist postcards. Landscapes, for example, are shown largely as depopulated, without evidence of human communities. Other images show \\u201ccharismatic\\u201d or \\u201cflagship\\u201d wildlife species, usually mammals that are \\u201cmemorable\\u201d and easily recognized (Clucas et al. 2008, 1518).        For example, on the day the site was surveyed (February 9, 2011), the \\u201cGlobal Warming\\u201d page featured a prominent photograph of \\u201crapidly shrinking\\u201d Greenland ice, displayed with the title \\u201cMelt Zone\\u201d. This photograph echoes other \\u201cice\\u201d images illustrating climate change from the Google image search. Shot from a low angle against a pale blue sky, the white formations are particularly dramatic, curving above a vivid blue stream of water that slices through the core of the ice (see Figure 13).   56  Figure 13: Figure removed for copyright reasons.

Original source: http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/?source=NavEnvGlobal        Below the main feature photograph on the \\u201cGlobal Warming\\u201d page, three other photographs depict other idealized, photogenic landscapes. One photograph, linked to a page titled \\u201cEffects\\u201d, shows an image of a snow-topped mountain range with wildflowers in the foreground. Another photograph shows glistening sea ice in front of a setting sun, and another depicts a brilliant white iceberg set against a blue sky.      While the photographs on the National Geographic website display skilled composition and beautiful aesthetics, they echo the de-personalized stock photos displayed on the Suzuki Foundation website. Each photograph slots in to the accompanying subject matter, like an icon from a children\\u2019s colouring book. On the \\u201cCauses\\u201d page, for example, a large  57 photograph of four smokestacks is featured, showing billowing clouds of smoke (greenhouse gas emissions? Steam?) clouding the sky (see Figure 14).   Figure 14: Figure removed for copyright reasons.

After months of skimming through online content, these visual landmarks become evident everywhere I look. Silent, icy landscapes and steadfast polar bears pop up on magazine covers, for example (see Nature, Dec. 16, 2010). In news items, book covers, and campaign materials, planets burn helplessly, and factories belch billowing clouds into hazy skies.      These formulaic compositions aren\\u2019t simply anomalies, but form a dense, recursive patchwork of images. While articles, essays and reports discuss the endlessly varying minutiae of rapidly changing government policy, research findings, and public debate, the images illustrating this content perform the opposite function, cycling through a pat, narrow set of visual options that are numbingly familiar.      For this project, defining the content of the surveyed images indicates a pattern of predominant, even iconic images illustrating climate change. In the Google image searches, for example, \\u201cfire\\u201d and \\u201cice\\u201d images are continuously recycled. Images of planet Earth, for example, were the most common, accounting for 28.6% of the surveyed images, with approximately half of these images displaying a fire or heat motif.      Images of ice were also commonly found in the Google searches. Photographs of ice, glaciers and polar caps accounted for 12.7% of the images generated in the two searches, and photographs of ice and polar images represented 7.1% of the total images. Of the total 308  59 images examined in the Google searches, 72 contained some reference to ice, accounting for 22.4%. By adding images of polar animals without ice, the total number rises to 24.3%.       One point of comparison between the two Google image searches is the different number of graphs and charts, which accounted for 16.1% of the total images in the \\u201cclimate change\\u201d search, but only 3.3% in the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d search. As the term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d is more prominently used by agencies and organizations that are responsible for academic and policy discussions and dissemination of information (including scientific research, professional organizations, and government bodies), this may explain this discrepancy.      As well, photographs of extreme weather were represented in the \\u201cclimate change\\u201d search (3.2%), and an additional 2.6% of the images depicting extreme weather combined with ice, for a combined total of 5.8%. In contrast, there were no images of extreme weather or extreme weather combined with ice in the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d search.      In the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d search, images of planet Earth (represented with fire elements and without) were predominant, accounting for 34.7% of the total images. In contrast, images of planet Earth (represented with fire elements and without) accounted for only 22.5% of the total images of the \\u201cclimate change\\u201d search.      In the \\u201cclimate change\\u201d search, other images were more commonly represented. For example, images of smokestacks or air pollution accounted for 12.3% of the images surveyed. In comparison, only 3.9% of the images listed in the \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d search depicted air pollution or smokestacks.      There were some images of extreme weather, but some types of images were absent. For example, there were no images of alternative energy sources, like wind farms or solar power (see Table 2).  60    GOOGLE SEARCHES (combined)   TOTAL % Globe (fire/heat) illustration 45 14.6 Cartoon or other image photo / illus. 45 14.6 Globe photo / illus. 43 14.0 Ice  photograph 39 12.7 Graph or chart illustration 30 9.7 Smokestacks / air pollution photograph 25 8.1 Ice & polar animals photograph 22 7.1 Fire / heat illustration 19 6.2 Flooding illustration 11 3.6 Polar animals  illustration 6 1.9 Extreme weather photograph 5 1.6 Ice / snow illustration 4 1.3 Extreme weather / ice combo photo / illus. 4 1.3 Climate summit (i.e. Cancun, UN, etc.) photograph 4 0.0 Fire / ice combo illustration 3 0.0 Globe (flooding) photo / illus. 1 0.0 Environmental activism / protests photograph 1 0.0 Displaced community / refugees photograph 1 0.0 Profiled person (political figure, etc.) photograph 0 0.0 Other natural phenomenon photograph 0 0.0 Environmental pollution /destruction photograph 0 0.0 Alternative energy photograph 0 0.0   308 96.8 Table 2: Google searches (combined)        In the media searches, the feature articles examined using the search terms \\u201cclimate change\\u201d and \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d discussed various issues, including the appointment of a new Federal Environment Minister, and the recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Cancun, Mexico (November 29 \\u2013 December 10, 2010). Some articles did use specific photographs linked to this content, but other articles were illustrated with more generic images of smokestacks or extreme weather.  61      Of the fourteen articles examined from The Globe and Mail, three contained images of smokestacks or air pollution, and three showed images from the Cancun summit. Two showed photographs of a specific person profiled in the article (i.e. political figure), and two articles showed images of extreme weather (i.e. snowstorms, flooding, etc.). Two articles showed other natural phenomenon linked to information presented in the feature article (i.e. algae on a lake in Saskatchewan). There was one image of refugees displaced by climate change impacts.       While The New York Times does use the term \\u201cGlobal Warming\\u201d in their coverage, a search using the term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d also generated sufficient articles to ensure comparisons with The Globe and Mail and the Guardian. As in The Globe and Mail coverage, only photographs were presented associated with the feature articles. These photographs, as with The Globe and Mail, appeared to be selected to refer specifically to the topic of the article, and there were no examples of generalized iconic illustrations of \\u201cburning Earth\\u201d.      Of these selected articles in The New York Times articles, there was only one image of smokestacks or air pollution, compared with three images in The Globe and Mail survey. In The New York Times articles, three included images of a profiled person (i.e. political figure), and three showed images of other natural phenomenon that were linked specifically to the article. Two of the images showed evidence of extreme weather (i.e. snowstorms on the East Coast), and two articles showed examples of alternative energy (i.e. wind power turbines). Again, in comparison with the Google searches, there were few images of polar ice, glaciers, and polar animals, with only one image featured of each.  62      As with The Globe and Mail and The New York Times survey, the fourteen feature articles selected from the Guardian website were chosen using the search terms \\u201cclimate change\\u201d and \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d (seven articles from each term). Like the other outlets, each feature article used only photographs to illustrate these articles, and the photograph was placed on the left hand side of the page, near the first paragraph.      In the Guardian articles, photographs of smokestacks and air pollution were more commonly used than in The Globe and Mail and The New York Times articles, accounting for six of the fourteen articles examined. As well, there were three pictures of alternative energy sources (i.e. windfarms or solar panels), and two photographs of extreme weather. As with The Globe and Mail and The New York Times articles, there were no generalized images associated with \\u201cfire\\u201d or \\u201cice\\u201d motifs.      After examining all three media sources, it is evident that there is a distinct break from the imagery evident in the Google search. In contrast with the images generated by Google and sourced from media outlets, news aggregators, and various blogs, these media sites used photographs almost exclusively to complement their text content, and generally did not use graphic images with layering or illustrative elements. There were no images using the \\u201cburning Earth\\u201d motif, or any other type of play on the term \\u201cglobal warming\\u201d. In the articles examined, there were also no cartoons evident. All the images in the media coverage examined were \\u201cnews\\u201d photographs, presented without additional elements, colours, or overlaid text.      As well, instead of the vague, conceptual illustrations of \\u201cfire\\u201d and \\u201cice\\u201d found in the Google searches, the feature articles from the three media sites predominantly tried to use photographs that related directly to the subject matter. Beyond The New York Times polar  63 bear icon, few of the iconic \\u201cfire and ice\\u201d images evident in the Google searches were used (see Table 3).

As discussed above, the website of each of these organizations profiled varies widely, according to scope, mandate, design, and audience.      Despite these differences, the organizations\\u2019 websites used imagery that closely paralleled the photographs and illustrations found in the media and Google searches. Photographs of ice  64 (glaciers, polar ice and icebergs), for example, were the most common type of image on these websites, accounting for 17.8% of the images examined. Images of extreme weather events, alternative energy projects, and smokestacks were also used extensively. Images of the globe were also evident, although there were few of the \\u201cburning Earth\\u201d illustrations displayed.       One key difference with this search was the placement of images of environmental activism and protest campaigns. These images, accounting for 8.1% of the total, were found primarily on the Greenpeace site, which has a long history of documenting and publicizing their activist campaigns (Dale 1996) (see Table 4).

Images of ice, snow and polar animals are slightly more common, accounting for 21% of the total images. Taken as separate categories, photographs of ice (including glaciers, icebergs and polar regions) are the second-most common category, with 13.2% of the total images.       Images of the globe were also common, either with or without the \\u201cfire\\u201d motif. Images of the globe without fire elements were the third most popular category, accounting for 10.3% of the images, while the two categories combined equaled 19.6% of the total images.       Photographs of smokestacks and air pollution were the fourth-most popular category, accounting for 9.7% of the images (see Table 5).              66 GOOGLE SEARCHES, MEDIA & ORGANIZATION RESULTS   TOTAL % Cartoon or other image photo / illus. 65 13.4 Ice  photograph 64 13.2 Globe photo / illus. 50 10.3 Smokestacks / air pollution photograph 47 9.7 Globe (fire/heat) illustration 45 9.3 Graph or chart illustration 35 7.2 Ice & polar animals photograph 25 5.2 Fire / heat illustration 22 4.5 Alternative energy photograph 21 4.3 Extreme weather photograph 19 3.9 Other natural phenomenon photograph 18 3.7 Environmental activism / protests photograph 12 2.5 Climate summit (i.e. Cancun, UN, etc.) photograph 11 2.3 Flooding illustration 11 2.3 Environmental pollution /destruction photograph 9 1.9 Profiled person (political figure, etc.) photograph 8 1.6 Polar animals  illustration 6 1.2 Displaced community / refugees photograph 5 1.0 Ice / snow illustration 4 0.8 Extreme weather / ice combo photo / illus. 4 0.8 Fire / ice combo illustration 3 0.6 Globe (flooding) photo / illus. 1 0.2   485 100.0 Table 5: Google, media, and NGO results (combined)        While the scope of this research is limited, it is evident that the websites surveyed do continue to utilize certain types of content to illustrate coverage of climate change issues. Images of burning planets, icy landscapes, and forlorn polar bears, continually re-circulating in a variety of online venues and formats, repeats specific narratives about fragile landscapes, pristine natural environments, and the uneasy role humans play in the natural world.      This study also reveals the strong emergence of other images, particularly the photographs of smokestacks and extreme weather conditions. With the numerous natural disasters and extreme weather episodes that have occurred in recent years, photographs of flooding, snowfalls, or hurricanes tend to relate to current events in specific locations. In an interview  67 conducted for this project, a media editor noted that using these photographs brought climate change issues \\u201ccloser to home\\u201d, enabling greater sympathy for audiences (Smith and Joffe 2009).      The images of smokestacks are particularly intriguing, since they were evident in both the media and organizations\\u2019 websites. Rarely identified as linked to a specific industry or location, there is no clear notation describing the type of emission or what (if anything) is actually burning or being released. Without labels or context, these photographs of smokestacks are menacing, but it is unclear what the nature of the threat is.      As an icon of modernity and industrial production, the smokestack image reinforces the endangerment of contemporary risk in our society (Beck 1992, Spiegel 2001, 16). There have been enough of these images used to provide a conceptual link between the images of smokestacks and the concept of greenhouse gas emissions. A quick Google image search using the terms \\u201cgreenhouse gas\\u201d reveals many pages of smokestack photographs. Al Gore\\u2019s film An Inconvenient Truth, for example, used an illustration of smokestacks for their poster and promotional campaign.          68 3    Chapter: CONCLUSION  3.1 The empty mirror       Scrapbooks function traditionally as an empty repository for images and objects linked to personal experience, with a one-way trajectory from blank page to scribbled, layered catalogue of memory and nostalgia. Attempting to collect online images of climate change does not follow a parallel path, however, as re-cycled photographs and illustrations circulate endlessly, providing little traction for engagement or understanding. Empty of context, these images reflect what the viewer projects (Bolter 2003, 20, Burnett 2004, 205).       This may be due to the surprising lack of contextual resonance found in many of these images, particularly those photographs and illustrations of de-populated or isolated landscapes. From the icy plains of the polar regions to the detached, suspended illustrations of planet Earth, these images seem to have been scoured of any reference to human activity or agency.      It is perhaps more than mere irony that these images, apparently divorced from human content, have come to be linked to one of the most challenging environmental and political issues of our age. The phenomenon of climate change emerged initially from the journals of scientific research and has been largely defined within the boundaries of scientific discussion. The images that have been associated with climate change content have, in an odd way, also fallen into this rubric of impartiality and objectivity. Unsullied by the \\u201chand at work in the human fabric of science\\u201d, these de-personalized images uphold the \\u201csanctity of objectivity\\u201d (Latour 2002, 18). While not necessarily containing references to scientific research, these images have been placed in conjunction with scientific findings so frequently  69 that they appear to be impartial as well. In Gore\\u2019s companion book, An Inconvenient Truth, for example, photographs of melting glaciers and planet Earth recur frequently next to graphs and charts describing various elements of climate research, imparting the photographs and illustrations the same \\u201cimpartiality\\u201d given to the other illustrations (Gore 2006).      In an odd double blind, however, these images are linked to an issue that inspires deep passions, inspiring almost-evangelical displays of devotion or dismissal. As a \\u201cplastic\\u201d phenomenon, climate change exposes \\u201cboth our individual selves and our collective societies\\u201d (Hulme 2009b, 357). Emptied of meaning, these images act like \\u201cuntroubled mirror[s]\\u201d reflecting our own images back to ourselves (Foucault 1994, 27).      Functioning as blank mirrors, climate change images can arguably be utilized as a type of rhetoric. Traditionally, propaganda studies have examined the efforts of various interests to influence or sway public opinion towards a particular cause or idea. While the use of climate change images does not tidily fall into such an analysis, there are elements of this scholarship that can provide insight into the use of these photographs or illustrations.      Images, like text, can be useful tools of rhetorical persuasion, and many scholars have examined the particular significance of visual imagery in political propaganda (Jowett and O\\u2019Donnell 1999, Corner and Richardson 1993). Invoking emotion, visual images can be \\u201cpowerful political tools, engaging people\\u2019s attention\\u201d, and ultimately changing our beliefs (Perlmutter 2003, 2, Deluca 1999).       But can images of climate change be seen purely as persuasive devices? Many of the images described in this thesis can be associated with messages about risk. Images of melting glaciers and cracking ice floes, for example, can symbolize a \\u201cbeautiful devastation\\u201d, creating a sense of shock when viewers understand that this landscape is endangered (Doyle  70 2007, 132). Photographs illustrating climate change content can be classified as potent symbols of \\u201ccollective danger and individual vulnerability\\u201d to viewers and audiences (Manzo 2010, 97).      While environmental risk communication is a well-developed field of scholarship, there are few, if any, examinations of visual images associated with risk communications, like the images of smokestacks and melting glaciers evident in this study (Remillard 2011, 129). Visual images, even more than text, can create new cognitive associations and potentially strengthen the impact of risk messages (Smith 2005). As a result, the importance of visual imagery should not be discounted when discussing public discourse concerning climate change.      As some scholars have noted, the inclusion of text or visual elements that induce fear in an audience has often been utilized both in mass media coverage and environmental campaign literature. Alarmist, inflammatory language and imagery have often been utilized in order to create a sense of drama, draw attention, and inspire action from the public (Cox 2006, Doyle 2007, O\\u2019Neill and Nicolson-Cole 2009).      One survey of U.K. media coverage, for example, noted that media outlets consistently used inflammatory language in their coverage of the release of the IPCC 2007 report. Although each of these newspapers appeal to various demographics, nine of the ten outlets surveyed presented a uniform message of  \\u201crising anxiety\\u201d, using adjectives like \\u201cshocking\\u201d, \\u201cterrifying\\u201d, or \\u201cdevastating\\u201d in their articles. As well, words like \\u201cfinal\\u201d, \\u201cfears\\u201d, and \\u201cdisaster\\u201d in the headlines, all terms that were not used in either the IPCC report or corresponding public presentations by the IPCC in Paris (Hulme 2007). Other critics warn that the publicizing of climate research, through the efforts of organizations like the IPCC  71 and individual works like An Inconvenient Truth, often incorporates a level of \\u201cemotionalizing\\u201d that may be prove to deter rational debate (Buse 2007).      Interestingly, a corresponding online search of leading newspapers in the United States for the same time period showed headlines that were much more measured in tone, suggesting a \\u201cmore neutral\\u201d representation of the IPCC\\u2019s key message in the U.S. In a letter to the British science journal Nature, researcher Mike Hulme argued that the tone of coverage in the U.K. was appealing to fear in order to generate a sense of urgency, but was ultimately misguided, as such appeals \\u201coften lead to denial, paralysis [or] apathy\\u201d (Hulme 2007).      Others scholars concur with this assessment, and studies on hazards and risks have determined that detailed, accurate information is not enough to influence public concern about specific issues. While access to factual information is important, people are also largely affected by emotional concerns, of which images play an important role  (Lorenzoni 2006, Smith 2009).       There is a lack of consensus about the efficacy of using strong, powerful appeals in order to sway public opinion. It is understandable that a tone of urgency has been utilized in the development of rhetoric concerning climate change issues, partly because this type of terminology and framework has been a component of environmental activist campaigns for many years (Dale 1996). Some argue that this type of rhetoric is necessary in order to draw attention to important issues, and underline the critical nature of the cause (Hulme 2009b, 233).      But does this type of tactic produce effective social change? Two studies were conducted in the U.K. to determine the influence of visual and iconic representations of climate change, and concluded that images designed to appeal to a viewer\\u2019s sense of fear may be assumed to  72 be more memorable and attract greater attention.  However, iconic images like melting glaciers, cracking polar ice caps, and extreme weather scenes \\u201ccan also act to distance and disempower individuals\\u201d, effectively disabling a sense of personal engagement with the issue (O\\u2019Neill and Nicolson-Cole 2009, 374-5).  3.2 A patchwork narrative       While many may not necessarily concur on the proper tactics needed to address climate change, it would not be hard to agree that the results from over twenty years of \\u201cscience, economics, international relations, diplomacy and politics\\u201d have not yielded comprehensive, satisfactory solutions to the problem (Hulme 2009b). The awkward, stilted circulation of images illustrating climate change content emphasizes the scope of this problem. Our current visual imagination seems to be stuck on an \\u201ceither/or\\u201d groove, cycling through a predictable mix of smokestacks or polar bears, burning planets or melting glaciers.      Used repeatedly, images have been blamed for causing complacency or \\u201cnumbness\\u201d in audiences weary of visual stimulation (Green, Mann and Story 2006). While generating complacency may not be the goal of campaigners or web editors, it may be useful to acknowledge that the repetition of climate change images may partly hinge on their iconic status. It may be easier to illustrate the new and often confusing articles, research and reports generated about climate change with images that are easy to comprehend.      Should these images of melting glaciers and polar bears on thin ice be discarded completely? American photojournalist Gary Braasch, for example, has spent a decade documenting the effects of climate change around the world, and many of his published images depict smokestacks, floods, and melting ice (Braasch 2007). These images may  73 contain overused content, but others would argue that accurate, vivid photo-documentation is useful, inspiring greater awareness with its \\u201csobering\\u201d message (Ward 2007).      However, by narrowing our collective gaze solely on the images of risk and impact, we may have impaired our ability to understand and address the issue of climate change more carefully. There seems to be a deeper reluctance to acknowledge the complexities of our understanding of climate as a cultural construct, and an absence of discussion about how we have used the context of climate in various ways over many centuries. Just like the natural world, our climate has been the subject of both benign indifference and imperialistic attempts at dominance, identified at times as fragile and pristine, or dangerous and chaotic (Hulme 2009b, 22-7).      Some may argue that all we need to re-invigorate our visual language regarding climate change is a fresh aesthetic perspective, using the creative talents of artists to develop \\u201cfresh understandings\\u201d of environmental issues (Ridgeway 2009). In 2006, for example, the Cape Farewell project brought visual artists and writers to the Arctic to create new types of creative engagement with current scientific research and the northern landscape, resulting in educational exhibitions and publications (Buckland 2006).      While projects like Cape Farewell offer an interesting step in a new direction, I think there are still echoes of old dialogues emerging in art projects like this. There is certainly value to the collaborative nature and collective discussion of these events, but projects like Cape Farewell still seem to navigate in a familiar landscape, where climate change is defined as occurring in remote realms within a context of nostalgia for lost or altered natural ecosystems (Jasanoff 2005, Doyle 2007, Remillard 2011).  74      Even if art projects can develop new visual strategies for engagement and representation with climate issues, these images will likely not crossover successfully into journalistic frameworks, which operate using different sets of criteria for images and illustrations. While presenting overused, generic illustrations may be a losing strategy for media outlets and other types of organizations, I\\u2019m uncertain how new forms of visual representation can be utilized or created for this type of content.      Perhaps our visual language concerning climate change may eventually become more hybridized, reflecting not only our increasingly \\u201chuman weather\\u201d climate (Hulme 2009a), but also the user-oriented, participatory tone of many visual experiments in the digital realm. Optimally, we could apply the \\u201cre-mix\\u201d spirit of digital engagement to climate change, with greater encouragement of messy, personalized responses to the issue.      Certainly, contemporary discourse could benefit from some questioning of the deeper narratives attached to our understanding of climate change. Our presentation of climate change content currently appears to be in lock-step, rigidly linked to scientific research and public policy that is \\u201cstrip[ped]\\u2026of cultural anchors and ideological meanings\\u201d (Hulme 2009b, 355).       Perhaps it is time to develop new narratives, conceding that our focus has been restrained by our efforts to remain impartial and sustain public urgency. In examining an overlooked area of research, I\\u2019ve attempted to create a type of \\u201cpatchwork\\u201d narrative, in an effort to contribute to more complex, nuanced discussions of climate change. Developing a cross- disciplinary, \\u201cbricolage\\u201d approach to this research may offer new insights and opportunities (Benjamin 2002, Sontag 2001). After decades of discourse moderated by objective perspectives and detached observation, it may be valuable to incorporate more unorthodox  75 methods into the mix, in order to comprehend how our understandings of climate change are framed, shaped, and presented.  76 BIBLIOGRAPHY  Adam, David. 2007. \\u201cWorld poised to sign climate deal.\\u201d The Guardian.

More specifically, it examines the accuracy, fairness, and completeness of US news coverage through a detailed qualitative and quantitative content analysis of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.  This study is important at this time, as it coincides with a defining moment in US history \\u2013 the introduction (and implementation) of health policy change.  In 2008, close to forty six million people in the United States lacked any form of health insurance and medical bills were the second major cause of personal bankruptcy (Marmor, \\u201cAmerican Health Care Policy and Politics\\u201d 4).  The following year, during President Barack Obama\\u201fs first year in office, healthcare reform was placed near the top of the domestic policy agenda and, after a year of bipartisan debate, new health legislation was introduced in the first quarter of 2010.  The $940- billion law marked the beginning of some potentially positive changes to healthcare insurance policy, bringing America close to universal health coverage for the first time in its history.  But such change did not come without resistance, and ultimately, compromise.  The new law, which places insurance companies under stricter moral obligation and offers greater insurance affordability and coverage for the nation\\u201fs poorest, did not receive a single vote in favour from the Republican Party.  Ultimately, the legislation represents only a fraction of the changes Obama hoped to bring about to healthcare in America.  Opposition to healthcare reform in America is nothing new.  In 1993, L.R. Jacobs recognized that the mixture of government \\u201csupport and dread [was] the defining characteristic 2  of American public opinion toward health reform\\u201d (634).  Prior failed healthcare initiatives include Theodore Roosevelt\\u201fs national plan in the early 1900s, Harry Truman\\u201fs public health insurance proposal in the 1950s, and, more recently, Bill Clinton\\u201fs Health Security initiative at the close of the 20 th  century.  The polarization of Democrats and Republicans over the passage of healthcare legislation in 2010 suggests America\\u201fs anxiety and uncertainly over the government\\u201fs role in healthcare continues to play an important role in policy decision-making.  Much of the debate over healthcare reform was carried out in the mainstream media.  In fact, a study conducted by the Pew Research Center\\u201fs Project for Excellence in Journalism reveals that \\u201cin the 10-month period from June 2009 through March 2010, the health care debate was the leading subject in the mainstream [US] news media\\u201d, putting it ahead of the economy and well ahead of the war in Afghanistan (\\u201cSix Things to Know About Health Care Coverage\\u201d). The study\\u201fs authors further note America\\u201fs mainstream media \\u201cseemed to focus far more on the politics and passions that drove the debate than the health care system it was trying to reform\\u201d (n.pag).  In order to gauge the role that traditional journalism platforms (specifically newspapers) played in the healthcare debate, this thesis sought to determine the fairness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of American coverage of healthcare beyond the US border.  More specifically, it sought characterize how US newspapers represented Canadian Medicare and the United Kingdom\\u201fs NHS, which have frequently served as foils to America\\u201fs largely private insurance-based healthcare system.  This study both replicates and builds on Pauline M. Vaillancourt Rosenau\\u201fs seminal study, \\u201cUS Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian health System \\u2013 A Case of Seriously Mistaken Identity\\u201d (2006), which explored coverage of Canadian Medicare in the New York Times and 3  Wall Street Journal between 2000 and mid-June of 2005.  Rosenau\\u201fs methods for data selection and coding were adopted in order to test the study\\u201fs protocols and try to extrapolate change between periods of study.  Consistent with Rosenau\\u201fs work, the present study relies largely on quantitative analysis, focusing specifically on the presence of coverage themes and various reporting dimensions to measure accuracy and fairness.  Key differences from Rosenau\\u201fs study include a briefer sample period (two and a quarter versus five years), expanded scope (encompassing both Medicare and NHS) and an increase in the number of sources (with the addition of coverage from USA Today).  This thesis has three main objectives: 1) to provide a reliable benchmark for comparing the quality of pre- and intra-reform US coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system, 2) to assess American print media coverage of the NHS, and 3) to illustrate the overall impact of shifting healthcare policy on US print coverage of external, publically-funded healthcare systems, such as Medicare and the NHS.  The first section of this paper presents a review of the literature, followed by a summary of hypotheses and the methodological approach that was employed.  The next sections offer the results of the study and a thorough discussion of coverage trends. In closing, the study\\u201fs limitations, particularly the methodological shortfalls, are outlined and suggestions for further research are provided. 4   2 Literature Review  This section begins by establishing the theoretical framework behind the role of media as it pertains to this study.  The main purpose of this literature review, however, is to illustrate what the existing body of literature reveals about American media coverage of healthcare in Canada and the United Kingdom. 1   In order to properly gauge the significance of such analyses, research that addressed America\\u201fs coverage of the US healthcare system was also examined.  The final part of the literature review touches on the vast and growing body of research that explores cross-cultural perspectives on healthcare policy.  This field of research illustrates the combined value, yet inherent difficulty of comparative healthcare studies, and emphasizes the increased difficulty of cross-cultural healthcare reporting, particularly during times of policy change, when both stakes and emotions run high. 2.1  Understanding the Role of the Media: Entman on News Framing  A common theory, known as the agenda setting effect, contends that \\u201cthe news sets the public opinion agenda, bringing some issues to the forefront and minimizing others\\u201d (Krippendorff and Bock 205).  Under this view, \\u201cmedia content doesn\\u201ft so much tell the audience what to think as it tells the audience what to think about\\u201d (205).  Related to this theory is the notion of framing, which involves media selection or emphasis of certain aspects or features of an issue (Entman 52).  Robert M. Entman\\u201fs approach to news framing and the power of the media served as the guiding theoretical framework for this thesis.  Entman defines framing  1  Journal articles considered for this literature review were taken from the following three databases:  Academic Search Complete, Medline, and Communication and Mass Media Complete. Articles were selected using a combination of the following search terms: Canada, Canadian, Medicare, UK, United Kingdom, Great Britain, NHS, America*, United States, health care reform, healthcare, newspaper coverage, and media representation.  5  as the selection and emphasis of \\u201csome aspects of a perceived reality\\u201d in a communicating text (52).  Frames, according to Entman, are manifested by the presence or complete absence of \\u201ckey words, stock phrases, stereotyped images, sources of information, and sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or judgements\\u201d, which channel, or guide thinking (52). In other words, \\u201cframes select and call attention to particular aspects of the reality described, which logically means that frames simultaneously direct attention away from other aspects\\u201d (54).   In agreement, Rosenau suggests that \\u201cthe details journalist\\u201fs select for their articles subtly construct reality and thereby influence readers\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 28).  With respect to American newspaper coverage of foreign healthcare systems, Rosenau argues that \\u201cthere is evidence that newspapers shape citizens\\u201f perception and opinions by cueing the coverage\\u201d (27).  Consequently, she maintains, there is good reason to believe that Canada\\u201fs national image on the global stage is influenced, to some extent, by the media (27).  The same speculation could arguably be applied to American newspaper coverage of the UK.  Entman\\u201fs position on the relationship between news framing and journalistic objectivity is of particular interest to this study.   According to Entman, the formulaic norm of journalistic objectivity does not guarantee balanced reporting.  Instead, he states, journalists \\u201cfrequently allow the most skilful media manipulators to impose their dominant frames on the news\\u201d which subsequently leads to reporting that \\u201cprevents most audience members from making a balanced assessment of a situation\\u201d (56).  For the purposes of this analysis, the media was understood to be both knowingly and, more often, unintentionally influenced by external forces, particularly politicians and special interest groups.  As a result, it was anticipated that the viewpoints and stories of \\u201emedia manipulators\\u201f would be highlighted in US news coverage and lead to the 6  dominance of particular news frames (and coverage themes) in American reporting of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems. 2.2 American Media Representation of Canada\\u2019s Healthcare System   Over the past decade, there have been several key academic studies on American media coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system: Pauline M. Vaillancourt Rosenau\\u201fs \\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System \\u2013 A Case of Seriously Mistaken Identity?\\u201d 2006; Christopher M. Belch\\u201fs \\u201cA View from Abroad: An Analysis of Canadian Coverage in U.S. Newspapers\\u201d 2004; and Theodore R. Marmor\\u201fs \\u201cFact and Fiction: The Medicare \\u201eCrisis\\u201f Seen From the US\\u201d 2000.  These scholars focused on several areas of study, including the limited nature of US coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system, the quality of reporting (accuracy, completeness, balance, and tone), and the representation of key themes, such as wait times.  They approached areas of research using different methodologies, varying from qualitative and quantitative content analysis through to an isolated case study.  The diversity of their findings reflects the methodological approach as well as period differences and the application of different theoretical frameworks.  Rosenau\\u201fs study, a content analysis of five and a half years of newspaper coverage of thirty-eight articles from the New York Times and twelve from the Wall Street Journal, provides the greatest insight into American print media coverage of Canadian healthcare to date. Her aim was to determine the fairness, accuracy, and completeness of US coverage.  Overall, she found substantial gaps in knowledge, which led her to conclude that \\u201cUS newspaper reporting on the topic of the Canadian health system in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal is poor\\u201d, and that \\u201cthe complex reality of the Canadian health system would be better understood in the U.S. if coverage were fairer, more accurate, more complete, and not so often a source of 7  confusion, oversimplification, omission, and error\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 44-45).  Rosenau found that coverage relied heavily on anecdotal information and tended to over- simplify variation between the provincially administered healthcare systems, particularly with respect to coverage of Quebec (a province neglected almost entirely by the NYT and WSJ over the study period of half a decade).  She further noted that reporters often focused on controversial issues or ongoing healthcare themes, such as emergency wait times or doctor shortages.  Such discretionary news coverage, she argued, \\u201creinforces preconceived, often mistaken ideas about the Canadian health system and does little to correct commonly held misconceptions\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 44).  In concert, Rosenau believes that these shortfalls and inaccuracies logically contribute to confusion and argued that \\u201cnewspaper coverage may be misleading the U.S. public as well as policy-makers\\u201d (46).  While Rosenau\\u201fs study added substantially to the knowledge base in this area, it also had a number of inherent limitations that were acknowledged by the author.  Firstly, the study was limited to only two (granted major) national newspapers.  Her conclusions, therefore, cannot be extrapolated with confidence to other newspapers or locations and therefore do not fully satisfy the study\\u201fs objective to assess the perceptions of US citizens (as a whole).  Furthermore, Rosenau presents no evidence as to whether US newspaper coverage is better or worse than domestic (Canadian) coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system.  And, finally, the study did not examine how US newspapers cover the US health system as a point for comparison.  The inadequacy of coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system was also noted by Christopher Belch, who conducted a topical analysis of American print coverage of Canadian 8  news in four state newspapers (The Detroit News, The Dallas Morning News, The San Francisco Chronicle, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch) and one national American newspaper (the New York Times) over a two-month period in 2004. Belch noted that \\u201cthe underlying ethos of American media exposure to Canada seem[ed] to be through sports, particularly hockey and auto racing\\u201d (43).  In the New York Times, for example, healthcare articles accounted for less than ten per cent of overall coverage (83).  Yet, though coverage of healthcare north of the border was found to be narrow, Belch concluded that the Canadian healthcare system was positively depicted and framed to suggest similarities between the US and Canada (71).  In contrast, Ted Marmor found that various publications, including the New York Times, tended to highlight differences between healthcare in America and Canada, often presenting the Canadian system in a negative light.  However, it is important to note that Marmor\\u201fs conclusions are limited, as they stem from a single case study, which exclusively analyzed US media coverage of North American emergency room overcrowding during the seasonal flu outbreak of December 1999 through to February 2000.  During this outbreak, Marmor discovered that US reporters tended to portray Canadian healthcare as \\u201ca program in deep trouble, overcome by problems of access, cost, and quality\\u201d (\\u201cFact and Fiction\\u201d 1).  Such representations, he asserts, conflict with data and analysis offered by independent, not-for-profit organizations, like the Canadian Institute for Health Information (1). In reflecting on the larger media scene, Marmor argues that US \\u201cjournalistic interest in Canadian Medicare reflects the place of health insurance issues on the national agenda\\u201d (\\u201cFact and Fiction\\u201d 2).  As such, \\u201cattention is intermittent, not very well informed and mostly [a] reflect[ion] [of] the preoccupations of American interest groups\\u201d, whom, he notes, bring stories and documentation  to the press (2-3).  In conclusion, Marmor points out that \\u201cthe media\\u201fs 9  commitment to even-handedness actually undermines a balanced view of Medicare\\u201d and argues that \\u201cas long as stories are the mechanism for understanding Medicare, distortion of the program\\u201fs strengths and weaknesses will continue\\u201d (3).  Such an analysis, though helpful on a national level, is somewhat limited by its approach to media as a single entity, without regional and political variation. 2.3 American Media Representation of the United Kingdom\\u2019s Healthcare System   A search of the literature revealed that academic endeavours relating to American media\\u201fs coverage of the UK\\u201fs healthcare system are underdeveloped.  While there has been little in the way of academic interest, casual observation of American television news programming and newspaper editorials suggests that unsubstantiated claims about the NHS have circulated in US news in recent years.  As a case in point, in 2007, Fox News dedicated a segment to the contentious proposition that universal healthcare in the UK acts as a breeding ground for terror. Together, program host Neil Cavuto and guest Jerry Bowyer alleged that the bureaucratic nature of state run health care invites terror (Bennet).  The segment, in which Bowyer proposed that doctor shortages in the UK have paved the way for increased physician recruitment from Muslim nations, juxtaposed images of explosives and car bombs with patients receiving MRIs, an ironic comment on Fox\\u2019s commitment to their trademarked slogan: fair and balanced (Your World).  With the onset of Obama\\u201fs push for reforming healthcare insurance coverage in the US, the debate over state-run healthcare remerged in public view, and myths about the NHS circulated in American news coverage once more.  While the existence of widespread inaccuracy in news coverage of the NHS cannot yet be confirmed by academic reports, observations by UK journalists reveal that misrepresentation of the NHS did occur during this timeframe.  In August, 10  2009, for example, journalist Raphael Satter of HuffPost Social News wrote that criticism of the NHS \\u201cstung Britain\\u201fs left-leaning Labour government\\u201d so hard that the \\u201cDepartment of Health took the unusual step of contacting The Associated Press\\u201d to rebut \\u201cwhat it said were misconceptions about the NHS being bandied about in the U.S. media\\u201d (n.pag).  In summary, this literature review reveals that more formal studies are required to determine the true nature of US coverage of the NHS, and whether reporting inaccuracies pervade outside of narrow observation of selected news reports \\u2013 an objective of this particular study. 2.4 American Media Representation of US Healthcare  A number of scholars (Limor Peer et. al, Trudy Lieberman, Gary Schwitzer, and Melinda Voss) have studied healthcare reportage in the United States over the last decade.  A main finding of their studies relates to the overall nature and changing quality of healthcare coverage in the US in recent years, and suggests a general bias towards influence of external factors, such as the economy and industry demands, on reporting scope and complexity (Schwitzer 11). Limor Peer et al. argue that the broad category of health/fitness/medicine receives limited coverage in American newspapers.  In \\u201cThe daily diet of news: Variation in newspaper content\\u201d (2000), the authors examined the average allocation of news content (quantified by story space) devoted to particular topics, and explored how market characteristics (such as circulation, competition, ownership, and literacy) impact categorical emphasis (5).  The authors determined, through the categorization of a week of content from 101 daily newspapers, that the combined topic of health/fitness/medicine represented just over three per cent of all story space in newspapers (18).  The market characteristic that had a significant impact on space devoted to this particular category was region, with the northeast and Midwest regions of the US devoting the most relative space, followed by the west and south (13).  In contrast, nearly a quarter of all story 11  space was devoted to sports, followed by politics/government at eighteen per cent and business and crime at eight per cent each (18).  With specific reference to healthcare journalism, Trudy Lieberman argues that \\u201cthere are plenty of good, hardworking reporters on the healthcare beat\\u201d in America, but affirms that there are too many cases where the media actively undermine trust in healthcare (\\u201cTrustworthy Information: The Role of the Media\\u201d 115).  The deterioration of US trust in healthcare fostered by the media happens, she says, \\u201cin identifiable ways and for understandable, if not laudable, reasons\\u201d, with industry norms and pressures influencing the ability of journalists to accurately report health and healthcare news (115).  Together with the time-sensitive nature of news, Lieberman cites journalism culture \\u2013 the way journalists are trained to look at and write about particular issues \\u2013 as another factor that leads to inaccurate and unreliable examples of healthcare reporting (115-117).  In an effort to demonstrate her claim, Lieberman refers to a study that she conducted in 2002, where she examined 127 articles from major US newspapers, exploring the congressional debate over adding a prescription drug benefit to America\\u201fs Medicare program. Lieberman discovered that the vast majority of articles focused on the political angle: \\u201cReporters piled quote upon quote from Democrats, Republicans, the Speaker of the House, and the leaders of the Senate and offered various prognostications about which political party would benefit more, if the drug bill were passed or if it were killed\\u201d (117).  Only a few articles, she states, examined the human angle, looking at how the bill would have impacted the people it was intended for (117).  In summary, Lieberman believes that as a result of standard journalism practice, some US media outlets \\u201cfail to provide readers or viewers with the accurate information they need\\u201d, or provide \\u201ctoo much information that is misleading, unreliable, or simply useless\\u201d (115). 12   HealthNewsReview.org, launched in 2006 and led by Gary Schwitzer, provides greater insight into the overall quality of health journalism in America today.  Using a standardized rating system, reviewers from the fields of journalism, medicine, health services research and public health asses the accuracy, balance, and completeness of online health stories from a wide range of news outlets, including the NY Times, WSJ, and USA Today. 2   The site is largely critical of health stories on medical treatments, tests, products, and procedures, illustrating that the quality of health journalism in the US stands to be improved.  Factors, particularly journalistic and economic, influence the ability of journalists to report health and healthcare news.  Melinda Voss\\u201fs 2002 study \\u201cChecking the Pulse\\u201d, which examined self-perceived reporting ability among health journalists in five Midwestern states, stands as evidence that inadequate training of healthcare reporters may negatively impact the state of healthcare journalism in the US.  A large number of respondents in Voss\\u201fs study found that understanding key health issues, putting health news in context, producing balanced stories on deadline, and interpreting statistics was \\u201csometimes to nearly always difficult\\u201d (1159).  Such concerns, Voss suggests, stem from inadequate training, pointing to the fact that nearly 83 per cent of respondents reported having received no training for covering health news (1158).  In 2009, the Kaiser Family Foundation, a US-based private non-profit organization that focuses on matters related to American healthcare, issued a report exploring the state of health journalism in the US, focusing specifically on how recent changes in American newsrooms are affecting coverage.  It noted that in the last three years, cuts in budget and staff have led to  2  HealthNewsReview.org examines daily online news stories from: USA Today, Wall Street Journal, NY Times, LA Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Houston Chronicle, Arizona Republic, Denver Post, and the Dallas Morning News. Also checked daily: National Public Radio health & science page, Reader's Digest.com health news page, MSNBC.com health news section, CNN.com health news section, WebMD health news section. Checked weekly: websites of news magazines Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report. 13  several troubling trends in US health journalism, including 1) \\u201cAn emphasis on stories that can be produced quickly \\u2013 often meaning more stories on medical studies, and sometimes sacrificing on quality\\u201d; 2) \\u201cFewer in-depth or complex stories, especially about health policy, and more \\u201ehyper local\\u201f stories along with stories variously described as lifestyle, consumer, or news-you- can-use\\u201d; 3) \\u201cReliance on stories produced and syndicated elsewhere, by non-traditional news sources\\u201d; 4) \\u201cThe influence of commercial interest on health news\\u201d (Schwitzer 9).  The study also found that the topic of health policy receives far less coverage than other stories related to health, noting that out of all journalism platforms, the traditional (and declining) platform of newspaper provides the greatest coverage of health policy (11). 2.5 The Value of Cross-National Health Policy Research in Media Reporting  As Ted Marmor has noted, \\u201ctimes of policy change increase the demand for new ideas \\u2013 or at least new means to old ends\\u201d (\\u201cComparative Perspectives and Policy Learning in the World of Health Care\\u201d 4).  In the late 1980s and early 90s there was increased academic, media, and public interest in America in examples of successful healthcare reform in other nations, particularly Canada (Hamburger et al. 5).  With this interest emerged extensive commentary that may have inhibited accurate assessment and understanding of foreign healthcare at large.  A study conducted by Christopher Potter and Janet Porter, which explored the perpetuation of stereotypes and myths of UK\\u201fs healthcare system in American culture, enforces this view.  In \\u201cAmerican Perceptions of the British National Health Service: Five Myths\\u201d (1989), Potter and Porter examined five myths thought to be commonly held by Americans about the British National Health Service.  Each myth, chosen on the basis of discussions with students, health service professionals, academics, and citizens during Potter\\u201fs two-year placement as a visiting scholar at the University of 14  Minnesota, was evaluated to determine its factual accuracy.  With reference to health service research and policy reports, the authors evaluated the truthfulness of whether: 1) healthcare care in the UK is a form of socialized medicine, 2) widespread rationing occurs, 3) patients have long wait times, 4) there is no free choice of healthcare providers, and 5) private medicine is taking over (342).  They concluded that ethnocentricity and cultural biases have led to America\\u201fs misgivings about the NHS and the perpetuation of stereotypes that serve to discredit the British system (364).  Ultimately, they suggest that the five myths \\u201climit the ability of Americans to objectively evaluate the NHS and prevent them from learning about the British system\\u201d (341).  It has been noted that despite the growth of US health policy research into cross-national comparisons and the potential for improved coverage of foreign healthcare and greater public awareness during the early 1990s, some journalists failed to explain how lessons from abroad could be adapted to the US system and struggled to illustrate the sheer complexity of foreign healthcare systems (Cano 157).  In reflection, Carlos Cano states that the Canadian model of national health insurance \\u201ccould not possibly [have] be[en] accurately understood from the mix of myths, half-truths, and misleading evaluations that the special-interest groups in American medicine understandably express[ed] and to which the media g[a]ve excessive attention\\u201d (157).  The mis-use of anecdote has been cited as one of the greatest threats to reporting accuracy and in-depth social analysis (Rosenau, \\u201cUS Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 34).  Marmor is particularly sceptical of the mainstream media\\u201fs inclination to dramatize problems. With respect to coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system, he argues that \\u201cas long as stories are the mechanism for understanding Medicare, distortion of the program\\u201fs strengths and weaknesses will continue\\u201d (\\u201cFact and Fiction: The Medicare \\u201eCrisis\\u201f Seen From the US\\u201d 3).  American sociologist Todd Gitlin further recognizes that stereotyping \\u201csolves an 15  enormous number of practical problems in journalism\\u201d, but also propagates inaccuracies and creates barriers to cross-cultural understanding (267).  Yet, while academics may be quick to criticize the work of reporters, it is important to note that a number of journalism industry norms are based in sound judgement.  The emphasis placed on anecdotal information, for example, reflects the underlying view that audiences are more likely to engage with reporting that is conveyed through personal stories.  Reporters must also conform to the ideals of newsworthiness, which includes factors such as timeliness, proximity, prominence, consequence, human interest, and shock value.  Such guidelines thus lead to the selectivity of certain story lines over others.   Today, the wealth of health policy research into cross-border comparisons of medical systems has only grown larger, and arguably led to increased access to information for journalists, the overall improvement of reporting quality, and enhanced public awareness. However, recent examples during America\\u201fs healthcare reform, suggest that partial truths and rhetoric of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems continue to prevail in US public discourse. In 2009, for example, Allan S. Brett  noted that amid all the rhetoric of health care reform in the US \\u2013 the most prominent claim was that single-payer health care \\u2013 \\u201ca Canadian-style Medicare- for-all system \\u2013 [wa]s antithetical to \\u201eAmerican values\\u201f\\u201d (440).  Brett argues that this notion was designed to \\u201cstop discussion of a government-sponsored single-payer system\\u201d in the US (440). According to others, the UK\\u201fs National Health Service also served as \\u201ca \\u201ewhipping boy\\u201f in America\\u201fs [most recent] healthcare debate\\u201d,  inaccurately portrayed as an example of \\u201cthe \\u201efailed Socialist\\u201f model of healthcare\\u201d (Kilkenny).  The fact that unsubstantiated claims over the foreign healthcare experience continue to circulate holds a number of significant consequences to transatlantic learning (Quam and Smith 16  530), and arguably points to the need for improved usage of cross-national research by American journalists who report on foreign healthcare systems.  However, obtaining academic standards of in-depth cross-national analysis may remain an unrealistic expectation of reporters, who work within the framework of an event-driven medium and who face increasing pressure to meet shifting industry demands. 2.6  Summary  To date, studies reveal that US journalistic interest in Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems tends to be intermittent, with influxes reflecting larger policy shifts taking place in the US.  Most scholars indicate that US coverage of Canada tends to focus on the differences, and less so on the similarities between the healthcare systems.  Research also reveals that US news reports of Canada and the UK often rely on stereotypes associated with single-payer public healthcare systems, such as wait times and doctor shortages.  As a point of comparison, it is important to note that examples of inaccurate reporting also appear in US healthcare journalism. The current state of the media industry, particularly economic factors, is cited as a common reason for compromised accuracy of reporting.  Finally, the literature suggests that despite the growth of academic cross-cultural healthcare policy research and analysis over the past several decades, only modest improvement in the state, particularly the complexity, of American reportage of foreign healthcare systems has occurred. 17   3 Hypotheses  The decision to assess US-coverage of the Canadian and UK healthcare systems at this particular point in time stemmed from the supposition that American news coverage would be influenced by a number of time-sensitive factors, including the advent of healthcare reform, and the current state of the media.  In this context, the study explores three major hypotheses.  The initial hypothesis involved the idea that news coverage of Canada and UK\\u201fs healthcare systems in American newspapers would be limited compared to Rosenau\\u201fs study as a result of President Obama\\u201fs early framing of healthcare reform in the US.  Obama maintained that US healthcare reform required a \\u201cuniquely American approach\\u201d \\u2013 a vow that arguably shaped the media\\u201fs subsequent coverage of healthcare in Canada and the UK (Lucas).  As a result, this study anticipated that both Medicare and the NHS would receive somewhat equivalent, but limited attention in all three newspapers.  Within this context, however, a potential focus on Canada was suggested by Obama\\u2019s contention in August, 2009, that Canadians were likely to continue to get dragged in to the debate, despite the fact the Canadian model had no place within America\\u201fs proposed legislation (\\u201cObama: Canada Not a Boogeyman\\u201d).  Reduced coverage of international healthcare plans (Medicare and the NHS) was also anticipated as a result of the depressed state of the media industry, particularly the print industry, which has suffered a steep decline in advertising revenue, sharp cutbacks, and the elimination of newsroom staff (Pew Research Center, \\u201cThe State of the News Media 2009 - Introduction\\u201d). Under such increased financial pressure, reductions in international news, particularly from developed countries like Canada and the UK, which tend to produce less sensational news than 18  developing nations, are to be expected.  It was anticipated that cost-cutting measures in the newsroom would lead to less reporting of both healthcare systems.  Reduced newspaper coverage was also anticipated because of the increasing shift in recent years to on-line reporting.  Since Rosenau\\u2019s study was published half a decade ago, technological advances (and increased newsroom acceptance of online reporting tools) have contributed to increased volume, diversity, and readership of online newspaper content (Newspaper Association of America).  The online journalism boom has seen a parallel decline in print stories, which provide the foundation for this thesis.  I hypothesized that there would be the least amount of international healthcare coverage in USA Today, which is a national newspaper and less likely to cover international stories unless they have a particular connection or local tie to American health reform.  Representing a respected global media outlet, the New York Times was anticipated to have the greatest number of stories, followed by the financially-minded Wall Street Journal.  The second hypothesis tested involved comparing whether US reporting of Medicare is better now than it was during Rosenau\\u201fs study timeframe, and how coverage of Canada\\u201fs system today compares to that of the UK\\u201fs.  As a result of recent increased access to online healthcare research and statistics from both Canada and the UK, American journalists have increased potential to report more accurately, which was anticipated to be observed in articles reviewed in this study.  The Health Council of Canada, the Canadian Institute for Heath Information (CIHI), and the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) are just some of the bodies supporting websites that provide accurate and timely updates on the state of Medicare \\u2013 including research on wait times, primary care, and the future of Canada\\u201fs national pharmaceutical strategy.  Also, in July 2009, the Canadian government introduced PubMed 19  Central Canada (PMC Canada), a free digital archive of published, peer-reviewed health and life- sciences literature, which builds upon the PubMedCentral (PMC) archive in the US (Canadian Institute for Health Information, \\u201cCanada Joins International Efforts to Provide Access to Health Research\\u201d).3  The burgeoning availability of, and increased access to on-line healthcare research in the UK has also been a factor in recent years.  In 2007, for example, UK PubMed Central was launched.  The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, a health technology agency, and the King\\u201fs Fund, an independent charitable organization, also serve as online repositories of research and health policy analysis in the UK.  Perhaps related to improvements in online resources, reporters increasingly rely on obtaining data from the web.  I hypothesized that both of these factors would contribute to high-quality reporting of healthcare in Canada and the UK in US newspapers.  The final hypothesis tested in this study involved exploring whether external factors, particularly the advent of America\\u201fs healthcare reform and the global economic downturn, influenced coverage themes.  This study also anticipated that a number of themes that emerged during Rosenau\\u2019s study, such as \\u201congoing problems paying for universal health care coverage\\u201d, \\u201cwaiting lines for treatment\\u201d, \\u201cprivatization of healthcare\\u201d, and \\u201cdoctor shortages/too few specialists\\u201d would remain pertinent issues in more recent coverage of Canada\\u2019s Medicare system, and would also feature prominently in coverage of Britain\\u2019s NHS (\\u201cUS Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 34).  The carry-over of past themes was anticipated because such matters represent contentious issues that continue to garner attention from politicians and the public in Canada and the UK.  3  PubMed Central Canada is a three-way partnership between the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the National Research Council's Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (NRC-CISTI), and the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). 20   It was further anticipated that a significant percentage of American articles on Medicare and the NHS would deal with fiscal matters, due, in part, to the economic downturn, but also reflecting the characterization of American healthcare reform as a cost-control measure under the Obama administration (Whitesides).  The reform bill, for example, was pushed forward as one of the most significant efforts to reduce the US deficit since the 1990s, and was predicted, once passed, to cut the US federal deficit by $138 billion over a decade (\\u201cUS healthcare bill \\u201ewill reduce deficit by $138bn\\u201f\\u201d).  US coverage of single-payer systems, like Medicare and the NHS, was thus expected to reflect the political rhetoric surrounding US healthcare reform, with articles placing emphasis on the financial perspective. 21   4 Methodology The methodology followed in this thesis substantially replicated that used by Rosenau in order to foster comparisons between the two studies.  However, in order to accommodate the expanded scope and objectives of the thesis, a number of modifications were introduced.  Salient elements of methodology are summarized in the following sections. 4.1 Study Scope  As noted above, this study expanded on Rosenau\\u201fs work in order to accommodate changes that have occurred to the socio-political landscape since the beginning of the 21 st  century and to expand the level of understanding of this subject area.  The present study differs from Rosenau\\u201fs work in three significant ways, which are described below.  TIME FRAME AND DURATION   This study spans the period from January 2008 to the end of March 2010 (two and a quarter years), approximately half the period examined in Rosenau\\u201fs study (five and a half years from January 2000 \\u2013 mid-June 2005).  The narrowed timeframe was chosen deliberately, to satisfy the objective of this thesis to appraise US newspaper coverage at a defining moment in US history \\u2013 the introduction (and implementation) of fundamental health policy change. NEWSPAPER SOURCES  In addition to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, carefully selected by Rosenau as publications that offer political balance, this thesis included articles from one of America\\u201fs highest circulating national papers, USA Today.  By doing so, it provides greater insight into how other factors, such as audience and corporate culture, influence newspaper coverage.  It is worth noting that both the NYT and WSJ were also chosen by Rosenau on the basis that they were two 22  of the top three highest circulating newspapers in the US, and because \\u201cthey have a reputation for reliable, accurate journalism\\u201d (Rosenau, \\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 27). INCORPORATION OF THE NHS  This thesis seeks to fill a significant gap in the literature by examining US print coverage of the United Kingdom\\u201fs National Healthcare Service (NHS) in addition to Medicare.  The NHS was chosen over other foreign healthcare systems because, like Canadian Medicare, it has served as a foil to America\\u201fs largely private insurance based system. 4.2  Data Collection 4.2.1 Database and Search Terms  This thesis sourced articles using Factiva, a database owned by Dow Jones & Company. Factiva was chosen over LexisNexis Academic Universe, the database employed by Rosenau, because it provides full-text article access for all three publications (NYT, WSJ, and USAT), unlike LexisNexis, which only aggregates abstracts, not full articles from The Wall Street Journal. 4   In order to optimize sampling consistency, Rosenau\\u201fs search terms (\\u201cCanada\\u201d in combination with health care, health system, health policy, Medicare, hospital, doctor, and physician), were maintained for the Canadian part of this study. 5   While the terms applying to healthcare were also used for the UK search, the location was duly adjusted to include, and  4  Librarians at the University of British Columbia suggested that using different databases would not make a significant difference to research findings. 5  Canadian search set: Canad* AND (health care OR health system OR health policy OR medicare OR hospital* OR doctor* OR physician*) 23  separately list the four regions (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) where single- payer publically funded healthcare applies in the UK. 6  4.2.2 Inclusion Criteria  Materials for this study were selected on the basis of Rosenau\\u201fs three inclusion criteria: form, word count, and extensive coverage. FORM Like Rosenau\\u201fs study, the purpose of the present study was to determine if US news reporting was fair, accurate, and complete.  The study was therefore limited to news articles, while \\u201cletters to the editor, opinion essays, commentaries, and obituaries were excluded\\u201d (Rosenau, \\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 29). WORD COUNT  While it is worth noting that articles of a shorter length can, and are often influential, Rosenau\\u201fs decision to only retain articles that were a minimum of 500 words was maintained for the purposes of this study to foster accurate comparisons.  A length of 500 words was chosen by Rosenau on the rationale that \\u201can article would have to be of substantial depth and length to be significant in forming public opinion\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 29). EXTENSIVE COVERAGE  Finally, articles where \\u201cthe Canadian health system did not play an important role in an article\\u201d were not included in Rosenau\\u201fs study (29).  In other words, if the article did not substantially consider information about the Canadian healthcare system, it was eliminated from  6  UK search set: (England OR Scotland OR Wales OR Ireland OR NHS OR United Kingdom OR UK OR British OR Britain) AND (health care OR health system OR health policy OR medicare OR hospital OR doctor OR physician). 24  Rosenau\\u201fs and, by extension, from my analysis (30).  For the purpose of this thesis, detailed article summaries provided the basis for determining whether articles were substantive or not. As a case in point, several articles cited Canadian studies on general healthcare matters (such as hip fracture rates), but were excluded because they did not deal with the Canadian healthcare system per se.  Finally, because this study aimed to explore how US newspapers framed and used the Canadian and UK healthcare systems as a discursive tool to inform citizens regarding proposed U.S. health care policy changes, articles that dealt, perhaps only marginally, with the two systems in the context of US healthcare reform were retained for analysis. 4.3 Sample Size  As shown in Table 4.3a on the following page, the search of Factiva yielded a total of 4033 articles. However, while 614 dealt with the Canadian and UK healthcare systems at some level, only 28 (6 on the Canadian healthcare system and 22 on the NHS) met the combined inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis.  After eliminating over 4000 articles on the basis that they did not meet one or more of Rosenau\\u201fs inclusion criteria, 28 articles were retained for analysis. 25  Table 4.3a: Summary of Database Search Outcomes Table 4.3a: Summary of Database Search Outcomes      In Passing Included Included + In Passing Source Total No. % No. % No. %         CANADA NYT 787 156 20% 4 0.5% 160 20.3% WSJ 437 135 31% 1 0.2% 136 31.1% USAT 174 64 37% 1 0.6% 65 37.4% Totals:   1398 355 25.4% 6 0.4% 361 25.8%         UNITED KINGDOM (UK) NYT 1630 131 8.0% 15 0.9% 146 9.0% WSJ 731 98 13.4% 6 0.8% 104 14.2% USAT 274 30 10.9% 1 0.4% 31 11.3% Totals:   2635 259 9.8% 22 0.8% 281 10.7%         COMBINED (CANADA + UK) NYT 2417 287 11.9% 19 0.8% 306 12.7% WSJ 1168 233 19.9% 7 0.6% 240 20.5% USAT 448 94 21.0% 2 0.4% 96 21.4% Totals:   4033 614 15.2% 28 0.7% 642 15.9%   Canada UK Combined   Included + In Passing 361 281 642   Included 6 22 28   Included % 1.7% 7.8% 4.4%   Many articles did not meet two or more of the inclusion parameters; but the most common reason for exclusion was content (see Table 4.3b on the following page).  In fact, close to ninety-seven per cent of all articles satisfying database search criteria were excluded because they were either off-topic entirely, or lacked substantive content on the healthcare systems.  A further thirty-two per cent of articles were excluded because they were not news, while another nineteen per cent were under the 500 word minimum.  Similar to Rosenau\\u201fs study, the majority of articles retained for analysis came from the NYT (19), while only seven were from the WSJ and two from USA Today. 26  Table 4.3b: Article Exclusion Factors  Table 4.3b: Article Exclusion Factors     CANADA Source Not News Under 500 Content NYT 278 146 759 WSJ 116 65 418 USAT 45 42 161 Totals:   439 253 1338     UK Source Not News Under 500 Content NYT 560 288 1596 WSJ 207 156 700 USAT 78 51 272 Totals:   845 495 2586     COMBINED (CANDA + UK) Source Not News Under 500 Content NYT 838 434 2355 WSJ 323 221 1118 USAT 123 93 433 Totals Exclusions:   1284 748 3906 Total Articles: 4033 4033 4033 Percentage Excluded: 32% 19% 97%  4.4 Data Analysis  For a number of practical reasons, Rosenau chose to perform the content analysis without computerized assistance.  She notes that the \\u201cdiversity of topics covered in the newspaper articles would make the \\u201esystematic application of rules,\\u201f required by this technique, almost impossible\\u201d, and argues further that \\u201cthe coding strategies that computerized systems of automatic content analysis employ often miss topics or themes\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of 27  the Canadian Health System\\u201d 30).  Similarly, the research for this study was also performed without content analysis software.  Both the quantitative and qualitative analyses for this study were adapted from Rosenau\\u201fs analysis, which was predominantly quantitative and \\u201cbased on a simple count of characteristics of the articles\\u201d, such as reporting dimensions and article themes (Rosenau, \\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 29).  However, applying Rosenau\\u2019s established coding scheme only represented part of the analysis for this study.  In order to accommodate developments in the Canadian healthcare system that have taken place since Rosenau\\u201fs study, and to further address issues specific to US healthcare reform and the addition of the NHS to this study, the coding scheme was slightly adjusted.  This adjustment involved the inclusion of emergent themes, arising since Rosenau\\u201fs study, which were identified and applied to all articles within the sample.  Like Rosenau\\u201fs work, this study appraised the accuracy of newspaper coverage on the basis of how closely results aligned with established knowledge of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare system in peer reviewed journals and government sources.7 4.5 Reporting Dimensions  The accuracy, fairness, and comprehensiveness of US newspaper coverage was assessed using Rosenau\\u201fs coding scheme, which analyzed each article on the basis of six reporting dimensions: 1) the proportion of news events versus ongoing theme stories, 2) the role of evidence versus anecdote, 3) the incidence of oversimplification/omission, 4) the appearance of material taken out of context, 5) the presence of incomplete information due to the exclusion of essential details, and 6) the degree to which reporting leads to confusion or factual errors  7  Results were further scrutinized by health economist Dr. Steve Morgan, who is the Associate Director for the Centre for Health Services and Policy Research and an associate professor with the University of British Columbia\\u201fs School of Population and Public Health.  28  (Rosenau, \\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 30).   These dimensions, including implications to this thesis, are described further in the following sections. THE PROPORTION OF NEWS EVENTS VERSUS ONGOING THEME STORIES:  Articles were first classified as either hard news (defined as event-related or episodic), or soft news, which Rosenau defined as discretionary coverage, \\u201cabout ongoing themes or controversial issues\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 31). THE ROLE OF EVIDENCE VERSUS ANECDOTE:  Articles were further tracked on the basis of whether they employed anecdotal information (human interest stories, focusing on individuals and real world experiences) or evidence (stories that focus on facts and figures), or a combination of the two. THE INCIDENCE OF OVERSIMPLIFICATION/OMISSION:  Oversimplification and or omission, as classified by Rosenau, refers to the tendency among journalists to generalize the Canadian health care system \\u201cas a national, single payer system dominated by the Canadian federal government\\u201d, downplaying the importance of local input and variation between provincial systems (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 36).  The National Health Service, as four single-payer healthcare systems within the United Kingdom, is similarly complex.  In this study, articles were determined to be oversimplified if they portrayed either the Canadian or UK healthcare systems as a unified system, without administrative variation between geographical regions. THE APPEARANCE OF MATERIAL TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT:  Material was deemed out of context with respect to three coverage trends : 1) failing to portray the Canadian or UK health system in the context of other Western industrialized countries (Rosenau\\u201fs study looked at this matter with specific respect to wait times), 2) implying that privatization of either healthcare systems would directly reduce and \\u201esolve\\u201f the problem of 29  wait times, and 3) not adequately identifying and providing the intellectual orientation of information sources, such as the Canadian think tank, the Fraser Institute.  For the purposes of this study, articles that failed to examine contentious healthcare issues (such as wait times and doctor shortages) in the context of other Western industrialized nations (trend 1) were also assessed as material being taken out of context. THE PRESENCE OF INCOMPLETE INFORMATION DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ESSENTIAL DETAILS:  Reporting was determined to be incomplete based on the exclusion of essential details, which Rosenau defined as: 1) favouritism of certain geographical regions over others 2) failure to mention important facts required for an adequate understanding waiting lists, and 3) the misinterpretation of why some Canadians cross the border to receive healthcare in the US (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 39-42).  For the analysis of UK articles, the geographical regions were adjusted appropriately for trend 1), while trend 3) was revised to read: the misinterpretation of why individuals in the UK travel to receive health services abroad (Europe or the US). THE DEGREE TO WHICH REPORTING LEADS TO CONFUSION OR FACTUAL ERRORS:  Coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system was considered inaccurate, and believed to lead to confusion or factual error if it indicated that Medicare was \\u201cleftist\\u201d or socialist.  As Rosenau indicates, \\u201cthe role of the private sector in the Canadian health system is substantial and the delivery of medical care is predominately private\\u201d, which means that, although \\u201cCanadian hospitals are largely private-non-profit rather than private-for-profit\\u201d\\u201f this form of ownership \\u201cdoes not qualify as \\u201esocialist\\u201f\\u201d or \\u201c\\u201egovernment\\u201f owned\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 43).  Reporting that made the assumption that Canadians would trade their single-payer public healthcare system for the US system or not recommend Medicare to those in the US was also deemed factually inaccurate (43-44). 30   In the strictest sense, the NHS could be defined as \\u201eleftist\\u201f or \\u201esocialist.\\u201f  However, these terms are politically charged and generally misrepresent the UK\\u201fs healthcare system.  For this study, reporting of the NHS was classified inaccurate or capable of leading to confusion if it demonized the government while sympathizing with upset or angry patients, or downplayed the role and complexity of healthcare administration.  Reporting was also considered confused if an article made the assumption that UK citizens would like to trade their healthcare system for one like the US or would never recommend the NHS to those in the US. 4.5.1 Thematic Analysis  The second component of this study, also adopted from Rosenau, involved a thematic analysis of each of the selected articles, which were closely examined and categorized based on the presence of overt content referring to one or more of the themes.  This study analyzed articles and recorded the presence of Rosenau\\u201fs themes, as well as emergent issues in the context of Canadian and UK healthcare. 31   5 Results  My analysis revealed three major findings with respect to the quantity and quality of American coverage of Medicare and the NHS.  The main finding was that representation of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system was narrow compared to coverage during Rosenau\\u201fs timeframe, and that healthcare in the UK received greater coverage in US newspapers than Canada between 2008 and the first quarter of 2010.  The second finding was that the quality of reporting on Canadian healthcare is slightly better compared to coverage during Rosenau\\u201fs study period. American coverage of the NHS appears, on the other hand, slightly less accurate and balanced than treatment of Canadian Medicare.  Finally, the thematic analysis revealed that US media interest in Canadian healthcare has shifted slightly since Rosenau\\u201fs study, and was affected by global events, such as the Olympics and the outbreak of H1N1.  Coverage themes of the NHS tended to focus on financial concerns and rationing of treatment, and were overall more varied compared to coverage themes of Medicare.  It is important to note that these results are limited to the articles included in this study sample, and cannot be generalized or extended to publications beyond the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, or outside of the study\\u201fs timeframe (January, 2008  through to the first quarter of 2010). 5.1 Finding 1: Overall Representation in US Newspaper Coverage  While a large number of articles satisfied the search criteria for Canadian healthcare, a surprisingly small number, only six articles, met the inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis.  This represents less than two per cent of the total number of articles yielded from the database search.  Of these six articles, the NYT provided the bulk of coverage, with 4 articles, 32  followed by one article from the WSJ and one from USA Today.  In Rosenau\\u201fs analysis of 50 newspaper articles referencing Canada\\u201fs healthcare system, the NY Times\\u2019s coverage was most comprehensive (38 articles), followed by 12 from the WSJ.  American media provided more coverage of the UK\\u201fs National Health Service. A total of 22 articles were retained for analysis, with the NY Times again providing the greatest amount of coverage, (19), followed by the WSJ (7) and USA Today (2). For more detail, see Table 4.3a and 4.3b (above), which summarize the database search outcomes and factors for article exclusion respectively. 5.2  Finding 2: Accuracy, Balance, and Completeness of Coverage  This analysis revealed that the quality of Canadian healthcare coverage is better (more accurate, balanced, and complete) compared to earlier examples of newspaper reporting assessed by Rosenau.  The quality of US reporting of the NHS was reasonably good, but a subtle difference in quality is indicated when compared with US coverage of Canada.  As mentioned above, the accuracy, balance, and completeness of coverage for this study was determined using Rosenau\\u201fs coding scheme: the proportion of hard vs. soft news, the role of evidence vs. anecdote, incidence of oversimplification/omission, the appearance of material taken out of context, the exclusion of essential details, and the degree to which reporting leads to confusion or factual error.  The prominence and influence of each of these factors are explored below in greater detail. 1) The proportion of news events versus ongoing theme stories  Hard news, or event-driven coverage of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system represented 67 per cent of articles in this analysis (see Table 5.2.1a on the following page).  Soft news, on the other hand, was more limited (33 per cent), compared to Rosenau\\u201fs study, which found that soft news 33  accounted for 46 per cent of her sample.  In Rosenau\\u201fs view, soft news \\u201cplay[ed] an unexpectedly important role in what [was] published in U.S. newspapers about the Canadian health system\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 31).  She states that many of the thematic topics (eg: waiting lines for treatment, jumping cues for care) reflect a general frustration with the public health care system, which may have led newspaper readers to think that Canadians were fundamentally dissatisfied with Medicare (33). Table 5.2.1a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada \\u2013 Dimension 1 Dimension 1:  Articles Citing News Events vs. Ongoing Theme Stories (Canada)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year Hard Soft Hard Soft Hard Soft Hard Soft 2008 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 2009 3 0 0 1 0 0 3 1 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 3 1 0 1 1 0 4 2 G.Total 4 1 1 6 % 75.0% 25.0% 0.0% 100.0% 100.0% 0.0% 66.7% 33.3%   Academics, like Rosenau, often note that soft news coverage tends to be more critical in perspective than episodic coverage (Collins et al. \\u201cAre we expecting too much from print media?\\u201d 99). It is problematic to conjecture that a form of news is a direct reflection of reporting accuracy.  However, on the basis Rosenau\\u201fs evaluation of soft-news coverage as tending to highlight and reflect controversial themes, the significant role that hard news played in coverage of Canada in this particular analysis reveals there was perhaps, at the very least, less room for bias.  Reporting of the UK\\u201fs healthcare system was slightly more reliant on soft-news (45 per cent) than reporting of Medicare (see Table 5.2.1b on the following page).  Thematic coverage, particularly issues related to paying for universal healthcare, medical tourism, and rationing, 34  represented an important part of American newspaper coverage of the NHS, a finding that will be explored in greater detail below (Finding 3: Coverage Themes).

However, it is important to note that all articles contained evidence, with anecdote playing a factor in only a half of the sample. Table 5.2.2a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada \\u2013 Dimension 2 Dimension 2:  Articles Citing Evidence vs. Anecdote (Canada)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid.

Rosenau notes that \\u201csometimes isolated cases of medical error [were] presented as routine\\u201d, and that injustices were portrayed as \\u201cfrequent, typical, and widely 35  tolerated\\u201d (35).  However, overall, most articles in Rosenau\\u201fs study were also a mix of anecdote and evidence/facts, with \\u201conly eight [that] made no reference at all to sound evidence\\u201d (26).  While Rosenau notes that \\u201cheavy reliance on anecdotal information means that sophisticated social analyses, fine distinctions, and subtle differences are overlooked\\u201d, it is also important to recognize that the mere presence of anecdote is not necessarily indicative of poor reporting (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 44).  Instead, anecdotal information serves as a useful tool for reporters to highlight a case in point, or to bring the story to life for readers.  The inclusion of anecdote only becomes problematic when it is used to over- generalize, or stand as evidence in support of a false claim.  In this study, anecdotal information was justified and appropriately used in all articles on Canadian healthcare.  US coverage of the NHS was also a mix of evidence and anecdote (see Table 5.2.2b below).  All articles contained evidence, and 55 per cent also contained anecdote. Table 5.2.2b: Reporting Dimensions for UK \\u2013 Dimension 2 Dimension 2:  Articles Citing Evidence vs. Anecdote (UK)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec.

One article, which explored the debate over creating a national long-term care system for elderly in England and Wales, appears to argue in favour of elder-care reform and evokes sympathy by framing the article around a London resident, who wants additional home support but cannot afford it (Appendix A, Werdigier \\u201cIn Britain, a Debate Over Home Care for Elderly People\\u201d).  In brief, anecdote is used as a narrative device to encourage reader interest and 36  address journalism norms of humanizing policy news.  However, factual evidence that supports a more nuanced understanding of elder care 8  is only presented later in the article, which serves to downplay important factors required for understanding elder-care reform issues in Britain (n.pag).   In another article, the story of an upset cancer patient looking to supplement her publicly financed cancer treatment with private co-payments is used as evidence of systematic failure (Appendix A, Lyall \\u201cThose Who Pay for Private Care Are Testing Britain\\u201fs Public Health System\\u201d).  The reporter advocates for the patient, noting that the British health service has denied the patient Avastin, a drug that is noted to be widely used in the US and Europe to keep cancers at bay (n.pag). By adding information, such as the fact that the patient has turned to raising thousands of dollars and was \\u201cpreparing to sell her house to raise more\\u201d, the reporter garners an emotional response from the reader (n.pag).  Only later does the article note that a number of outstanding considerations were involved with this particular case, a brief indication that not all individuals in Britain are being denied new treatments under the UK\\u201fs healthcare system.  In summary, while this particular story certainly highlights anomalies in treatment rules under the NHS, it unnecessarily demonizes the British government, sympathizes with the patient and her advocating doctor, and simplifies the complexity of factors that are used to review and make decisions as to which drugs should be publically financed in the UK (n.pag).  In addition, more often than not, cost is implied as the only factor weighed to make such decisions. Also of interest is the fact that in an article focused on patient access to expensive drugs for cancer, no reference is made to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which  8  Evidence later mentioned in the article included: the fact that state-financed care is already available to seniors with low incomes, that the current generation of pensioners is Britain\\u201fs wealthiest, and that enacting a national long- term care system for the elderly alongside the health care system would place greater financial strain on a government looking to cut its \\u201crecord budget deficit\\u201d (Appendix A, Werdigier \\u201cIn Britain, a Debate Over Home Care for Elderly People\\u201d n.pag). 37  makes recommendations to the NHS on medicines, treatments, and procedures (based on efficacy and cost-effectiveness).  However, NICE serves a central role in another article that speaks to the issue of Britain\\u201fs efforts to balance the benefit (life-value) vs. the cost of new drugs (Appendix A, Harris \\u201cBritish Balance Benefit Vs. Cost of Latest Drugs\\u201d).  The story illustrates the moral issues facing the healthcare system through the story of one man who is fighting kidney cancer that has spread to his lungs.  Discussion of the institute and the British government is framed in a negative light. The reporter expresses clear sympathy for the patient, who is interested in receiving a new, yet expensive cancer treatment (a pill from Pfizer known as Sutent).  It is strongly noted that the patient has been \\u201crefused medicine\\u201d by \\u201cthe British health authorities\\u201d (n.pag).  At \\u201can estimated treatment cost of $54,000\\u201d, the reporter comes to the conclusion that that the patient\\u201fs \\u201clife is not worth prolonging, according to the British government agency\\u201d (n.pag).  The article further juxtaposes the patient\\u201fs chances of survival in the UK with his opportunities if he had lived in the United States (\\u201cor just about any European country other than Britain\\u201d), where, the article states, he would most likely get the drug (n.pag). In effect, NICE is portrayed as a stringent rationing body that puts a price tag (of \\u201c$15,000 or about $22,750\\u201d) on citizen\\u201fs lives, while other systems are illustrated as offering a more humane response to serious cancers (n.pag).  This article later exemplifies more nuanced journalism, qualifying its framing of NICE through a discussion of drug costs.  It indicates, for example, that the NHS has been recognized as a global leader for being \\u201camong the first to balk\\u201d at paying high prices (Appendix A, Harris \\u201cBritish Balance Benefit Vs. Cost of Latest Drugs\\u201d).  The reporter also makes reference to America\\u201fs interest (and growing concern) with controlling drug and device expenses, and cites that US experts believe \\u201c\\u201epeople see NICE as the only workable paradigm\\u201f\\u201d (n.pag).  However, 38  the benefits of NICE and US interest in implementing cost-control measures are downplayed for the most part, as the article concludes with a moving image of the cancer victim barely able to speak because of the tumour \\u201cpress[ing] on a nerve that governs his voice\\u201d and his wife, who now speaks for her husband, asking \\u201c\\u201cWhat price is life?\\u201f\\u201d (n.pag).  Framed around a cancer victim\\u201fs struggle, the article paints a picture of a somewhat heartless and cost-concerned governing health body, leaving unaddressed questions that might ameliorate that image, such as the fact that the patient is undoubtedly already undergoing NHS-financed treatment.  The article also attaches little attention the fact that Sutent, which a clinical trial showed to delay cancer progression \\u201cfor six months\\u201d, comes at a high cost of treatment \\u2013 an estimated $54,000 \\u2013 to the healthcare system (n.pag).  Overall, the conflicting portrayal of NICE in US newspaper coverage points to the general challenges of exploring the complexities of healthcare in newspapers.  As the above- mentioned articles illustrate, while anecdote draws readers in, over-emphasis on a single event or character can lead to coverage that is slanted. 3) The incidence of oversimplification/omission  In this study, (see Table 5.2.3a on the following page) a third of articles presented Canadian Medicare as a unified system, illustrating that reporting may stand to benefit from greater attention to provincial variation.  In contrast, Rosenau found that US journalists were largely unaware of the enormous power of Canadian provinces and often depicted them \\u201cas simply administering the federally organized health system\\u201d, similar to the \\u201crelationship between the U.S. federal government and the states\\u201d (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 36). 39  Table 5.2.3a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada \\u2013 Dimension 3 Dimension 3:  Articles that Oversimplify (or Omit Content) (Canada)              Year NYT WSJ USAT Totals       2008 1 0 0 1       2009 1 0 0 1       2010 0 0 0 0   Total 2 0 0 2   %       33.3%   Oversimplification in US coverage of the NHS was a factor in less than 20 per cent of articles (see Table 5.2.3b below).  In fact, some articles highlighted differences in treatment availability across the British Isles.  In one article, for example, elder-care reform in England and Wales was the focus, but attention was also drawn to elder-care policy in Scotland, where, it was noted, \\u201csome home care has been free since 2002\\u201d (Appendix A, Werdigier \\u201cIn Britain, a Debate Over Home Care For Elderly People\\u201d).

The article focused on the potential impact of severe cases of H1N1 on intensive care units (ICUs) in America, highlighting results from international studies that examined the severity of swine flu cases in Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand (Appendix A McKay \\u201cSwine-Flue Wave Poses Threat to Hospitals ICUS, Studies 40  Warn\\u201d).  The article was earmarked as an example of unbalanced reporting and inadequate contextualization (1) because it emphasized supply shortages and high occupancy levels in Canada\\u2019s ICUs at the height of the outbreak, but failed to reference study results from nations other than Mexico, leaving readers without a suitable comparison for understanding the challenges facing other Western industrialized nations (particularly Australia and New Zealand). Table 5.2.4a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada \\u2013 Dimension 4   Dimension 4:  Articles Citing Material out of Context (Canada)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2009 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 Gp. Total 0 1 0 1 % 0.0% 16.7% 0.0% 16.7%  The rare incidence of material taken out of context in this study stands out against Rosenau\\u2019s analysis, which detected that newspaper articles often took material out of context, particularly by (1) not placing Canada\\u2019s wait times in the context of other Western industrialized nations, (2) framing privatization as the solution to long wait times, and (3) inadequately identifying the intellectual orientation of Canadian-based information sources (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 38).  As noted in Table 5.2.4b on the following page, coverage of the UK involved six articles with material taken out of context.  The most common issue (1) was for journalists to report on controversial issues, such as wait times and overcrowding, while overlooking what the situation was like in other Western industrialized nations. 41  Table 5.2.4b: Reporting Dimensions for UK \\u2013 Dimension 4   Dimension 4:  Articles Citing Material out of Context (UK)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 2009 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 4 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 Gp.

Most articles on Canada\\u201fs healthcare system, for example, had a national focus (six references), with passing mention of healthcare matters affecting five out of Canada\\u201fs ten provinces: Alberta, BC, Manitoba, Quebec, and Ontario (1 reference each).  However, considering the small sample size, even limited representation of healthcare at the territorial and provincial level remains commendable.  Other factors believed to be responsible for incomplete reporting in this study, including (2) failure to mention important facts needed to understand Canada\\u2019s wait times (no articles) and (3) misinterpretation of why some Canadians cross the border to receive healthcare (one article), were not significant. 42  Table 5.2.5a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada \\u2013 Dimension 5   Dimension 5:  Articles Incomplete Due to Exclusion of Essential Details (Canada)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 1 (N) 0 0 1(N) 0 0 1  (N) 0 0 5 0 0         1(M)     1  (Q) 2009 3 (N) 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 1   1 (O)   1 (A)   1 (B) 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 7 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 11 0 1  During the timeframe of Rosenau\\u201fs study, articles with a national focus made up over half of Canadian coverage. Similarly, US coverage of the Canadian healthcare system favoured particular geographical areas and neglected others.  Rosenau notes that thirty eight per cent of articles published \\u201cfocused on the Ontario health system\\u201d, while, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec were the focus of only two per cent of the sample (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 39).  Rosenau acknowledges that Ontario was a focus of many articles simply because \\u201cit was the geographical location of the breaking news\\u201d, but argues that the Ontario was also a heavy focus of many discretionary articles about thematic topics, indicating the existence of provincial favouritism in US coverage of Canadian healthcare (39).  In this study, similar to US coverage of Medicare, the most common factor leading to incomplete information of the NHS was (1) geographical favouritism (see Table 5.2.5b on the following page).  Britain was the focus of most articles with a total of 22 references, followed by Scotland (5 references), and Wales (4 references).  Some articles also had a national focus (4 references), but healthcare in Northern Ireland, which is part of the broader National Health Service, was neglected completely. 43  Table 5.2.5b: Reporting Dimensions for UK \\u2013 Dimension 5   Dimension 5:  Articles Incomplete Due to Exclusion of Essential Details (UK)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 6 (B) 1 0 2 (B) 0 0 1 (B) 0 0 15 1 0   1 (S)     1 (N)     1 (S)   2 (N)           1 (W) 2009 6 (B) 0 0 4 (B) 0 0 0 0 0 15 0 0   1 (S)     1 (B)   1 (W)     2 (N) 2010 2 (B) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0   2 (S)   2 (W) Total 23 1 0 10 0 0 3 0 0 36 1 0 6) The degree to which reporting leads to confusion or factual error  No articles in the present study (1) portrayed Medicare as \\u201esocialist\\u201f or \\u201eleftist\\u201f or (2) made the assumption that Canadians would like to trade Medicare for the US system (see Table 5.2.6a on the following page).  In fact, one article published by the New York Times actually sought to clarify Senator John McCain\\u201fs comments leading up to healthcare reform in the US, in which he accused Obama of wanting to implement a massive government takeover of healthcare in America, and further characterized the Canadian healthcare system in disparaging terms (Appendix A, Cooper and Bosman \\u201cParsing McCain on the Democrats\\u201f Health Plan\\u201d).  The article mitigated McCain\\u201fs statement, noting that \\u201cMr. McCain, of Arizona, has inaccurately described the Democrats\\u201f healthcare proposals, using language that evokes the spectre of socialized medicine\\u201d, further indicating that Canadians do not have government-run healthcare, but a single-payer system (n.pag). 44  Table 5.2.6a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada \\u2013 Dimension 6 Dimension 6:  Articles Where Reporting Leads to Confusion / Errors (Canada)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2008 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2009 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  In contrast, Rosenau found that U.S. newspaper coverage of the Canadian health system was confused on the basis that at least one quarter of her sample articles indicated that the system was \\u201cleftist\\u201d or socialist, despite the fact that very few Canadian doctors work for the government, but are \\u201centrepreneurs to some extent\\u201d, paid on a fee-for-service basis (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d43).  A second inaccuracy that led to confused reporting during Rosenau\\u201fs study was \\u201cthe assumption that Canadians would like to trade their health system for the U.S. health system, or that they would never recommend the Canadian health system to those in the U.S.\\u201d (43-44).  While some Canadians are critical of their healthcare system, Rosenau noted that \\u201cit would be a mistake to interpret this criticism as an approval\\u201d among Canadians to adopt a US style health system (44).  In US coverage of the NHS factual error and reporting that could lead to confusion were rare (see Table 5.2.6b on the following page).  In one article, however, the NHS, while never referred to as a socialist or leftist, was nonetheless depicted as such, in part by repeated emphasis on the \\u201esick\\u201f and \\u201einnocent\\u201f patient being denied service at the hands of the \\u201egovernment\\u201f (Appendix A, Lyall \\u201cThose Who Pay for Private Care Are Testing Britain\\u201fs Public Health System\\u201d).  Yet, overall efforts were made to redress stereotypes of the NHS (particularly those that emerged during Obama\\u201fs proposed reforms).  One Associated Press article that was published by the New York Times (the only wire service article included in the sample) noted that 45  even though \\u201cthe British love to mock their National Health Service\\u201d, they do not want it \\u201cdismantled or transformed into an American-style, profit-oriented system\\u201d (Appendix A, AP \\u201cBritain Responds to Criticism of Its Universal Health System\\u201d).

In contrast, Rosenau identified twenty themes, with the top three most prevalent issues being: ongoing problems paying for universal health care coverage in Canada, waiting lines for treatment, and privatization of healthcare.  Themes that also arose more often than others in Rosenau\\u201fs analysis included: doctor shortages/too few specialists, importing prescription drugs from Canada, Canadians traveling to the U.S. for health care treatment, overflowing emergency rooms, and medical technology shortages and slow adoption of technology (\\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d34). 46  Table 5.3: Thematic Coverage for Canada and the UK 9   Table 5.3: Thematic Coverage (Canada + UK)      Canada UK No. Themes NYT WSJ USAT NYT WSJ USAT 1 Top heavy bureaucracy       9.1% 4.5% 2 Challenges of accessing medical records by new clinics       4.5% 3 International collaboration on health programs and policies       9.1% 4 Emerging innovation in healthcare venues       9.1% 5 Drug financing (surrounding issues of efficacy vs. cost)       9.1% 4.5% 6 Financial constraints on purchase of medical technology       4.5% 7 Funding challenges in eldercare reform       4.5% 8 Ongoing problems paying for universal healthcare       27.3% 9 Doctor shortage / too few specialists       4.5% 4.5% 10 Importing medical supplies to address local shortages       4.5% 11 Limitations on medical resources and services       13.6% 4.5% 12 Medical technology shortages / slow adoption of technol.   16.7% 13 Wait lines for treatment 66.7%     22.7% 4.5% 14 Concern over maintaining core values of existing healthcare system       9.1% 4.5% 15 Jumping wait lines affluent and connected 33.3% 16 Patient demand for longer work hours by family doctors / clinics       9.1% 17 Regional disparity re: access to drugs and treatment       18.2% 18 Universal healthcare preventing medical bankruptcy of patients       4.5% 4.5% 19 Criticism of existing preventative diagnostics       4.5% 20 Criticism of hospital conditions (crowding, staffing, cleanliness)       9.1% 21 Health system is losing public confidence       4.7% 4.5% 22 Canadian patients traveling to US for treatment 16.7% 23 UK citizens seeking medical treatment abroad       18.2% 9.1% 24 NHS as an international leader in prescription drug policy       4.5% 25 Patients importing prescription drugs from foreign countries       4.5% 26 Prescription drug advertising regulations     16.7% 27 Doctors against public health insurance       9.1% 28 Patients paying out-of-pocket for healthcare       4.5% 29 Privatization of healthcare       4.5% 9.1% 30 Abortion debate           4.5% 31 Changing guidelines re: legality of assisted suicide       9.1% 4.5% 32 Pursuit of prevention as a key aspect of healthcare       9.1% 9.1% 33 Backlash to negative US portrayal of local system wrt US reform       9.1% 4.5% 34 Healthcare system characterized negatively by US reform opponents 33.3%     13.6% 4.5% 35 Healthcare system characterized positively wrt US reform       4.5%   Total Articles:   6 22   Total Number of Themes 6 31   Total Theme Incidents:   11 81   9  Note that percentages are based off of number of articles that contained the theme.  47   While some of Rosenau\\u201fs themes remained relevant to articles included in this study, most did not, indicating that American media interest in Canada has shifted.  Two themes new to this study were negative characterization of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system by US reform opponents (one third of the sample), and, more peripherally, prescription drug advertising regulations (in the context of a study exploring television access to and influence of US direct-to-consumer advertising in Quebec versus Canada\\u201fs English-speaking provinces).  It is interesting to note that important issues, such as Canada\\u201fs doctor shortages and increased experimentation with privatization, which have received ample domestic coverage in recent years, were largely ignored.  However, as in earlier coverage, US journalists remain highly interested in Canadian wait lines (a theme present in two-thirds of the sample), and placed emphasis on the issue of jumping wait lines by affluent and connected Canadians.  In one article, for example, waiting times for treatments are characterized as a \\u201cperpetual political issue for Canada\\u201fs public health-care system\\u201d, and reader comments offered on the CBC\\u201fs website are cited as evidence that \\u201cany suggestion that a particular group might receive priority can be explosive\\u201d (Appendix A, Austen \\u201cTeam Canada\\u201fs Doctor Wants His Athletes in Front for Swine Flu Shots\\u201d).  Another article, focusing on a Canadian \\u201cswine flu distribution brouhaha\\u201d, highlighted public disproval with respect to connected members of the Canadian population (members of the Calgary Flames hockey team and their families) jumping \\u201clong public lines\\u201d to receive vaccination \\u201cone day before the province cancelled mass immunizations after demand created shortage\\u201d (Appendix A, McNeil \\u201cOfficial Endorses Workplace Clinics for Vaccine Distribution\\u201d).  This article reveals that a second member of the Alberta provincial health administration lost his job over the issue, a 48  statement that highlights the fact that equality remains a fundamental value of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system. 5.3.2 UK \\u2013 Wait Lines, Medical Tourism, and Financial Framing  US newspaper coverage of the NHS was much more varied, with a total of 31 coverage themes ranging from poor hospital conditions to top heavy bureaucracy, to more positive issues, like the emergence of innovative healthcare venues and the pursuit of preventions as a key aspect of healthcare in the UK (see Table 5.3 above).  Similar to US coverage of Canadian healthcare, wait lines featured prominently in coverage of the NHS (27 per cent of the sample).   Another prominent theme in US newspaper coverage of healthcare in the UK was medical or health tourism, with one third of articles (27 per cent) making reference to citizens seeking treatment or medical services abroad (either in the US or other European countries). One article cited the practice of UK citizens seeking private, cosmetic surgery in the US as a growing trend (Appendix A, Rundle \\u201cEuropeans Take Beauty Trip to U.S.\\u201d), while another reflected on individuals travelling to countries, like Spain and Belgium, to obtain sperm donations because of low-supply in Britain (Appendix A, Grady and Kent \\u201cShortage of Sperm Donors in Britain Prompts Calls for Change\\u201d).  Another common issue, related to the broader category of medical tourism, was euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, which is currently illegal in the UK, but which was referenced as a medical procedure that \\u201cdozens of terminally ill Britons\\u201d had sought abroad (in Switzerland) over the last decade (Appendix A, Lyall \\u201cBBC Host Admits Killing Ailing Partner\\u201d).  The thematic analysis of US newspaper coverage of the NHS further exposed a financial frame, which ran through nearly a third of the articles.  Reporting frequently reflected, for example, on ongoing problems paying for universal healthcare in the UK.  In fact, references to 49  the high cost of providing universal healthcare (Appendix A, Werdigier \\u201cIn Britain, a Debate Over Home Care for Elderly People\\u201d)and statements that portrayed the NHS as a system struggling to cope with rising medical costs were not uncommon (Appendix A, Grady \\u201cShortage of Sperm Donors in Britain Prompts Calls for Change\\u201d).  However, it is important to note that reporting that framed the NHS in a critical light was also balanced by positive coverage.  Some reporters, for example, highlighted the UK\\u201fs dedication to preventative health measures (such as public health campaigns and flu vaccination safeguards and monitoring) (Appendix A, Dewan \\u201cRegarding Tamiflu, Doctors and Patients Face a Question of When to Act\\u201d).  Furthermore, on the flip side of coverage representing NICE as a threatening rationing body, another angle emerged, which, as noted above, framed the institute as a global leader in cost-effective research and one whose decisions are seen affecting market shifts in the pharmaceutical industry (Appendix A, Harris \\u201cBritish Balance Benefit vs. Cost of Latest Drugs\\u201d). 5.4 Summary of Findings  Based on an evaluation of the six reporting dimensions, the quality of US newspaper coverage of the Canadian healthcare system appears somewhat better compared to Rosenau\\u201fs study timeframe.  Incidences of material taken out of context, for example, were rare and no articles presented factually inaccurate information that would have led readers to mistakenly perceive Canada\\u201fs healthcare system as socialist.  Representation of the NHS, which was more reliant on thematic coverage (or soft-news), was somewhat less accurate than coverage of Canada.  Factors, such as inadequate contextualization and the frequency at which anecdotal information served to frame the NHS in a negative light, were to blame.  With respect to coverage themes, wait lines remained dominant, but there was also a slight shift in interest since 50  Rosenau\\u201fs study timeframe (with topics reflecting issues related to global events, particularly the outbreak of H1N1, as well as US healthcare reform).  Emphasis was also placed on wait lines in US newspaper coverage of the UK\\u201fs healthcare system, but overall a broader range of issues related to the NHS (compared to Medicare) were represented in American newspaper coverage, due, in part, to the larger sample size of articles on the UK system. 51   6 Discussion  Both the quantity and quality of American newspaper reporting can be explained, at least in part, by examining external factors at play during this study\\u201fs timeframe.  I suggest that shifts in the journalism industry, economic pressures, and America\\u201fs inward focus on healthcare reform influenced the overall quantity of coverage of foreign healthcare.  I further suggest that coverage was thematically influenced by Obama\\u201fs early framing of healthcare as a matter of economic sustainability. 6.1 Quantity of Foreign Healthcare News Coverage  Between January, 2008 and the first quarter of 2010, a number of newsworthy healthcare events occurred beyond the American border.  In Canada alone, for example, a number of controversial healthcare incidents took place.  Particularly memorable headlines included: \\u201c$30,000 for 78 hours: Scandal grows at eHealth Ontario\\u201d (June 2009), \\u201cManitoba First Nations outraged over H1N1 body-bag shipments\\u201d (September 2009), \\u201cSaint John doctor shortages forces weekend closure of Sussex ER\\u201d (April 2009), \\u201cN.L. Premier Williams set to have heart surgery in U.S.\\u201d (February, 2010), and \\u201cWoman sues surgeon, hospital over mastectomy done amid no-cancer diagnosis\\u201d (March 2010).  However, none of these stories were represented in US publications, specifically the NYT, WSJ, or USA Today.  Reasons for more narrow US coverage of Canadian healthcare compared to Rosenau\\u201fs study period, and variance between Canada and the UK, can be explained by looking at pressures facing today\\u201fs journalism industry and the influence of politics in America. 52  6.1.1 Journalistic Pressures  Examples of journalistic factors that may have been responsible for the quantity of articles available on Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems include: low US media (and perceived public) interest in foreign healthcare stories, fiscal pressures within the newsroom, and the growing emphasis and worth placed on online news. The State of the Media: Drops in Ad Revenue and International Coverage  The slight amount of coverage of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare system in the NYT, WSJ, and USA Today illustrates that there is a close tie between economics and the quantity (and quality) of journalism produced.  Over the last several years, the journalism industry has been defined by steep drops in advertising revenue, sharp cutbacks, and the elimination of entire newsroom positions at local, national, and international levels.  Newspapers have been hit particularly hard, entering into \\u201csomething perilously close to free fall\\u201d (Pew Research Center, \\u201cThe State of the News Media 2009\\u201d 9).  News coverage of foreign healthcare was likely further impacted by the accelerated decline of international news in recent years.  A 2008 study conducted by the Pew Research Center\\u201fs Project for Excellence in Journalism, for example, revealed that \\u201cpapers both large and small have reduced the space, resources, and commitment devoted to a range of topics\\u201d, but emphasized that \\u201cinternational news is rapidly losing ground at rates greater than any other topic area\\u201d (\\u201cThe Changing Newsroom\\u201d). Limited Journalistic Interest in Healthcare  Complementing the impact of restrictive newsroom budgets and the decline of international news, American media interest in Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems may have also been limited as a result of lowered editorial interest in investigative and analytical 53  healthcare coverage overall.  In \\u201cThe State of Health Journalism in the US\\u201d it is noted that a shift in the nature of health stories has taken place in recent years.  The paper states that \\u201cwhile health and medical stories feature prominently in the news\\u201d, journalists are increasingly encouraged to take the path of least resistance, which has led to softer features and health coverage that centers on topics like \\u201cexercise and fitness\\u201d (Schwitzer 11).  More recent proof of low interest in covering healthcare came in the summer of 2009, when MSNBC host, Dylan Ratigan was reported to have called US healthcare \\u201c\\u201ebad for ratings\\u201d, a view further supported by chief Washington correspondent for CNBC and NY Times\\u201fs writer, John Harwood, who stated that healthcare is \\u201c\\u201enot only not a cable TV-friendly story; it\\u201fs not a journalism-friendly story\\u201f\\u201d (Lieberman, \\u201cHealth Reform Too Boring for Broadcast?\\u201d). Arguably, if the topic of US healthcare \\u2013 at a time when policy change had the potential for great consequence in America \\u2013 was unable to garner enough ratings, and ultimately attention from US journalists, foreign healthcare coverage was likely thin. Increased Shift towards Online News Coverage   The Internet also opened up the possibility for certain stories to be selected only for online publication, ultimately limiting the availability of published material further.  In a review of online healthcare coverage, it appears that new journalism forms (particularly blogs) do play an important role in educating the public about healthcare. A New York Times blog, entitled \\u201cPrescriptions: The Business of Health Care\\u201d, for example, was particularly useful at dispelling myths during America\\u201fs healthcare reform.  Other posts were dedicated to examining healthcare delivery in other countries. In \\u201cHealth Care Abroad: Canada\\u201d, for example, the journalist posted a Q&A she had with healthcare policy scholar, Ted Marmor, who provided an accurate description of Canadian 54  Medicare, indicating the benefits and fallbacks of such a system, as well as details of how Americans could stand to gain from looking north of the border (Arnquist).  However, as cited earlier, research conducted by Gary Schwitzer for the Kaiser Family Foundation illustrates that health news does not receive as much prominence online as it does in more traditional journalism platforms (\\u201cThe State of Health Journalism in the US\\u201d 16).  As a result of this development, \\u201cwhile insiders and highly motivated news users may be more able to seek out detailed news on blogs or cable news segments, the more casual news consumers may end up less informed in the years ahead\\u201d (16). 6.1.2 Political Influence  Changes to the political landscape of America that occurred during this study\\u201fs timeframe may have also influenced the amount of media attention afforded to Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems. President Obama and US Healthcare Reform   Overall, the small amount of media coverage of Canadian and UK healthcare may be a sign that healthcare policy in America has matured as of late.  Several years ago, Ted Marmor noted the decline in American interest in Canada\\u201fs healthcare system.  He states that while \\u201cconsiderable support has been expressed at various times for versions of national health insurance modeled on Medicare, the Canadian national health insurance program\\u201d, \\u201c[support] is less so in 2008 than in either the early 1970s or the period leading up to the Clinton reform struggle of 1993-4\\u201d (\\u201cAmerican Health Care Policy and Politics\\u201d 5).  A 2009 report by the Commonwealth Fund supports Marmor\\u201fs viewpoint, and notes that while, \\u201cin the past, discussion often focused on the merits or deficiencies of single-payer social insurance models, such as Canadian or French approaches, or public systems\\u201d, \\u201cmore recently, attention has turned 55  to countries that combine universal coverage with private insurance and regulated market competition\\u201d (Leu et al. vii). As of late, healthcare systems in Switzerland and the Netherlands garnered particular attention \\u201cfor their use of individual mandates combined with public oversight of insurance markets\\u201d (vii).  Examples of media mirroring this shift already exist.  In 2007, an article published by The New York Times centered on the fact that \\u201cthe Swiss and Dutch health care systems are suddenly all the rage in the United States\\u201d (Harris).  The early denial of rumors that single-payer healthcare systems would serve as models of US health reform by Obama and the leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives stands as continued evidence of maturing healthcare policy in America.  At a press conference in August, 2009, Obama stated: \\u201cThe Canadian model works for Canada. It would not work for the United States, in part, simply because we have evolved differently.  We have an employer based system, and a private based system\\u2026so we\\u201fve got to develop a uniquely American approach to this problem\\u201d (\\u201cObama: Canada Not a Boogeyman\\u201d).  Other Democrats, like Senator Max Baucus, also made it clear that a single-payer insurance model for the US was off the table: \\u201c\\u201eMost Americans want to reform our system...We have to work together to find out a better solution, which is still a uniquely American solution, which is public and private. We\\u201fre not, you know, Great Britain. We\\u201fre not Canada. We\\u201fre not the Netherlands. We\\u201fre American\\u201f\\u201d (Pear and Herszenhorn).  The early framing of healthcare reform (as moving away from single-payer models) likely impacted media coverage of US healthcare reform, and may have led to an overall lowered interest and representation of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare system in American newspapers. 56   More Coverage of UK - Special Relationship with US  The greater representation of the NHS compared to Medicare in US newspaper coverage can also be examined by looking at external factors, such as US military alliances.  In 2003, as a result of British support for America\\u201fs invasion of Iraq, the US/UK \\u201cspecial relationship\\u201d was likely reinforced, and strengthened.  A 2010 parliamentary report on global security by the UK\\u201fs Foreign Affairs Committee makes reference to the close cooperation between the UK and US in Afghanistan and Iraq in the years following 2001, and states that \\u201c\\u201ewars and conflict tend to emphasize the vitality of the relationship\\u201f\\u201d (qtd. in UK House of Commons 71).  It is possible that American media\\u201fs overall coverage of the UK has been influenced by this event and that greater representation of UK healthcare, over Medicare, in American newspapers reflects an overall trend towards increased US interest in many aspects of British life that have taken place more recently as a result of political war ties. 6.2 Reasonably Accurate Reporting 6.2.1 Online Access to Research Databases  As the World Wide Web continues to evolve and grow, there has been an explosion of online Canadian research databases dedicated to maintaining up-to-date information on the state of Medicare \\u2013 including research on wait times, primary care, and the future of Canada\\u201fs national pharmaceutical strategy.  The Health Council of Canada, the Canadian Institute for Heath Information, and the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) are just some of the bodies that currently have websites that provide accurate and up-to-date information on the state of Canada\\u201fs healthcare system.  In the UK, the availability of on-line healthcare information is also growing.  NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (formerly the National Library for Health) and the King\\u201fs Fund, an independent charitable organisation in the 57  UK, are just two examples of initiatives that provide online access to current research and health policy analysis in the UK.  The proliferation of online resources, combined with reporters\\u201f increased reliance on and preference for obtaining data from the web, were likely contributors to the relatively accurate level of coverage of Canadian and UK healthcare systems in US newspapers. 6.3 Prominent Coverage Themes  In \\u201cMetaphor and Health Policy\\u201d (2004), Nancy Lee pointed out that \\u201cAmerican analysts working for the expansion of healthcare insurance [in the US] face a contemporary political and cultural environment that is basically unreceptive to redistributive social policies that involve raising taxes and expanding the regulatory presence of government, twin fears that all but tune out the moral argument for the expansion of public health insurance to all Americans\\u201d (19). America\\u201fs long-standing interest in and hesitancy towards government control re-emerged under President Obama\\u201fs push for US healthcare reform and was reflected in the dominance of certain themes in American newspaper coverage of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems, such as government rationing and problems associated with paying for universal healthcare.  American media interest in the UK\\u201fs National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was also likely influenced by changes that took place to the US healthcare agenda under Obama. In February, 2009, shortly after being inaugurated, the President signed a bill for $1.1 billion for comparative-effectiveness research for drugs, medical devices, and surgery methods in America (Pear, \\u201cUS to Compare Medical Treatments\\u201d).  It is probable that this move resulted in greater US media interest in the NHS, a system which has relied on comparative-effectiveness research for over a decade.  However, and of particular consequence to US healthcare reform, this study found that American media coverage of NICE was oftentimes unbalanced.  No references, for 58  example, were made to the fact that many Americans face barriers to accessing care.  In the US, care is rationed on the basis of ability-to-pay, instead of scientific evaluation (as it is in the UK). As Jae Kennedy and Steve Morgan note, \\u201csophisticated diagnostic and surgical treatment are widely available [in the US], but access to these services depends on insurance coverage\\u201d, and, as a result, a large portion of the American population remains vulnerable (698-699). Essentially, the contrasting portrayal of rationed healthcare treatment and services in the UK with the medical options available in the US misconstrues the reality of the complex nature of healthcare administration and coverage in both countries. 59   7 Conclusion  As this study reveals, three of America\\u201fs most widely circulated newspapers, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, dedicated more space to coverage of the NHS than Medicare, a system that received less coverage between 2008 and the first quarter of 2010 compared to Rosenau\\u201fs study timeframe.  However, overall, US reporting of both Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems was relatively accurate, balanced, and complete.  It is suggested that the prominence and treatment of certain themes, like wait times and rationing, may have reinforced stereotypes of universal healthcare, which could have inhibited US reception to cross-cultural healthcare learning during a major shift in US healthcare policy. America\\u201fs rather simplistic, and often negative portrayal of the UK\\u201fs rationing body, NICE, arguably serves as a case in point.  In conclusion, the economic and practical pressures facing journalists today present barriers to more nuanced reporting.  Yet, the growth of new journalism platforms, particularly online blogs, are proving worthy substitutes for coverage and in-depth analysis of the foreign healthcare experience.  Finally, with reporters\\u201f increased reliance on online healthcare research databases, it is anticipated that future improvements in the accuracy of American reporting of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems will take place. 60   8 Limitations  This study was subject to a number of limitations relating to scope, content analysis protocols, database constraints, and sample size.  These limitations are discussed in greater detail in the following sections. 8.1 Rosenau\\u2019s Limitations Left Unaddressed  While this study expanded upon the work of Rosenau, it was subject to the same practical limitations as her (or any) study, primarily that \\u201cresults cannot be generalized to all other U.S. newspapers\\u201d, but are limited to the publications analyzed \\u201cfor the period of time sampled\\u201d (Rosenau, \\u201cU.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System\\u201d 46).  Furthermore, the scope of this study was limited to US coverage and so, like Rosenau\\u2019s study, didn\\u2019t address the subject of whether \\u201cU.S. newspaper coverage is better or worse than Canadian [and UK] newspaper coverage\\u201d (46). 8.2 Nature of Content Analysis  The limitations of content analysis as a research method are well known.  In \\u201cSynthesising qualitative and quantitative evidence: a review of possible methods\\u201d, scholars note that content analysis \\u201cis inherently reductive and tends to diminish complexity and context\\u201d (Dixon-Woods et al. 50).  Furthermore, they note, \\u201cfrequency-counting may fail to reflect the structure or importance of the underlying phenomenon\\u201d (50).  In other words, overemphasis on trends that emerge as a result of quantitative analysis may simplify the level of detail actually present in coverage.  With respect to this study, great efforts were made to prevent generalized 61  conclusions about US newspaper coverage of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems on the basis of quantitative results alone. 8.3 Database Shortfalls  While the tools of the digital age, including sophisticated content databases and search engines undoubtedly benefit the efficiency of the research process, sole reliance on these tools may also pose some limitations and potential risks in the interpretation of results.  The potential shortfalls of this approach were amply demonstrated during the research phase of this thesis while gathering information via Factiva.  Using the same search terms and criteria, the number of available articles was found to reduce over time.  ProQuest, the publishing company which owns Factiva, confirmed that they normally find that content available on the database increases over time as new articles are published and appended to the dataset.  However, they noted that content may fluctuate and dramatically drop at certain periods of time, as a result of contractual changes or expirations with publishers.  In other words, conducted at a different time, this study may have resulted in greater (or fewer) articles found, and slight variance in results and overall conclusions in US newspaper coverage of Canada and the UK\\u2019s healthcare systems.  The implication, in a broader context, is that the integrity of academic research can be compromised by database content dynamics that are fundamentally driven by business protocols between database providers and publishers, which probably, at least in part, reflect the profit motive. 10   This is a potentially significant limitation and risk, which researchers need to be aware of and strive to mitigate.  10  It is assumed but has not been validated, that these limitations also apply to other database content providers since they are subject to the same business constraints. 62  8.4 Inclusion Parameters  Rosenau\\u201fs constraint on article length, focusing on articles of 500 words or more, was maintained in this thesis to foster reliable quantitative comparisons.  While Rosenau\\u201fs justification for limiting the length of articles to 500 words is valid, it is important to recognize that this word count criterion seems rather arbitrary and is relatively restrictive and that shorter news stories can also be significant in forming public opinion.  For this study, a number of news articles that may have provided key insights into US coverage were excluded from analysis simply because they were below the 500 word cut-off. 8.5  Small Sample Size Sample size is an important consideration in quantitative and statistical analysis.  Within reason, larger samples tend to contribute to more reliable and confident interpretation.  The relatively small sample size referenced in this study imposes some limitations on the verity of the interpretations or at least the confidence of those interpretations.  This is particularly true of discussions related to Medicare where the sample size was limited to only six articles; less true of the NHS, where a larger sample size (22 articles) was involved. 63   9 Suggestions for Further Research  Investigation into the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and balance of domestic coverage of Canadian and UK healthcare would be particularly insightful, providing a measure for assessing the true quality of American coverage of foreign healthcare systems.  Furthermore, it would be illuminating to compare the results of this study to a content analysis of US newspaper coverage of other foreign healthcare models, such as the Swiss or Dutch healthcare systems, which are more reliant on private insurance.  Such models are arguably more relevant to the US healthcare policy context, and thus, it would be interesting to research whether American media coverage, as a result, is any more accurate than coverage of publically-financed healthcare systems.  In addition, with the shrinking size of newspapers and the emergence of new journalism platforms, a worthy endeavour for future research could involve an analysis of the tenor of shorter print news articles (i.e.: less than 500 words) as well as online US coverage of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems.  Furthermore, it could be expected that with the advent of staff cutbacks and the acceleration of online journalism during this study\\u201fs time frame, reporters were met by increased time and editorial pressures, trends that have led some to question what the impact will be on the quality of health journalism (Schwitzer 8).  Therefore, a study, involving interviews with journalists and editors, would provide greater insight into how industry norms and shifting practices directly influenced US coverage of Canada and the UK\\u201fs healthcare systems.  Reader surveys could also be conducted to help establish the larger societal impact of media coverage in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.  In brief, a study examining whether the prominence and popularity of certain story lines actually led to reinforced 64  stereotypes of Medicare and the NHS would reveal the greater influence of American newspaper coverage on public opinion during the period of US healthcare reform. 65   Bibliography Alberts, Sheldon. \\u201cObama\\u201fs plan to set up government-run health insurance drops into legislative  limbo.\\u201d The Vancouver Sun. 9 Sept. 2009. 15 Oct. 2009  <http://www.vancouversun.com/cars/Obama+plan+government+health+insurance+drops  +into+legislative+limbo/1974536/story.html>.

You know, many of the newcomers to Toronto come from areas of the world where newspaper readership is very healthy, and the press is booming, so why aren\\u201ft they reading your paper? Well, because\\u2026they were being treated like foreigners and ignored and stereotyped and they felt angry about it. So why would you give your business or spend your time with an institution that makes you angry?  \\u2014Interview with John Miller, former editor at The Toronto Star   and Ryerson professor emeritus   Angry and resentful responses from readers\\u2014most of whom were Canadians of Asian descent\\u2014were what resulted in reaction to a provocative story published by Maclean\\u2019s Magazine in November 2010. The article,  \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d, implied that the increasing number of Asian students in Canadian and American universities is a cause for alarm because, supposedly, white students cannot compete with too many \\u201chardworking, high-achieving, humourless Asians who never have any fun\\u201d (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). Condemned also by the city councils of Vancouver, Toronto and Victoria, the article was problematic in more ways than can be fully deconstructed in this paper. However, what will be discussed here is the fact that, despite the magazine\\u201fs claim that it was merely examining Canadian university admissions processes, and that the article was never meant to be racist in nature,  \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d was saturated with harmful racial stereotypes that depicted Asian-Canadians as threats to dominant white-Canadian society (Yu, 2010). 1.1 Rationale  As a Canadian journalist of Chinese descent, the racist and inflammatory nature of \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d upset me immensely and the article inspired me to examine how journalists can be trained to cover ethno-racial minorities accurately. Specifically, this thesis will examine what Canadian journalism schools could do to educate a critical mass of new journalists that reporting 2  on non-white Canadians must go beyond racialization\\u2014that is, the social process by which certain groups of people are assigned particular characteristics based on a constructed, \\u201cinferiorized\\u201d racial identity (Henry & Tator, 2002). This is because Canada\\u201fs urban centres have outgrown the common sense language used to describe the country\\u201fs contemporary cultural reality. For example, second- and third-generation descendents of immigrants, foreign-born Canadians who moved to Canada at a young age, and the offspring of mixed-race couples possess such complex cultural experiences that to associate them simply with one particular race or to categorize them as a \\u201cperson of colour\\u201d is entirely too generalized (Habacon, 2007). Moreover, the extensive shift in immigration patterns and policies over the last 25 years has transformed the face of major Canadian metropolitan regions so profoundly that using the term \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d1 to describe non-white Canadians no longer makes sense. Statistics Canada has reported that by 2031, Canada\\u201fs foreign-born population will rise from 20 per cent in 2006 to 25 to 28 percent, and the vast majority of them will be settling into big cities. By 2031, what are now considered visible minorities will make up 63 per cent of Toronto\\u201fs population and 59 per cent of Vancouver\\u201fs, with the lion\\u201fs share of these non-whites being of Asian heritage. Therefore, as John Miller, an interview participant in this study, suggested in the earlier quotation, the changing demographics of Canada could mean that unless Canadian news industries produce coverage about non-white Canadians that is perceived as accurate and fair by those same people, they will look elsewhere for information.  Despite this reality, structural bias still manifests itself in the media in the sense that biased framing of racialized minorities is seen as a professional norm and need not be disputed.  1  Statistics Canada uses the Employment Equity Act definition of visible minority, which is \\\"persons, other than Aboriginal Peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.\\\" This includes Chinese, South Asians, blacks, Arabs, West Asians, Filipinos, Southeast Asians, Latin Americans, Japanese and Koreans. 3  Non-white Canadians are still treated as minorities in mainstream media because they are often excluded (Mahtani, 2001; Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2002). Moreover, as is the case with \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d, they are misrepresented when they are associated with stereotypes that portray them as the \\u201cother.\\u201d Racial stereotyping in the media becomes even more controversial when taking into account the ways digital media has changed the global media landscape. In a time when globalized processes and the rise of social media means that audiences around the world have more access to a wider array of news sources than ever before, the need for accurate and fair cross-cultural and cross-religious reporting has never been greater. Even though researchers and critical journalists have exposed the continued stereotypical portrayal of racialized minorities in Canadian mainstream media through content analyses of newspapers and radio and TV programs (Mahtani, 2001, 2008; Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2002; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Stack, 2010) little research has been conducted in Canada on the role of journalism education in tackling racialization even though Canadian postsecondary institutions play an important role in educating future journalists. There is no doubt that digital media is rapidly changing journalists\\u201f role as gatekeepers of information. Consumers concerned with racist coverage can now resort to outlets outside of mainstream media if they find that mainstream media is not reliable or accurate. However, people who subscribe to racist perspectives in the media, and who may share or link to sites that contain such views, can still amplify their influence. Thus, in order to overcome stereotype-based coverage, journalism educators must emphasize early on in students\\u201f career the importance of challenging media bias when reporting on a culturally diverse society. As they do so, they must also examine the day-to- day challenges of running such a course and the emotional experiences that instructors and 4  students face when forced to confront their own biases and value systems while discussing racism in the media. 1.2 Research Method and Questions  This qualitative study will analyze an undergraduate journalism course taught at Ryerson University called \\u201cCritical Issues in Journalism\\u201d (formerly known as \\u201cCovering Diversity\\u201d). Introduced in 1997, \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d was the first writing and criticism course of its kind in Canada to focus solely on teaching students how to cover race and religion. In recent years, the course has evolved so that covering diversity now includes covering racial and gender and sexuality diversity, and that diversity component is one of many topics that are taught throughout the course. Through interviews with three of the course\\u201fs instructors, including the creator of the course, this thesis will explore the following questions: 1. How do the emotions of instructors, students and faculty staff come into play when implementing this course? 2. What changes were made to the course since its initiation, and what influenced these changes? 3. How might this case study be of use to the UBC Graduate School of Journalism, a school that wants to better prepare its students to report on diversity? 1.3 Terminology  I use the terms \\u201cwhite\\u201d and \\u201cnon-white,\\u201d \\u201cracial minorities,\\u201d \\u201cracialized minorities\\u201d and \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d often in this thesis. By \\u201cwhite,\\u201d I do not mean people of exclusive European descent or refer strictly to the colour of their skin. Instead, I use the term \\u201cwhite\\u201d in a political sense, referring to the group in Canadian society that defines its culture as dominant and the norm, while people of different colours are seen to be inferior. 5  I understand that the phrases \\u201cracial minorities\\u201d and \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d are problematic. As many non-white Canadians, such as Chinese-Canadians, can no longer be considered numerically as a visible minority in cities such as Vancouver and Toronto, to call them \\u201cracial minorities\\u201d is inaccurate. Similarly, to call anyone who appears to be non-white a \\u201cracial minority\\u201d is also questionable because appearances alone do not necessarily reflect a person\\u201fs racial identity.  Furthermore, significant economic, political and social distinctions exist among racial minorities. More importantly, continuing to use the term \\u201cracial minority\\u201d can further entrench marginalization because those who are classified under that term are seen as the \\u201cother.\\u201d Therefore, a more suitable term may be \\u201cracialized minorities,\\u201d because it captures the fact that those who are categorized as such are only constructed as such. Nonetheless, in the following literature review and in subsequent sections where interviewees or course documents are quoted, the term \\u201cracial minority\\u201d or \\u201creligious minorities\\u201d will be used because such terms were employed. These terms were used by participants in a generalized way to refer to people who have been subjected to differential or unequal treatment because of their physical characteristics, including but not limited to Chinese, Arabs, Jewish, Korean, Indians and Latin Americans. Similarly, interviewees also used the term \\u201cdiversity\\u201d in a loose sense to refer to diversity in race, religion, gender and disability.  6  2  Theoretical Framework and Literature Review  This section establishes the theoretical framework that was used in the analysis and interpretation in this study. The first section is a synthesis of literature about structural bias as it pertains to representation and narrative framing of racialized minorities in mainstream media. The second section includes literature that analyzes the prevalence of biased framing of racialized minorities. The third section of literature focuses on increasing awareness of racial bias in mainstream media through the changing of journalistic practices and journalism education. 2.1   Problematizing Minorities in Mainstream Press  Media scholars have long debated the degree to which the press perpetuates racial bias. In writing about the treatment of topics related to ethnic minorities in the press in the 1980s, Tuen van Dijk (1991) argued that mainstream media do not address the problems of minorities; instead they define minorities as the problem. Van Dijk stated that minorities are often associated with a number of stereotypical topics, such as immigration problems, crime, and violence, whereas their dealings with topics such as politics, social affairs and culture are under-reported (1991).   In Canada, a significant body of critical literature (Mahtani, 2001, 2008, 2009; Henry & Tator, 2002, 2003; Fleras & Kunz, 2001) also maintains that Canadian mainstream media often construct a distorted reflection of minority groups through the use of stereotypes and biased framing, which in turn portrays ethno-racial communities as those who pose a threat to dominant culture. According to this body of literature, what appears in media reporting is insufficient for gaining a complete and accurate understanding of ethno-racial communities due to patterns of misrepresentation that are reinforced by \\u2015slanted or stereotypical representations in media coverage\\u2016 (Hier, 2008, p. 132). Such coverage narrowly represents the complexity of ethno- 7  racial minority achievements because minorities are often grouped into \\u2015model\\u2016 or \\u2015problematic\\u2016 people, with little room for the coverage of differences within the community.  While sociologist Sean Hier does not dispute the findings of these studies of racism and the media, he argued in his research of race, ethnicity and media that such literature ignores the changes and progress that Canadian mainstream media has made in promoting ethno-racial harmony, acceptance and incorporation in the country (2008). For example, he argued that in recent years, primetime television shows have increasingly casted visible minorities as characters with influential occupational or social positions (2008). Moreover, news stories that seem to \\u2015other\\u2016 racialized groups\\u2014such as a 2006 article from the Globe and Mail that highlighted a family of black Canadian sisters who, despite the white privilege of Ivy League schools, earned degrees in Harvard University\\u2014can actually be seen as positive affirmations that mainstream media is highlighting the positive achievements of racial minorities and showing readers that racism in Canada is unacceptable (Hier, 2008).  On the other hand, media critics such as Minelle Mahtani, Frances Henry and Carol Tator (2008) maintain that discourses that marginalize and misrepresent racialized minorities are still pervasive in mainstream media in a way that may not always be apparent. They offered the example of a 1999 Globe and Mail story about a Parliamentarian accused of sexual assault by a Native woman. The story was situated in a Native reserve, and the reserve was described in the first four paragraphs of the article as a place where residents lived \\u2015crammed into log shacks\\u2016 and \\u2015made do without running water or telephones\\u2016 (qtd. in Mahtani et al., 2008, p.123). Even though the case was about an alleged sexual assault, Mahtani et al. point out that the focus was on the hardships in the Native community where the accused was stationed, thus reinforcing the stereotypical notions that Native Canadians generally lived in poverty and technological 8  backwardness (2008). Evidently, the framing of this story was skewed towards making the Native residents seem like degenerate human beings in order to draw sympathy towards a privileged government official whose crime would have been intolerable had he not been stationed at such a seemingly dreadful reserve. 2.2   The Prevalence of Biased Framing: Why Misrepresentation and Underrepresentation of Racialized Minorities Continue to Exist The prevalence of biased framing can be attributed to several reasons. In an essay that drew upon his own experience as a black reporter working for white-only mainstream media and reporting on urban violence in 1960s New Jersey, Austin Long-Scott (2004) argued that the reason stories involving issues of race, class and gender are often swamped by stereotypes (in his case, African-Americans are violent criminals) is because of the way journalism is structured. First, Long-Scott argued that the ability to tell a compelling story is more highly rewarded than the ability to question common assumptions of popular culture (2004). Moreover, the deadline structure of journalism promotes speed and brevity at the expense of in-depth understanding. As a result, as Walter Lippmann also observed in Public Opinion, journalists tend to oversimplify and fall back on familiar explanations and stereotypes rather than explore complexity (2007). Stereotypes, Lippmann said, are a \\u2015standardized mental picture held in common by members of a group and representing an oversimplified opinion, affective attitude, or uncritical judgment\\u2016 (2007, p.7). He argued that stereotyping results from the media\\u2018s need to quickly convey information about characters and to instill in audiences expectations about characters\\u2018 actions (2007). Similarly, Fleras and Kunz (2001) argue that media stereotyping is intrinsic to an industry that is constructed around simplifying information for audiences. Due to the limited time and 9  space in both print and electronic news, the mainstream media are rarely in a position to develop complex interpretations of reality that capture various human emotions, conflict or contradiction (Fleras & Kunz, 2001). In much of Canadian corporate media, stereotyping of racialized minorities tends to be negative. The Maclean\\u2019s article, \\u2015Too Asian?\\u2016 provides a case in point. In the story, Asian-Canadian university students are depicted as being overly hardworking and studious, as well as anti-social and cited as the reason why white-Canadians cannot compete for spots (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). Newscasting in Canadian corporate media still frames racialized minorities as people who are a problem, creates problems or pose a threat, either as vulnerable victims, indifferent members of society, or criminals (Fleras & Kunz, 2001). On the other end of the spectrum, Fleras and Kunz (2001) also argue that positive coverage tends to ornamentalize minorities and cast them in roles that are meant to amuse or embellish. Building on Edward Said\\u2018s concept of Orientalism (1978), they argue that news that focuses on the celebration of ethnic events and festivals, or emphasize racial minorities\\u2018 status as athletes or entertainers, serve to couple them with the exotic and sensual, and to depict them as \\u2015congenial hosts for faraway destinations\\u2016 (Fleras & Kunz, 2001, p.146). Rarely do racialized minorities just appear in mainstream media as average, normal, tax-paying Canadians doing average, normal things. However, Fleras and Kunz suggest that the tendency to frame minorities through stereotypical and even racist lens is not necessarily the individual reporter's intent. Rather, the problematizing of minorities by mainstream media is systemic and structural, not individual and attitudinal.  Newsrooms are sites of cultural production, and even though the news media tends to see themselves as objective, the selection of frames and particular narratives are often a \\u2015\\u2017preferred interpretation\\u2018 that reflects and reinforces the interests of those who control the news 10  process\\u2016 (Fleras & Kunz, 2001, p. 72). In turn, as Donald McCombs and Malcolm Shaw (1972) suggest in their agenda-setting model of media effects, what the media decides is news is what the public recognizes as news, and what is emphasized in the news\\u2014such as the criminal activity of certain members of a minority community, for example\\u2014is often perceived as what is important. Even when leaders of news organizations recognize the need to produce truthful and comprehensive accounts of ethnic minorities, it has been suggested that fair representation is impossible in mass media for several reasons. Again, Long-Scott (2004) pointed out that the market-driven decline in the numbers of journalists and news bureaus makes it harder for journalists to explore what\\u2018s really going on \\u2015out there,\\u2016 while the consolidation of news organizations into a small number of mega-corporations discourages variety in news coverage. The under-representation and misrepresentation of ethnic minorities could also be partly attributed to the cultural make-up of media workers. Journalists are largely bound by the dominant cultures within which they operate, and media workers often make decisions about stories, sources and images depending on their own understandings of audience composition and what the audience considers to be relevant (Mahtani, 2001). Mahtani has indicated that when the news staff and target audience are predominantly white, attempts to represent diverse cultural experiences can often be seen as too specific to be of general interest (2001). In the case of most Canadian newsrooms, John Miller has observed that those who take leadership roles, make news decisions, and shape opinions in mainstream media are predominantly white and middle-class. In 1994, he surveyed 41 daily newsrooms across Canada, and concluded that, \\u2015in both their staffing and in how they depict minorities in print, most of Canada\\u2018s dailies are nearly as white as the paper they\\u2018re printed on\\u2016 (Miller, 1994, para. 5). 11  Despite operating at a time when the communities they cover are increasingly diverse, Miller suggested these workers are less able or inclined to access, understand and explain the experiences of non-white elites, thus they produce coverage with blind spots (1994). 2.3   Diversifying the Newsroom  James Watson (2003) advocated that fairer, non-stereotypical and non-racist treatment of ethnic minorities in mainstream media can be achieved by more representation among those who report and present events in the news, for \\u2015until representatives of ethnic minorities become media moguls themselves,\\u2016 they will continue to be misrepresented (Watson, 2003, p.199). Similarly, Miller (2004) also suggested that a change in leadership and diversification of newsroom staff could lead to more sensitive and accurate coverage. However, his 2004 survey\\u2014 a follow-up to the one he conducted in 1994\\u2014of 37 Canadian newsrooms indicated that the commitment of editors to hire diversity is generally low (Miller, 2004, Discussion and Conclusions, para. 1). While many editors claimed they had a \\u2015very strong\\u2016 desire to hire diverse staff, most explained the low numbers of visible minorities in their newsrooms with, \\u2015People of different races just do not apply here\\u2016 and \\u2015The journalism schools don\\u2018t supply them\\u2016 (Miller, 2004, Findings and Analysis, para. 5). Rather than taking steps to attract minority candidates through recruitment at journalism schools or ethnic publications, Miller pointed to how surveyed editors were shifting responsibility to minority journalists rather than taking steps to diversify the newsroom (Miller, 2004, Findings and Analysis, para.5) Without sources or reporters in minority neighbourhoods, news organizations cannot obtain accurate understanding of their different interests and grievances. On the other hand, even in instances where racialized journalists (those who identify as members of minority racial groups) exist in mainstream newsrooms, they may refrain from 12  criticizing even when they witness the production of stereotypical representation (Mahtani, 2009). Between 2005 and 2008, Mahtani conducted interviews with racialized journalists in Toronto and Vancouver, who revealed that they felt images of minority groups were misleading. One journalist of Filipino descent pointed out that \\u201598 per cent of Muslim stories have nothing to do with Muslim men praying, but we always use that same image,\\u2016 and that contemporary images of Muslim women doing everyday things such as picking up their children and going grocery shopping never gets portrayed in mainstream media (Mahtani, 2009, p. 262). Despite their frustration, though, the study\\u2018s findings revealed that many racialized journalists felt they had to \\u2015sit back and swallow it, for fear of being too \\u2017politically correct\\u2018 or a loudmouth,\\u2016 or for being seen as a troublemaker who got the job because of affirmative hiring policies (Mahtani, 2009, p. 274).  In addition, Mahtani\\u2018s study revealed that some ethnic minority media workers are uncomfortable with being seen as spokespeople for their particular group, and with being perceived by their colleagues as biased (2009). The issue is further complicated by the varied viewpoints within cultural and racial communities. Minority groups can be divided in terms of how they identify themselves, with proponents on different sides arguing for integration and assimilation, or for cultural separation and authenticity. Mahtani (2009) argued that \\u2015racialized silences\\u2016 are one of the reasons why the underrepresentation or misrepresentation of racial minorities continues to be produced and tolerated. But one cannot assume that, should racialized journalists not fear being reprimanded for criticizing stereotypical depictions in the media, they would automatically produce news that is accurate and representative of everyone from their respective communities, or that they won\\u2018t buy into stereotypes as well. For example, a racialized journalist who is a second or third- generation Canadian may not be able to identify with new immigrants from the same ethnic or 13  cultural background. Even those new immigrants within that community could differ from each other immensely. As a result, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1990) warns against essentialist representation of minority communities, for diasporic cultures can be quite different from the culture they came from originally. Therefore, to group together all members\\u2014including journalists\\u2014of the same racial background and to assume that they would be able to relate to one another is also stereotypical. 2.4   Denial of Systemic Discrimination  Finally, the misrepresentation of racial minorities, particularly the framing of them as \\u2015problem people\\u2016 in Canadian media, can be seen as the manifestation of racial prejudices and racism in everyday discourse and news coverage (Hier & Greenberg, 2002). Through their research, Henry and Tator (2002) demonstrated that there remains a persistent denial of systemic racism, which is \\u2015deeply manifest in the fabric of Canadian culture and is a part of all social, economic and political systems\\u2016 (p.36). In addition, they claim that the denial of racism among opinions makers is \\u2015so habitual that making the allegation of racism and raising the possibility of its influence on social outcomes becomes a serious social infraction\\u2016(Henry & Tator, 2002, p.37). As a result, those who work in the media are frequently unaware of their role in contributing to racism, and often they resist criticism of their own practices. 2.5   Overcoming Structural Bias in the News  Despite the difficulties of overcoming inaccurate and oversimplified media portrayals of racial minorities, some media scholars maintain that it can be done. Writing in the 1920s, Lippmann (2007) criticized the American public for basing their public opinions on stereotypes, which are \\u2015representations of the unseen facts\\u2016 (p.85). As such, he argued that rather than relying on the press to tell the public what the truth is, the public, or an independent, expert organization, 14  must overcome the stereotypes and expose the unseen facts behind them. Some of Lippmann\\u2018s vision can now be seen through the rise of citizen media, where the public is forcing itself into the conversation. For example, days after the Maclean\\u2019s article, \\u2015Too Asian?\\u2016 was published, a website titled, \\u2015Too Asian and Damn Proud of It!\\u2016 was immediately established. According to the \\u2015About\\u2016 section, the website is meant to provide a forum for Asian-Canadians to \\u2015respond and tell these ignorant white folk what it really means to be Asian\\u2016 (2010). Thanks to citizen journalism and social media, journalists who claim to know what citizens care about may now quickly find out they are wrong (Kovach & Rosentiel, 2003). Like Lippmann, Todd Gitlin (2003) also challenges journalists, students of mass media and marginalized groups to challenge and transform the political and economic elite definitions of reality. Rather than accepting definitions of newsworthiness from editors, Gitlin suggests that journalists should develop their own positions about what to cover, though he did not necessarily provide strategies for how a journalist working in a mainstream news outlet might do this. Nadyat El-Gawley, a freelance radio producer based in Sydney, Australia, has challenged the way local and national media has reported, listened to, and understood issues of race and ethnicity in Australian society. El-Gawley makes radio documentaries and features based on stories that ethnic minorities tell her about migration, life in the suburbs, racism and their encounters with the media (El-Gawley & O\\u2018Donnell, 2009). In an interview with Penny O\\u2018Connell (2009), professor of international media and journalism at the University of Sydney, El-Gawley confessed that her toughest audience is usually other journalists and executive producers who are often out of touch with the non-white communities they are reporting on. Instead, as Long-Scott has also pointed out, these journalists assume experts can explain the behaviour and needs of racial minorities better than they can explain themselves. In addition, El- 15  Gawley pointed out that the widespread belief that being impartial and objective, and presenting \\u2015both sides\\u2016 of a story would automatically lead to the achievement of equality and fair, accurate and balanced reporting actually silences crucial perspectives in complex issues of diversity (El- Gawley & O\\u2018Donnell, 2009, p.519). Through her radio programs, El-Gawley invites audiences to listen to people they may be afraid of, feel uncomfortable about, or have no interest in (El-Gawley & O\\u2018Donnell, 2009). Referring to a story she once did in Bankstown, a suburb in Sydney where many Lebanese- Australians live, she observed that tensions in Bankstown towards the media is apparent because \\u2015whenever the words \\u2017Lebanese\\u2018 and Bankstown\\u2018 were mentioned in the news, an immediate association was made with crime\\u2016 ( El-Gawley and O\\u2018Donnell, 2009, p.522). In response, people from that community treated journalists with hostility, thus reinforcing the notion that Bankstown people are generally aggressive. To counter this cycle, El-Gawley (2009) argued that journalists must discard the myth of objectivity and instead, spend time to engage and negotiate with the minority communities on which they are reporting, show respect for their customs, and allow them to review the interview transcripts. This way, not only will members of the minority group be able to correct any inaccurate portrayals, but they will also feel more confident in giving journalists their stories in the future. El-Gawley emphasized that, despite the deadline-driven structure of daily news, spending time to engage with the community that a journalist is reporting on is crucial to unlearn stereotypes and produce fair and accurate coverage. In The Authentic Voice, a book on best practices in reporting on race and ethnicity, Star Tribune writer Allie Shah (2006) furthered El- Gawley\\u2018s point by noting not only the importance of writing from a community (instead of just about it), but also the importance of research. In 2000, Shah wrote a news article on Somali 16  teenage girls trying to reconcile their conservative cultural and religious mores with the more permissive society within which they lived in the United States. Even though Shah, being a Muslim like most Somalis, said she had a \\u2015head start\\u2016 on the cultural background, she did not speak Somali or wear the hijab (p.17). Therefore, she approached her reporting by first reading and attending a crash course about Somali culture, history, religion and gender issues. She also went to Somali concerts and book readings, and she went to school, the mall and did everyday things with her sources.  The knowledge and immersion allowed Shah to earn the trust of many in the Somali community and to write with an authentic and authoritative voice. Similarly, KRON-TV producer Craig Franklin (2006) also advocated the necessity of research, source development, story production and personal growth in order to unlearn racism and develop stories about race that are accurate, fair and balanced. As a white journalist producing a series that examined the way people handled race relations in the United States, Franklin argued that all journalists must first, regardless of their skin colour and despite the discomfort, confront their ignorance about people from racial backgrounds different from their own, and question their own biases and the rules of objective journalism (2006). Only then will they be able to appreciate and understand the complexities of race relations, and to search for ways to frame those complexities into stories that would make sense to viewers and readers. At the industry level, another way to stop the sensationalized and biased reporting on matters of race and ethnicity is to \\u2015mainstream diversity\\u2016\\u2014that is, to institutionalize a more positive and realistic portrayal of minority men and women into a news organization (Fleras & Kunz, 2001, p.164).  Fleras and Kunz argue that a simple incorporation of minority men and women into the newsroom is not enough. Rather, newsroom practices must proactively and positively engage with diversity as different, yet equal, and to promote differences as necessary, 17  normal, and beneficial without ignoring the need to address disadvantages that minorities confront (2001). Some progress towards internal reform has been evident in Canada. Since August 2001, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has required that broadcasters submit corporate plans for cultural diversity that include initiatives designed to achieve these goals (\\u2015Cultural Diversity on Television\\u2016, 2003). Such initiatives include commitments to corporate accountability, the reflection of diversity in programming, and the solicitation of effective feedback from viewers (\\u2015Cultural Diversity on Television\\u2016, 2003). To date, the CBC, for example, has implemented reforms including sensitivity training for program and production staff, language guidelines to reduce stereotypes, the monitoring of on-air representation of racial minorities and the hiring of journalists from different racial backgrounds. 2.6   The Role of Journalism Education in Unlearning Racial Stereotypes  Another fundamental method to better represent ethnic and racial minorities in the media is improved journalism education, which is the focus of this study. In 2008, representatives from various US journalism and mass communications schools who had been successful in implementing a particular program that contributed to diversity on campus came together to discuss how these programs were organized and executed, and the challenges that they faced in implementation. The conference, organized by the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University, provided recommendations about diversity as it relates to faculty, students, leadership and research.  In the conference\\u2018s report, Sally Lehrman, director and national diversity chair for the Society of Professional Journalists, noted that accurate and fair coverage has always been crucial to good journalism. By excluding different perspectives from different people in the community, she argued, what is being reported and what is being taught in many classrooms cannot be 18  considered accurate or fair (Lehrman, 2008). Without change, journalists are then reinforcing unconscious and reflexive \\u2015truths\\u2016 that are not true (Lehrman, 2008, p.12). Lehrman argued that understanding unconscious bias, structural racism and institutional bias is integral to every journalist and educator\\u2018s toolbox. However, \\u2015achieving academic diversity is like trying to move mountains\\u2016 because of a lack of time for talking about better practices and a lack of appreciation for diversity\\u2018s relevance to higher education (Lehrman, 2008, p.10). More problematic is the prevailing view that the inequities that journalists and educators are trying to address are over (p.10). As a result, the lack of diverse voices in the newsroom is linked to the lack of diversity in journalism education. The Maclean\\u2019s article, \\u2015Too Asian?\\u2016 previously cited, in which the generalizations of Asian-ness and whiteness are taken as truths, illustrates Lehrman\\u2018s point about the way journalists deny the existence of systemic inequality. The authors cite \\u2015hard data\\u2016 that indicates Asian students work harder, tend to be strivers, high achievers and single-minded in their approach to university, and are more likely to pick universities that specialize in math, science and business (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). By contrast, white students, the authors write, \\u2015are more likely to choose universities and build their school lives around social interaction, athletics and self-actualization and yes, alcohol\\u2016 (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). The authors, like many other journalists, appear to be unaware that what they are citing are stereotypes. Therefore, journalism educators must step in to teach journalists to counter such assumptions. Essed observes, \\u2015when\\u2026racism is transmitted in routine practices that seem \\u2017normal\\u2018, at least for the dominant group, this can only mean that racism is not often recognized, not acknowledged\\u2014let alone problematized by the dominant group\\u2016 (10). Again, the Maclean\\u2019s article illustrates this point.  The two students who were interviewed are convinced that not 19  selecting a university that is \\u2015too Asian,\\u2016 is not an issue of racism, but merely a matter of choice (Findlay & Kohner, 2008). Neither the two interviewees, who were given the pseudonyms Alexandra and Rachel, nor the authors appear to be aware that they are exhibiting structural bias. Such bias is what the Poynter Institute\\u2018s Keith Woods regards as the \\u2015unconscious, unexamined and rationalized stereotypes that masquerade as knowledge\\u2016 (Perry, 2008, p.125). Thus, it is up to the journalist to work against them and to \\u2015rise above fears of human difference so they can tell a story that is not merely voyeuristic, but unveils the universal truths within that difference\\u2016 (Perry, 2008). Arlene Morgan of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism offers a framework to do that, because \\u2015anyone who contemplates diversity education in a journalism classroom or newsroom must first examine the perspectives he or she brings to the profession before systemic issues that prevent an honest and authentic style of reporting can be mitigated\\u2016 (Morgan, 2008, p. 131).  First, Morgan indicates that a \\u2015safe\\u2016 haven for people to discuss uncomfortable issues surrounding diversity must be established so that they can speak their minds respectfully and not be reprimanded (2008, p.134). In Morgan\\u2018s book, The Authentic Voice (2006), co-author Alice Pifer recommended lesson plans that incorporate Robert C. Maynard\\u2018s Fault Lines theory. In the 1960s, Maynard, a former reporter, ombudsman, editorial writer and the first African American to own a mainstream American newspaper, identified five \\u2015Fault Lines\\u2016 that are essential to consider if journalists want to produce a story that accurately represents the entire community regardless of the issue: race (including ethnicity), gender (including sexual orientation), class, geography and age (Miller & Hsu, 2008). By asking students to apply the Fault Lines concepts when writing stories, they are forced to confront their own biases, and to realize who is being left out. However, Miller and Hsu argue that no list ever applies to every person, organization or 20  community at all times (2008). Each community has its own Fault Lines, and both journalists and teachers need to be aware of the issues, such as religion, political orientation and immigration, that are important locally and to apply them as they produce stories (Miller & Hsu, 2008). Morgan and Pifer (2006) also advocate that students be challenged to find sources or settings that are outside of their comfort zone so they can include a number of viewpoints and cultures. However, they point out that it is important not to presume that reporters of certain colours and ethnic backgrounds automatically know how to cover their communities. Furthermore, educators should integrate race and ethnicity coverage into the fundamental reporting and writing course by devoting one major segment to teaching diversity coverage, and invite experts, reporters and editors who are doing best-practice work to give guest lectures and help students conceptualize the importance of including context and voice to complex subjects. Bearing in mind this framework of racial bias in the mainstream press and the merits and challenges of incorporating race coverage into journalism education, the following sections will examine how one Canadian journalism school has tried to tackle race coverage through the course, \\u2015Critical Issues in Journalism.\\u2016  21  3  Course Introduction  In 1997, the Ryerson School of Journalism in Toronto introduced \\u201cCovering Diversity,\\u201d a mandatory undergraduate writing and criticism course created by John Miller, a former editor at a large Toronto daily newspaper. Its objective was to teach journalism students how to develop a strategy to fairly and accurately cover matters of race and religion, to frame stories about Toronto\\u201fs many racial communities in a manner that is non-stereotypical, to include stories both about achievements and conflicts within these communities, and to pitch racial diversity stories to the professional media (See Appendix A for course syllabus). Eventually, the course evolved both in name and content\\u2014it became \\u201cCritical Issues in Journalism,\\u201d and no longer focused solely on racial diversity coverage. Instead, \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d encompassed several things: beat reporting; covering racial minorities, people with disabilities and gay and lesbien people; and critical analysis of controversial issues in mainstream media, such as democracy, cultures of impunity, foreign correspondence, media ownership and citizen journalism. The course is also no longer compulsory. Most recently taught by Joy Luk 2  and a co- teacher in the winter term of 2010, and Kali Ma 3  in the fall term of 2010, \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d aimed to teach students to question journalistic practices that may fall short of core journalistic values such as fairness, accuracy and context, and to identify pitfalls in their own reporting (See Appendix B and Appendix C for course syllabi). Throughout the rest of this paper, this course will be referred to as \\u201cCritical Issues.\\u201d  2  Note: a pseudonym chosen by the interview participant is used here. 3  Note: a pseudonym chosen by the interview participant is used here. 22  3.1   Significance of the Course  As a former editor of the Toronto Star, Miller said he realized only after he left the paper just how much stereotyping is part of news judgment. As soon as you get assigned a story, you immediately start limiting it. You generally say, \\u201cOh it\\u201fs one of those stories.\\u201d That limits who you talk to, it limits your perspective on the story and unless you learn to delay framing a story, then you\\u201fll never get to the real story, and that needs a lot of attention (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  All three interview participants agreed that \\u201cgetting to the real story,\\u201d particularly when it concerns minority communities, requires getting past clich\\u00e9s. Instead, journalism students need to first understand why stereotyping of minorities exist, why it is problematic, and most importantly, when they becoming practicing journalists, how to ensure their stories reflect the reality and nuances of these communities.    3.1.1   Confronting Structural Bias  The curriculum of \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d was initially based upon research on diversity coverage that Miller had conducted on behalf of the Canadian Daily Newspaper Association. It was also influenced by the problematic coverage of a random robbery in 1994\\u2014a case that was brought up again in the Toronto Star this January. Seventeen years ago, three young black men robbed a trendy midtown caf\\u00e9 in Toronto called Just Desserts, and shot a 23-year-old white female to death (Tyler, 2011). All of a sudden the papers were publishing grainy police surveillance camera shots that only showed the skin was black. You couldn\\u201ft make out any identifying features and the media just went off and said, \\u201cThis is US-style urban warfare come to Canada.\\u201d It was sort of a moral panic response. And I\\u201fd done a sort of an analysis on that media coverage and I said, \\u201cYou know, this can\\u201ft go on. We\\u201fve got to make our coverage more sophisticated than this\\u201d (Miller, personal communications, January 21, 2011).  As a result, he decided that students needed to learn skills on how to cover cross-cultural and cross-religious issues. Thus, Miller developed and taught the first \\u201cCritical issues\\u201d course at 23  Ryerson. Subsequent instructor, Luk, argued that such skills are necessary because racism and systemic discrimination in Canadian mainstream media continues to persist in newer and subtler forms\\u2014often in a seemingly innocent way. As a result, it is important that instructors train journalists of the future to tackle editorial decisions that may lead to biased or inaccurate storytelling.  It is important because [racism] is so insidious. Of course people don\\u201ft do the overt stuff. You don\\u201ft\\u2014you can\\u201ft be overtly racist in your coverage, but where we\\u201fre at right now, I think in Canada, is the subtle stuff is not questioned (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Referring to the Maclean\\u2019s article, \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d, where Asian-Canadian university students were labeled as being smart, but socially awkward (Findley & Kohler, 2010), Luk said: The problem with any kind of racial stereotype is it can flip any way. I mean, of course it\\u201fs better to be called smart than dumb, because some minorities are considered to be dumb, so it\\u201fs nice to be considered smart, except it\\u201fs still a stereotype and it hurts people. And also, it\\u201fs another way of making you the \\u201eother.\\u201f You\\u201fre not part of the mainstream, you\\u201fre the \\u201eother,\\u201f you\\u201fre the people who are smart, who aren\\u201ft any fun and you\\u201fre taking our spots (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Ma also agreed that racism in the mainstream media could be quite inferential. You can have somebody who is a very nice person, who is a good journalist, a good professional journalist, a good editor, but still falls into the pitfalls of creating or allowing an article like \\u201eToo Asian?\\u201f in Maclean\\u2019s to go through (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Here, both Luk and Ma point to institutional bias and the process of \\u201cothering\\u201d in mainstream media. Fleras and Kunz (2001) argued that in Canada, a country that is widely seen to be socially progressive, racist concepts have shifted from an emphasis on discriminatory laws and deliberate exclusion to an emphasis on covert expressions that are embedded in institutions such as the media. For example, negative or resentful comments about a particular racialized group may not be seen as racist, but merely a genuine reflection of ignorance, fear or bad manners on the part of the speaker. Hence, why the authors and sources in \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d could easily claim the term, 24  \\u201cToo Asian\\u201d is not about racism, only that \\u201cmany white students simply believe that competing with Asians\\u2014both Asian Canadians and international students\\u2014requires a sacrifice of time and freedom they\\u201fre not willing to make\\u201d (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). In this example, it is clear that both Luk and Ma sympathize with the authors of \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d and imagine that it was never their intent to offend people. When such is the case, Ma emphasized the importance of getting students to critically examine the socialization of themselves, to identify their own points of privilege, and to understand how their identities influence their reporting, for biased coverage does not occur in a vacuum. Instead, they are a result of many different societal processes that rationalize stereotypes and misconceptions. By discussing these processes throughout her course, such as the factors that influence an editor\\u201fs decision to leave some stories in while others out, the implications for news coverage when media chains dominate a region, the depiction of racial minorities and the coverage of the gay, lesbian and trans-gendered communities in corporate media, Ma said students can develop a holistic understanding of how biased coverage is created, and how to make an argument for change. You\\u201fre only asking them to think about it, and you\\u201fre also asking them to understand that in the classroom, some people are right\\u2014extreme right, some people are racist, some people are extreme left, and the idea that will be the same in the newsroom. And that hopefully, you can have a debate that is intelligent and informed and have a way to sort of respond to an editor\\u2014you know, have a way to walk in and have some ammunition, that if you are somebody who wants to help to build a more progressive media, then how do you start to articulate that (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  Luk pointed out that the course can only go so far, though. While instructors can point out the blind spots of media coverage and can try to help students avoid falling into those same traps, at the end, the most important lesson students need to learn about covering minority issues is that it is not easy. As they go out into different communities to scoop out stories and interview 25  people for an assignment, they will most likely meet resistance from the community they are covering, and failure, Luk said. I think it makes students stop and think a lot when they\\u201fre dealing with real people who are going to be sensitive about something, or angry about something. This is the best way to learn, is to get thrown into a tough story. And the good thing is, of course, is it\\u201fs a class assignment so if they make a big mistake, they\\u201fre not going to get fired from their job or the newspaper isn\\u201ft going to be investigated by the press council (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).     3.1.2   Making Stories Relevant to the Community is Good Business  As Miller\\u201fs quote from the introduction indicated, reflecting your community accurately is simply a part of good journalism. He and Luk both argued that if Canadian media does not catch up with demographic realities, the industry may soon go out of business.  26  4  Facing Discomfort, Hostility and Disappointment: The Role of Emotions in Implementing This Course Structural bias is prevalent not only in newsrooms, but in classrooms and education institutions as well (Stack, 2010). Miller acknowledged that when it comes to talking about race and religion, there tends to be \\u201carmed camps\\u201d because the conversation forces people to question societal norms, their identity, their privilege and biases. The discomfort could lead to hostility. Thus, for some of the \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d instructors, challenging this bias within the classroom and the faculty has been an emotional struggle. Certainly, most jobs require people to manage their emotions in some way, such as holding back anger at a boss, overcoming fear of presenting in front of clients, or swallowing hurtful comments or criticism from colleagues (Harlow, 2003). For the \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d instructors, teaching a course about race and the media often involved managing frustration, anger, anxiety, a sense of isolation and hurt. Miller experienced overt resistance from students and faculty staff from the get-go. As a result, his experience served as a cautionary tale for following instructors such as Luk and Ma. Neither of them was directly involved in confrontations with other faculty members and students, but both instructors felt that teaching this course comes with baggage and as a result, they had to tweak the curriculum to accommodate. 4.1   Confronting Angry Students  Miller realized early on from his students\\u201f exaggerated body language\\u2014jumping over things and slamming doors\\u2014that they were not comfortable with talking about issues of race and privilege, and they tended not to relate this discussion to journalism. He noted that many white students felt the course was aimed to make them feel guilty for being white, while non-white 27  students resented being singled out when all they wanted was to fit in with Canadian society. Other times, Miller was accused of trying to be \\u201cpolitically correct\\u201d for teaching students to write certain stories just to appease a group that is left out of mainstream media coverage. He was also resented for being \\u201ca white guy trying to be a black guy,\\u201d while Ma, on the other hand, who is a relatively young instructor of colour, was seen as having some kind of special interest in teaching about racial bias. She struggled to get past students\\u201f defensiveness when they felt that she was challenging their sense of privilege and entitlement. If there\\u2018s nobody else who looks like me at the school of journalism, and everybody else is 55 plus and is white and has grey hair, then when they see me at the front of the classroom, then I don\\u2018t seem like an authority figure. So that\\u2018s problematic to begin with. They have an easier time challenging me, for example, so the way that students speak to me is different (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  For instance, Ma said she has had students speak to her in disrespectful tones during lectures. While it was hurtful, she shrugged it off as, \\u201cIt is the way it is.\\u201d My students feel comfortable enough to challenge me, which I think is good, but comfortable enough to challenge me in a non-respectful way is a different thing\\u2026 But I also\\u2014I mean, it is the way it is\\u2014their point of privilege, they think they can speak to me that way\\u2026Students do get defensive and they do feel a sense of entitlement and privilege because they are entitled and privileges in society in general (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Ma noted, for example, that getting her students to complete one major class assignment was an exasperating experience. They really pushed back on it at first and refused to work with each other as she had requested. Other times, they questioned her knowledge and the validity of her lecture material, claiming that they \\u201cknew all about it\\u201d and did not learn anything new from her course. As a result, Ma felt she had to make an extra effort to appear authoritative and qualified. For example, when students asked for deadline extensions, she always said no because she felt she had to \\u201cmaintain a level of authority that others may not.\\u201d 28  Other times, students confronted the instructors outright. Luk noted her co-teacher had a student say to her face that she was a terrible teacher\\u2014an incident that caused her co-teacher to be rather distressed. When Miller brought in a guest speaker from the Canadian Islamic Congress, students accused him of hosting anti-Semitic and intolerant people. He also noted that sometimes, their anger would overcome them. This was evident during the years when he gave students a final exam, and some students wrote provocative answers in response to an article filled with problematic stereotypes just to protest against the course. However, the most shocking experience for Miller occurred during his first year of teaching \\u201cCritical Issues,\\u201d when the students\\u201f hostility translated into a petition that was sent to the chair of the program to abolish the class altogether. I said, \\u201cJeez, good thing I have tenure because if I didn\\u201ft, I\\u201fd be totally intimidated.\\u201d The normal first reaction if students don\\u201ft like a class or teacher or way of teaching is to take it up in class, you know? Or come in and say, \\u201cI\\u201fm having real trouble with the way you\\u201fre teaching the class.\\u201d But to abolish the class, right off the bat\\u2014that just doesn't happen (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  The course remained part of the journalism program at Ryerson, but as a result of this petition, Miller said he tweaked the course slightly in order to address some of his students\\u201f grievances about topics and assignments. However, he maintained that the \\u201copposition was quite there\\u201d until he retired. 4.2   Showdown with Faculty Members  Another unique experience for Miller alone was faculty opposition to his course. Again, he had anticipated that not every teacher in the journalism program would agree with a course focused solely on covering diversity. It would be the first of its kind to be taught in a Canadian journalism school, and many teachers simply said that the course was not necessary, and were quite impartial. However, this indifference turned into a confrontation when one year, one of 29  Miller\\u201fs students did a content analysis for an assignment, and chose The Ryerson Review of Journalism, a magazine produced by students and an instructor at the School of Journalism.  This student examined the magazine\\u201fs covers over an extended period of time and concluded that the covers did not portray racial diversity because only photos of white people were ever published on the covers. The student then presented the analysis to the Review\\u201fs instructor and asked for an explanation. According to Miller, the instructor replied, \\u201cWell, there\\u201fs research that shows that, you know, if you put a person who\\u201fs black on the cover of a magazine, it doesn\\u201ft sell as well.\\u201d  Aggravated, Miller then encouraged his student to challenge that assumption. He had wanted this instructor to produce evidence that supports this claim, but this example also indicates his determination to challenge the kind of racist thinking that seemed so entrenched in his faculty. However, it caused the Review\\u201fs instructor and others who taught magazine-writing to \\u201cone-by-one gang up\\u201d on him during a curriculum review.  They said\\u2014they quoted from my student\\u201fs paper, and they said, \\u201cThis is just\\u2014this is just bullshit because we\\u201fve written stories on diversity. How can you teach a course like this?\\u201d It shocked everybody, you know, that they would gang up so publicly on a student\\u201fs work and a fellow faculty member\\u201fs course. If that is allowed to happen in a faculty, it has an effect. It becomes a controversial course, it becomes not\\u2014you know, it becomes a course that nobody wants to teach. If they want to teach or they\\u201fre assigned to teach it, they\\u201fll probably change it (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  To Miller\\u201fs disappointment, that in fact happened. When it was time for him to pass on the course, his successors declined his offer of lecture notes and research material and instead, rearranged the course curriculum. He lamented the loss of his original course and attributed the circumstances to lack of interest and support within the faculty. You only have so much energy. One person on a faculty only has so many oars they can put in the water and change things. This course actually grew out of my research and my thinking in teaching the course to an initially hostile audience over seven or eight years\\u2026And so all that was lost and it\\u2018s really no surprise that the course changed 30  drastically after that...if nobody was interested in knowing what the course was based on in the first place (Miller, personal communication, February 21, 2011).  Ma was one of the subsequent instructors who revamped the course, particularly after she was told that students had reacted poorly the previous term because her predecessors had been too assertive about the existence of racism and sexism in the media. Ma was also too aware of how her identity as a female professor of colour could influence the way students perceive her. She had refused to teach this class when it was offered to her several years ago, partly because she had been the only person of colour in the School of Journalism then. She did not want to be the token professor to teach diversity issues because \\u201cstudents tend to get very defensive when learning about things like\\u2014when you try to teach something that is either anti-racist or feminist.\\u201d Ma indicated that she has tried to express this problem to fellow professors, but many do not understand her dilemma because they cannot relate. Her experience sheds light on the existence of institutionalized bias within the school of journalism. On the one hand, as a professor of colour, she was essentialized as the expert on \\u2015diversity issues\\u2016 and was expected to be the one who can teach students all there is to know about how to cover different racial and cultural groups in a fair and accurate way. On the other hand, she understood that even if she did possess such knowledge, given that she is a visible minority in the journalism school, students may perceive her to be threatening if she teaches about power and privilege in mainstream media, and about how students\\u2018 sense of privilege can affect their reporting. 4.3   Factoring Student and Faculty Reactions into Curriculum Decisions: Taking the Path of Least Resistance Given the tension and emotional strain, Miller generalized that teaching this course can produce anxiety, particularly for untenured professors and professors of colour. As a result, they 31  may choose to change the course in order to meet less opposition. Ma appeared to have done as such when she revised the curriculum in 2010. Rather than focus only on diversity (which, in her case, included racial, religious and gender diversity) she also included concepts like journalism\\u201fs role in democracy, cultures of impunity, corporate consolidation of news and the role of social media (see Appendix C for syllabus). The idea, she said, was to start with universal concepts with which students all agree, and about which they will be less likely to get defensive\\u2014such as the idea that a journalist should not be killed for speaking out against an oppressive government. Only after students have built a consensus, about halfway through the term, did they explore more controversial topics such as covering race and gender diversity. Despite the course changes, instructors did not necessarily have any easier of a time teaching it. Luk said her predecessor got \\u201cvery depressed teaching it\\u201d and \\u201ceverybody hated it, and everybody seemed to want to get out of it.\\u201d She also said that when she contacted previous instructors for information, they gave her a shocked, \\u201cOh my God, you\\u201fre teaching that?\\u201d Miller also admitted wearily that he \\u201cwent through a lot,\\u201d teaching this course: When there were troubles in the course, my teaching ratings went way down because people were angry. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy\\u2014there was this shared feeling among students that, you know, there was a problem course and therefore they better rate it pretty lowly. Now I have a pretty thick skin and it wasn\\u201ft going to affect my employment but I just said, \\u201cGod help it if an untenured professor gets this course because they\\u201fre going to run the other way,\\u201d and that in fact is just what happened (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  Evidently, teaching such a course was not simply about implementing a curriculum with a particular agenda to teach students how to overcome racial bias in their own reporting. Rather, the instructors realized that trying to change students\\u201f minds about certain issues was very difficult. For example, Luk indicated that a lot of her students insisted they do not see much sexism in the media, therefore they do not understand the problem. Nonetheless, both Luk and 32  Ma agreed that some skepticism was healthy because it stimulated discussion and pushed students to explore an issue and question general assumptions rather than to just take certain journalistic practices for granted.  The point, Ma argued, was not for students to necessarily agree with the instructor\\u201fs point of view or with each other, but to inform students about controversial issues related to mainstream media so they can draw their own questions and conclusions. You leave everything as a question and therefore students are able to make their own conclusions. If you walk away still thinking, \\u201eWell I think it\\u201fs perfectly fine\\u201f\\u2014I mean, you\\u201fre not going to change everybody\\u201fs minds (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Miller, however, was quite disappointed. For one thing, the course that he had set out to establish no longer exists in its original form because it has been \\u201cerased from the collective culture of the School of Journalism.\\u201d For another, he lamented, \\u201cThe [students] who decided that it was bullshit, they probably didn\\u201ft learn very much. We failed them.\\u201d Furthermore, the course forced instructors to question their own biases and their own reasons for teaching such a course\\u2014something that often put them in an awkward position and caused them to feel exasperated. Miller, who is a middle-aged white male, said students rated his course poorly, with comments such as, \\u201cIt\\u201fs such a lousy course because Miller is a white guy who wants to be a black guy.\\u201d But I was always conscious and I said, \\u201cLook, you know, I can\\u201ft teach this course as a guilty white guy, and I certainly don\\u201ft feel like a guilty white guy, that\\u201fs not where I\\u201fm coming from.\\u201d And so I always had to make it clear why I was coming to this course, and when I chose teaching assistants I tried to have racial diversity in them so that you know, we\\u201fd be presenting different perspectives (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).   However, it was never as simple as that, because when instructors are too passionate about topics related to their own background and expertise, they can end up being biased as well. 33  Luk, who is also a female professor of colour, said she never experienced any kind of negativity from students regarding her race and gender. However, she was conscious that her personal experience influenced the way she taught. For example, because she had experienced depression herself, she insisted that the ignorance of mainstream media when it comes to reporting on people with illnesses like schizophrenia must be addressed in class so that students do not fall into stereotypes and end up promoting prejudice in their stories. You have to be objective. You cannot be an advocate, really\\u2026you\\u201fre still a journalist. You have to see the weaknesses and problems with coverage that is biased, but, I mean, you can swing around the other way and be biased yourself, be pro-women or pro- Chinese, so that\\u201fs the danger (Luk, personal Communication, January 27, 2011).  It is apparent then, that teaching a course such as \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d is not merely about the mechanics of devising a course curriculum, assigning readings and case studies and marking assignments. Rather, instructors must take into account the kind of emotions such a course will rile up in students, the influence of faculty politics, as well as their own emotions and biases. All of these things will affect how the course is taught, and whether it will be taught effectively.  34  5  From Being Ghettoized to Being Holistic: Course Changes over the Years \\u201cCritical Issues,\\u201d last taught by Ma in 2010, is now designed to expose students to a myriad of controversial issues that challenge the role of journalists, but the course was not always set up that way. As previously noted, the course changed over the years as different instructors took over.  Instructors adapted the curriculum according to their own interests or expertise, but this chapter will examine how Miller, Luk and Ma also changed the curriculum in response to student and faculty reactions, as well as out of faculty obligations. 5.1   Curriculum Changes  As previously noted, the curriculum of \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d was originally based on Miller\\u201fs research in problematic coverage of racialized minorities in mainstream media and his strong belief that journalists needed to learn skills on how to accurately cover cross-cultural and cross- religious issues. At first, it was a mandatory course because Miller wanted to reach every student in the journalism program. Due to student resentment, however, the class became an elective instead. Miller\\u201fs focus has always been on racism in Canadian mainstream media. Therefore, each week, students would look at topics such as racial and religious stereotyping in the media, racial profiling, and covering differences within ethnic communities. Case studies were also assigned to get small group discussions going and stimulate students to think of questions that may arise. While Luk\\u201fs course was structured in a similar way, her curriculum was a mixture of teaching students beat reporting and critical issues in journalism. She and her co-instructor picked twelve different topics to teach over the course of the term, and the topics were categorized under \\u201cCovering Diversity,\\u201d \\u201cBeats/Genres,\\u201d and \\u201cOther Issues\\u201d (See Appendix B). Under \\u201cCovering Diversity,\\u201d Luk and her co-teacher focused on race, gender and physical and 35  mental disabilities\\u2014the first and last of which are topics Luk is passionate about. However, Luk said the curriculum was structured this way only because she had inherited the syllabus from a previous teacher, and she and her co-teacher felt obligated to follow it. In Luk\\u201fs opinion, jumping around every week to a different topic was problematic because some of the topics, such as citizen journalism, had little to do with other topics such as sports reporting. More importantly, she argued that this \\u201cone-issue-a-week garbage\\u201d was too superficial because there was little time to cover each topic as in-depth as she would have liked. It is for this reason that Miller designed the original \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d to be a 13-week course focused solely on covering racial and religious diversity. He argued that students needed to be given adequate time to get their heads around race and religion, but the concepts that they learn should enable them to cover other issues such as gender and sexuality diversity. Ma disagreed. Even though she conceded that it is difficult to comprehensively cover each of the 13 topics in her syllabus, she believes taking this holistic approach allows students to draw connections between topics such as democracy, press freedoms, media ownership, race and ideology, and digital challenges to journalism. For example, by looking at corporate consolidation of media, students learn that this could mean fewer independent voices, which could result in biased coverage. This way, Ma said, students will obtain a bigger picture of how things like socialization, global and local flows of ideas and cultures, power and identity politics can affect how they approach and report on a certain community. Through this awareness, students can then become more conscious journalists and will not fall into the pitfalls of stereotyping and misrepresentation. Moreover, she said, students will learn that axes of identity, such as race, gender, class and sexual orientation do not occur in a vacuum. In fact, they intersect with each other, and such 36  intersections can be apparent in any beat, including sports and fashion. In her class, Ma integrated sports reporting into a discussion about racism by offering the example of Ben Johnson, and how he was identified by mainstream media as a \\u201cCanadian Olympic gold medalist,\\u201d and then as a \\u201cJamaican from Scarborough\\u201d when he was stripped of his gold medal. 5.2   From Being Ghettoized to Being Holistic  Ma added that covering racial diversity is important, but she saw Miller\\u201fs original curriculum as simply a course that taught students to survey the city\\u201fs ethnicities, to report on communities with which they are not familiar, and to be sensitive to various religions and communities. She argued that if the course was structured this way, students will develop essentialized views of communities rather than an understanding of the social and historical context that shape such communities, and how the power and privilege of certain people can influence media coverage of others who are traditionally marginalized. Teaching somebody about Gerrard Street and Little India does not teach them about racism, or, you know, systemic discrimination issues. It simply teaches them there\\u201fs a South Asian community in Toronto and what their issues might be. It has some value but it\\u201fs not\\u2014to me it\\u201fs not critical thinking and it\\u201fs not anti-racist thinking, doesn\\u201ft look at it from a sociological perspective at all (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Here, Miller defended his original conceptualization of the course, claiming that the aim was always to get students to be critical of some of the bad habits, such as stereotyping, that journalists resort to when reporting on race and religion. He also emphasized the importance of the civic mapping assignment in getting students to recognize that many communities, white or otherwise, are not monolithic. For this assignment, students were required to go into a community they knew nothing about, and where they were a visible minority and seen as an outsider. The goal was for students to find out \\u201cwho\\u201fs who\\u201d and \\u201cwhat\\u201fs what,\\u201d in that community, and to find under-reported stories about these communities. Through this 37  assignment, students were also able to find out whether factions existed within the community they\\u201fre mapping, and how these differences were defined.  And they could be the difference between Canadian-born Chinese and Hong Kong-born Chinese. There [are] cultural divides that are quite\\u2014 they play out in what people wear, you know, where they hang out (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  Nonetheless, Ma\\u201fs criticism is worth noting because, as Mahtani (2008) has concluded, reporting on \\u201cfluffy\\u201d pieces such as the celebration of ethnic events and festivals is not any less problematic than coverage that associates certain racialized groups with crime and violence. Mahtani argued that such \\u201clight coverage\\u201d only promotes \\u201cstaged ethnic representations,\\u201d where the highlighting of different food, family and personal and religious practices are seen as a snapshot of cultures when in fact, each individual culture is fluid and varied (p.652). 5.3   From a Separate Diversity Course to Incorporating Diversity into the Curriculum As stated earlier, another significant change to the course since its introduction is that the diversity component now includes gender diversity and covering people with physical and mental disabilities in addition to racial diversity. In addition, several weeks of the term rather than the entire term is devoted to teaching the diversity component. Again, for Luk, this was simply the curriculum she had inherited, and for Ma, it was a conscious decision to change the course content. However, Ma said she also did it out of obligation to her faculty chair (\\u201cIt\\u201fs very difficult to say no to your chair who asked you personally to teach a course\\u201d), who had decided to revise the journalism curriculum. The faculty chair, she said, had felt that Miller\\u201fs original course was a \\u201cghettoized idea of covering diversity,\\u201d and instead, they wanted something that was more post-modern, more rooted in critical thinking and theory, and that was woven throughout the entire program and curriculum. 38     5.3.1  Importance of Driving Diversity into Journalism\\u2019s DNA  In Ma\\u201fs opinion, embedding a diversity component in not only \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d, but in every journalism course in the program is much better than just having a course singled out as, \\u201cThis is the class we talk about race in the media or diversity.\\u201d She argued that race permeates all kinds of issues covered by the media, and all instructors should be encouraged to integrate this component into their teaching. Both Miller and Luk agreed. In fact, Miller said \\u201dCritical Issues\\u201d was created as a separate course originally only because the issue of race was not being approached in other reporting classes. The long term plan was to you know, get it to the point where the students in that course were really breaking good stories that were getting published and show to the rest of the school this should be an element of all reporting classes. Eventually it was going to be part of other courses, but it never got to that point. There was hostility or indifference on the part of the rest of the faculty and looking back, I probably could have done a better job to sell it to the rest of the faculty (Miller, personal communication, February 21, 2011).  Luk added that because most journalism schools in Canada draw their instructors from a pool of journalists who are mostly white, middle-aged men, many are not partial to the idea, or even competent or knowledgeable enough to incorporate a discussion of racial diversity into their teaching. The reality is that unless you\\u201fre consciously\\u2014as an instructor, unless you\\u201fre consciously considering the diversity aspect of an issue, it\\u201fs going to be gone, it\\u201fs going to be lost. And I think that\\u201fs the problem with newsrooms, is that they don\\u201ft consciously think about this. That\\u201fs why we get all the mental illness stories about white people, that\\u201fs why we get business stories mainly about white people (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).  Here, Luk reflected upon the same conclusion that Mahtani (2001) did. Journalists are largely bound by the dominant cultures within which they operate. Therefore, their story ideas, and their choices of framing, sources, quotes and images are influenced by their own socialization, personal experiences and understanding of the world around them (Mahtani, 2001). 39  As Luk pointed out, when news staff are predominantly white, then their experience with or knowledge of cultural experiences different from their own can be limited. Given this reality, Luk concluded that even though it would be most ideal to have the diversity component permeate entire courses in a journalism school, she does not believe the majority of journalism teachers in Canada have reached that point yet. As a result, she believes a separate course focused solely on diversity in race, gender and sex, and ability is necessary.  40  6  Setting an Example for Others: How this Case Study Can be of Use to the UBC Graduate School of Journalism The UBC Graduate School of Journalism recognizes that teaching meaningful diversity is a crucial determinant of excellence in education for students who will become practicing journalists in the future. As a result, the school has been actively recruiting more graduate students from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds and with diverse interests and specializations. It has also recently appointed a faculty member who is a member of the Tahltan Nation as assistant professor. The School has also previously hosted a guest speaker from CBC to speak about diversity initiatives in the CBC newsrooms, as well as members of the Asian- Canadian Journalist Association (ACJA). Furthermore, similar to Ma\\u201fs course syllabus, a diversity aspect has purposely been included in the school\\u201fs core journalism class, \\u201cIntegrated Journalism\\u201d and in the course, \\u201cMedia Ethics and Leadership,\\u201d where two of the 13 topics specifically look at \\u201cGender, Class, Justice\\u201d and \\u201cRace, Ethnicity and Indigeneity.\\u201d 6.1   Making Diversity an Even Higher Priority   This study suggests that there are ways in which teaching diversity coverage can be strengthened at the UBC J-School. Certainly, inclusivity is important in everything taught on a university campus. Therefore, it may appear to be more ideal to have courses that include a diversity element rather than a specific course on diversity, for if students are continually exposed to and educated about the importance of understanding race and culture, that insight may become a natural part of the journalism they produce. However, given that the problematization of racialized minorities is still so prominent in Canadian mainstream media today, it appears that learning to cover diversity well may require both a separate course on 41  diversity to develop in-depth understanding, and infusing diversity issues in the rest of the curriculum in a meaningful manner. Given that the UBC J-School is a graduate school, both instructors and students are expected to exhibit professional, respectful behaviour and demonstrate an aptitude for journalism. As a result, a separate course on covering diversity issues at the graduate level may be less likely to generate the kind of negative or defensive responses that were experienced at the undergraduate level, as was the case with Ryerson University. Moreover, if it was an elective rather than a compulsory course, instructors may be able to filter out those students who resent being in a class in which they have no interest. Nonetheless, instructors must be aware that topics such as race and gender are often difficult for anyone (including the instructor him/herself) to talk about. Therefore, whether the School establishes a separate course on diversity coverage or incorporates a diversity component into all courses, instructors must establish a safe environment for people to honestly express their feelings, or ask uncomfortable or awkward questions without fear of being reprimanded by their colleagues.  However, as Miller demonstrated, a separate course on diversity coverage affects not only students, but faculty members as well. Just as there is institutional bias in news organizations, the same exists among journalism schools. Thus, it is equally important for faculty to stand united behind this course, or at the very least, remain open-minded to the idea so that faculty politics will not affect the course\\u201fs impact on students. Therefore, all staff members must be fully committed to including this course into the journalism program and infusing a diversity aspect into their own individual courses. Moreover, the program must fully understand that the nature of the course content, as the Ryerson instructors have demonstrated, could generate low course evaluations from students. Thus, for a separate course to have impact, it may be necessary 42  to ensure that while instructors should accept constructive criticism from students and make improvements to their teaching, the evaluations would not count against their promotion or tenure.    6.1.1   Future Considerations   If the UBC J-School were to include such a course solely on covering diversity, then the faculty must think about the following: what kind of readings should be assigned? What kind of teaching strategies would they use? What does \\u201cdiversity\\u201d really mean? Who can teach this course, and what must the instructor be prepared for in order to teach it effectively?  And if the UBC J-School were to include a diversity component into all journalism courses instead, as they are doing currently, and want to further improve that aspect, then the faculty must think about the following: how can all instructors incorporate that component into their readings, assignments and class discussions? How must the instructor prepare in advance in order to teach this part of the course effectively?  And finally, regardless of which option the school chooses, faculty also need to think about the more practical and structural aspects of the course: when should this course be offered\\u2014during first or second year, first or second term? Should it be a mandatory course or an elective? Should it for only one term, or for two?  To offer some recommendations, the following sections will draw upon the experiences and advice of the three \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d professors. 6.2   Teaching the Course: Calling all Thick-Skinned but Intelligent and Insightful Teachers In previous sections, it became apparent that in order to teach students how to cover sensitive issues such as race, religion and gender, the instructor must acknowledge students\\u2019 43  feelings and realize that talking about individual biases can rile up feelings of resentment, guilt and even hurt. In addition, instructors must be aware of how their own emotions can come into play, especially when students directly challenge them. As Earnest L. Perry Jr., associate professor and chair of journalism studies at the Missouri School of Journalism wrote, \\u201cWhen done right, [teaching cross-cultural reporting] is hard not only for the students, but also for the instructor\\u201d because an effective instructor uses every opportunity to challenge students\\u2019 belief that they are \\u201cculturally sensitive\\u201d(Perry, 2006, p.3). As a result, students could feel offended and react by directly attacking the instructor\\u2019s teaching or character, as was the case with Miller, who noted that his ratemyprofessor.com student ratings included hurtful comments that called him judgmental, smug and hypocritical. However, he claimed he has \\u201ca pretty thick skin\\u201d\\u2014something that kept him from taking such negative comments personally and pushed him to remain open to students\\u2019 criticism. He gave the example of when a student asked about why gender and sexual diversity was not being given as much attention in the class. And one of the instructors said, \\u2015Well, because this is what\\u2018s important now. People are coming to terms with homosexuality and gay people and it\\u2018s not as\\u2014we\\u2018ve sort of solved that.\\u2016 And this person just went berzerk, and said, \\u2015We haven\\u2018t solved it.\\u2016 And so you had to be careful in the arguments, and it became easier to say you know, \\u2015That\\u2018s a very good point and we hope the course will develop that way, and what would that consist of (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011)?  Developing a \\u201cthick skin\\u201d against negative comments and rejection may be important, but so too is encouraging students to talk honestly about their feelings in order to alleviate tension is crucial. In addition to having extensive knowledge of the subject, bringing in teaching assistants and journalists from diverse backgrounds to share \\u201cauthentic\\u201d personal experiences and stories about how they are treated in the newsroom could expose students to new experiences. However, being an instructor of colour and teaching about journalism and diversity has a different type of emotional baggage. As stated earlier, Ma was very aware of the rarity of her 44  racial status in the academy, and she had feared teaching a course on diversity because she anticipated students would react negatively. She had also indicated a slight fatigue, when she described the way she had to negotiate the power dynamics within the classroom and faculty. The frustration arising from a racial and gender double standard\\u2014white male professors tend to automatically command students\\u201f respect while female professors of colour (especially younger ones) tend to have to work harder to earn it because students view them to be lacking experience and legitimacy (Harlow, 2003)\\u2014was not something her fellow professors in the journalism program or otherwise seemed to understand. Given Ma\\u201fs experience as an example, professors of colour teaching a course about race and the media may find that they have to manage both personal and professional emotions far more extensively than their white counterparts, and that they have to struggle harder to win a sense of control over their ability in the classroom (Harlow, 2003). Yet, like Miller said, having a diverse faculty is important. If journalism teachers are all white, then their experiences will probably be limited and this lack of insight can affect how well they teach this course. However, as Luk pointed out, having white instructors as the majority is inevitable because most schools are drawing teachers from a pool of journalists who are mostly white.  \\u201cCan a white person, can a white man teach this?\\u201d she mused. \\u201cProbably an intelligent white male can teach this, but you [have] got to be intelligent.\\u201d  An \\u201cintelligent,\\u201d teacher, then, must be observant and able to empathize and be sensitive to students\\u201f feelings. More importantly, they must be competent enough to teach both similarities and differences within a multicultural society. Otherwise, they will fall into the usual stereotypes.   45  6.3   Readings Selection  In selecting readings and case studies for the course, all three instructors said material that would provoke discussions and pose questions is most ideal.  Miller suggested that readings should cover a range of issues, such as racial stereotyping, limited sourcing, and the use of words and images that may misrepresent a particular minority group, while Ma said in more generalized terms that readings must bring students into a conversation about a particular topic in the course, and must help students articulate an opinion about a specific issue around journalism.  Luk insisted that readings must be current, journalistic articles as opposed to academic articles. For one, her students indicated they hated reading some of the academic journals that were assigned. For another, she believes \\u201cjournalism is to write journalism.\\u201d Students should not be \\u201cfussing around with these academic things\\u201d when they need to \\u201cgo out there and try to cover something involving blacks and find out how difficult it is,\\u201d she said. Because these issues are very problematic in the newsroom today, it\\u201fs very much a live problem and so if you\\u201fre training journalists for the future, it would be really great if they would tackle these things. And that\\u201fs why it should never be covered academically for a journalism school. Sociologists can do that. We\\u201fre journalism, we need to do the hands- on, nitty gritty\\u2014get your hands dirty and see how you\\u201fre going to fail when you have to cover a racial issue (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  By reading or watching news clippings that contained problematic stereotypes, Luk said students can see when stories were not \\u201cdone right,\\u201d and when an issue was complicated to cover. Consequently, they can brainstorm alternatives and discuss the possibility that there may not be a correct answer to how to cover particular issues. If a diversity element was incorporated into the entire journalism program, Ma suggests that instructors all examine their reading lists and see where they can incorporate more diverse points of views and where they can add stories produced by journalists who are not traditionally included. 46  6.4   Assignments  Assignments in \\u201cCritical Issues\\u201d aimed to sharpen students\\u2019 journalistic skills as well as to get students to check their own biases in terms of story framing and source selection. For example, Miller\\u201fs civic mapping assignment aimed to help students unlearn stereotypes and discover stories. Students would explore a chosen racial or religious minority community with which they are not familiar. Then they would present their findings to the class, such as the type of institutions and religions that are prevalent in that community, the authority figures, the prominent newspapers and television networks, and some of the issues with which the community is contending. Students were then required to submit a story that examines an issue that they discovered from the civic mapping assignment. Miller said this assignment is helpful because it encouraged students to pretend they are not a journalist. Instead, he told them to look at the community through the lens of an urban geographer wanting to find out more about a community. This strategy can help move students away from a, \\u201cI better have a story in mind\\u201d mindset before they even approach a community. Luk, on the other hand, said civic mapping was not helpful. She and her co-teacher also assigned it, but it differed slightly from Miller\\u201fs because students were required only to \\u201cpick a neighbourhood or a group and tell [the class] all about it,\\u201d and did not need to produce any stories afterwards. Evidently, the discrepancy between the two civic mapping assignments, in terms of the assignment itself and the outcomes, illustrate a problem with passing on the course. There was little coordination and communication between instructors and, as Luk demonstrated when she inherited the course, a tendency to reinvent the course each time it was passed on to someone new. 47  Miller concluded as much, especially when his successors did not accept his offer of course materials. They just said no, we\\u2018ve got our ideas for this class, and blah blah blah. Well to me that was short-sighted\\u2026 when the resources are there and the people are willing to help you and provide all the material you want, you know, why say no? That\\u2018s just dumb (Miller, personal communication, February 21, 2011).  Luk agreed, saying a lot of effort is wasted on figuring out what this course means when a new instructor reinvents the wheel each time. Nonetheless, she said that if she were to teach the course again, she would abolish the civic mapping assignment. Instead, she would get students to write three to four stories about a particular minority group, and throughout the term she would meet with students to discuss story angles and problems they are having. The first story could be a profile, so that students could establish contacts and story ideas, but by the third or fourth story, the story should touch on an issue that involves tension. I want something that\\u201fs uncomfortable. Something that\\u201fs uncomfortable to discuss, where it may not be any\\u2014where no one side is actually right, where the community is divided over it and quite vehement about it\\u2026I want them to do conflict stories because those are very difficult to do\\u2026I think for the students it\\u201fs more important for them to understand how touchy things are (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Ma, who believed civic mapping does not help students to think critically about their craft, assigned a talk show production plan instead. The talk show topic had to be related to any one of the 12 topics that were covered in class. Students were required to speak to sources in a particular group, such as queer youth, and to ask questions of sources about a specific issue with which queer youth may be dealing, such as high suicide rates. So it might mean calling up an editor, it might mean calling up a particular activist to discuss what the critical issue in journalism was at that time, which was, how is this topic covered and did this particular campaign have any impact (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  Ma said this exercise allowed students to get the type of hands-on reporting experience that they may not get in other classes. Here, they can obtain a different sensitivity to approaching 48  communities with which they are not familiar, and understand they can\\u201ft be \\u201ccalling things by the wrong name because people will turn off.\\u201d As well, through this assignment, students can learn the importance of using different angles and sources that may be missing from the mainstream press. I want them to be holistic about it and look at it at, you know, so what is the gay press covering? Who is the gay press leaving out? Is the gay press leaving out, you know, a particular segment of the population? Is the gay press leaving out people of colour (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  Luk agreed that this approach of considering different voices which can be incorporated into any story and any form of storytelling is ideal for if a diversity element is to be incorporated into all journalism courses. That means if you\\u201fre teaching feature writing, or magazine-length journalism, you want the story ideas to always consider that component, to always think about\\u2014it should be at the back of your mind. It shouldn\\u201ft be overt in every story, but you should always ask yourself the question, is there some way to be\\u2014make this more diverse, to reflect the population that you\\u201fre reporting on, and reflect the people, the audience or the readers who will be looking at that (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011)?     6.4.1   Evaluation  Miller and Luk realized early on that exams were not helpful. As this course can evoke strong emotions in students, Miller said students might let these feelings overcome them and purposely write provocative answers that would lead to a poor grade. Since at the graduate level, small group seminars are the norm rather than large class lectures, exams would seem unnecessary at the UBC J-School as well. After several years of teaching \\u201cCritical Issues,\\u201d and evaluating students, Miller developed a marking rubric for assignments and stories that may be helpful for UBC J-School professors, called the diversity scale. At the lowest level, Miller said, is \\u201cno diversity coverage,\\u201d where a student\\u201fs story is full of racial stereotyping, inaccurate information and limited sources. 49  At the next level is the \\u201csong and dance coverage,\\u201d where a story focuses on celebrating ethnic events and festivals. Then there is \\u201cunconscious diversity coverage,\\u201d where a story\\u201fs character just so happens to be from a particular racial or ethnic group, but the story\\u201fs topic is unrelated to that character\\u201fs racial identity. Finally, there is \\u201cconscious diversity coverage.\\u201d Through this scale, Miller said students could locate where they believe their journalistic work is at, and could then make improvements to achieve a higher level. Not only does Miller\\u201fs diversity scale demonstrate an understanding of how individual bias can affect one\\u201fs reporting, it also offers a method to access and overcome that bias, and to produce more sophisticated and analytical coverage of racialized minorities. Therefore, not only can it be adapted by journalism schools, it can also be of use to media industries as well to assess their own work. Here, Ma gave an industry example of the difference between what Miller calls \\u201csong and dance coverage,\\u201d and \\u201cconscious diversity coverage.\\u201d The Globe and Mail are like, \\u201cLet\\u201fs cover the different communities. Let\\u201fs do a story on Chinese New Year. We\\u201fll do a story on Chinese New Year or the Moon Festival and you know, go into Chinatown and see the dragon and see moon cakes and dim sum.\\u201d That\\u201fs a nice story, nothing wrong with that, but there\\u201fs nothing interesting about that necessarily either. It doesn\\u201ft\\u2014it\\u201fs not analyzing anything, for me, about Chinese people in Canada. The more interesting story for me is, can you do a story that looks at the history of\\u2026you know, the fact that white women were arrested for marrying Chinese men in the fifties? Can you look at something that talks about the Chinese head tax and see, you know, where the Chinese community is on that issue today (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  6.5   Teaching Strategies   To get students to understand the complexities behind different racial and minority groups, identify the problems behind stereotypical coverage, and produce stories that are more accurate is a daunting task. All three professors had to utilize various strategies to push students to confront their own biases, to engage them in discussions about the course material, and to produce in-depth and accurate stories. 50     6.5.1   Case Studies  Presenting case studies that did not meet the standards of fair and accurate coverage of racial minorities was a useful method to get class discussions going and to get students to think critically about the article. Miller and Luk found it helpful to first present a story that involves a particular racial minority, but to remove or change the racial identifiers or epithets. After students have discussed the story\\u2014often concluding with a, \\u201cWhat\\u201fs wrong with this?\\u201d\\u2014the professors would then insert the racial identifiers again. This exercise was meant to help students see that when racial minorities are incorporated into an otherwise acceptable story, the article can become discriminatory.  For example, Miller assigned a reading taken from Stormfront.org, a white supremacist website. The article, called \\u201cWhat is Racism?\\u201d argued that double standards are at work for white-Americans when it comes to racism: When a white man kills a black man and uses the word \\\"nigger\\\" while doing so, there is an enormous media uproar and the nation beats its collective breast; when members of the black Yahweh cult carry out ritual murders of random whites, the media are silent (see AR of March, 1991). College campuses forbid pejorative statements about non-whites as \\\"racist,\\\" but ignore scurrilous attacks on whites (Jackson). Miller took the \\u201cidentifying stuff\\u201d off, and had students discuss the article.  And when I thought the moment was right, I said, \\u201cWell, why did I find this at a white supremacist site?\\u201d And the whole class just\\u2014their mouths dropped opened, and so then we had to look at it again and said,  \\u201cWell\\u2026oh. I see. Yeah\\u201d (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).   Similarly, Luk said if she were to teach this course again, she would use the Maclean\\u2019s story, \\u201cToo Asian?\\u201d as teaching tool, where she would first present the original story, and then substitute all references to Asian-Canadians with Jewish people. Because I know there will be people in the class who would go, \\u201eWhat\\u201fs the problem? You\\u201fre being called smart.\\u201d But it\\u201fs always bad to be singled out as, you know, the Jews under Nazi Germany found out, if you had to wear a yellow star, it\\u201fs not a good thing. 51  With Asians of course, they\\u201fre visibly different, we\\u201fre talking about visible minorities (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Here it may be necessary to clarify once again that the term \\u201cvisible minority\\u201d used to describe Asians in Canada is relative to where they are situated in Canada. For example, to call many Asian-Canadians \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d in cities such as Vancouver and Toronto is misleading because percentage-wise, the population of Asian-Canadians is rapidly rising in relation to what would be considered the white majority in other parts of the nation. The term also implies inferiority. As a result, it may be necessary for instructors to encourage students to think critically about common sense but problematic language such as \\u201cvisible minority\\u201d, \\u201cperson of colour\\u201d, \\u201cracial minority\\u201d, and \\u201cperson with disability.\\u201d Also, students should also be encouraged to think about when and when not to use racial identifiers in a story. When applied to certain people out of context or relevancy, these identifiers further marginalize them as being different from or inferior to the mainstream. Certainly, instructors and students are not to be expected to come up with concrete alternatives. Nonetheless, discussing this issue could push students to think more carefully about how they can use language that is more representative when they produce stories.    6.5.2   Guest Speakers  Miller and Luk also found that bringing in working journalists who can speak passionately and articulate clearly about their work was another method to engage students in discussion and to ask questions. Guest speakers often have first-hand experiences that the instructors do not For example, Luk said students seemed most engaged when, during the week that she was teaching about covering people with disabilities, she brought in a CBC producer who uses a wheelchair. Since the producer had quite a personality\\u2014\\u201cShe came in and she was spitting mad 52  because she couldn\\u201ft even get into the building without going all around because there\\u201fs no wheelchair access,\\u201d said Luk\\u2014she was able to captivate the students, especially one who also used a wheelchair. The producer showed story clips about a Canadian soldier in Afghanistan who had lost one of his legs in a blast. She then talked about how he was immediately labeled by the media as a hero, but in her opinion, a better story would be to ask deeper questions about any kind of trauma this soldier might be suffering from, or why he decided to stay in Afghanistan still. Anyway, she launched this discussion and I think because I had a real-life example, a person coming in who was a journalist and because she brought a clip that showed how one-dimensional this was\\u2014and in fact, in the final exam most of the kids wrote about this. You know, I gave them a choice of topics, so I think that one they understood, they got it, so it was really good (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).     6.5.3   Scoping for Stories: Getting Past Resistance and Gaining Trust  Journalists often experience challenges getting a story when they approach people who are suspicious of the media. This suspicion may be even more pronounced amongst racial or religious minorities who are wary of media that misrepresents them, as El-Gawley demonstrated with her experience interviewing Lebanese-Australians who are hostile to Australian media for frequently depicting them as criminals (2009). For Luk, meeting resistance from sources is a lesson in and of itself. The best lesson for them would be if people didn\\u201ft welcome them with open arms and they had to find out how to gain trust, how to persuade people to talk to them. That would be ideal, actually. I don\\u201ft\\u2014I want them to find how difficult it is to get people to talk (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).  To get past this difficulty, Miller and Luk offered their students pointers on how to gain trust from racial minority communities.  Miller said spending time with people in the community can help alleviate tension. He said that in the late 90s, one of the toughest communities to penetrate in Toronto was the Korean 53  community. When he asked some of his students, \\u201cWell, where\\u201fs it located? What\\u201fs there?\\u201d, the group answered, \\u201cWell, there are a lot of karaoke bars.\\u201d Therefore, Miller said, \\u201cWell that\\u201fs a good place to go hang out. Go have a beer and talk to people.\\u201d As a result, students came back with a story: it turns out singing karaoke is a popular way for many young Korean-Canadians who have pulled away from their heritage and cannot speak Korean to get back in touch with their native language.  Spending time in a community in a \\u201cnon-controversial way\\u201d is what Luk calls the \\u201csoft approach.\\u201d However, the \\u201chard approach\\u201d is also necessary, particularly when approaching people in authority.  So door-stopping them, like, waiting and ambushing them when they come out of their office or something, or waiting outside their house,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cSo there\\u201fs many different ways to find out\\u2014of course if somebody won\\u201ft talk to you, you might have to go around them and talk to somebody who works with them. Or another approach should be to talk to the other side and say, \\u201cLook, I\\u201fve got the other side, if you want to give me your side, this is your last chance\\u201d (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).     6.5.4   Establishing Contacts  Once students have gotten past the initial resistance from the community they are reporting on, they must then establish contacts so they can get information for their story assignments. Luk said one of the easiest ways to do so is to assign students a profile story. Students will have to identify a person from the community they are reporting on\\u2014whether it is a particular ethnic group, or an association for people with mental disabilities, or an activist group\\u2014and write a profile story. During that interview, students should find out what other participants from the community they should speak to, and from there, tease out some story ideas.  Because anybody\\u2014everybody has a story, but they\\u201fve got to be sort of participating in some perceived group. You can\\u201ft pick an Iranian-Canadian who has nothing to do with Iranian-Canadians\\u2026I think after you\\u201fve done the profile, you would have met maybe 54  three or four or five people. One of them is going to be able to direct you to something that\\u201fs going on (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).   Here, Luk made an important point about self-racialization and essentialization. It is not enough to identify a perceived racial group and then assume that such a group is homogenous and all members share the same characteristics, values and interests. When reporting on a particular community, journalists must take into consideration context and how people identify themselves. As Luk pointed out, an Iranian-Canadian could be labeled as such due to his race, appearance or citizenship\\u2014he may \\u201clook\\u201d like an Iranian, or be an Iranian by birth who has Canadian citizenship, or a person whose parents are an Iranian and a Canadian, and so on\\u2014but may not identify himself as such. In fact, all three instructors agreed that journalists must be careful not to make generalized constructions of their sources\\u201f identities just to fit them into a story. You can\\u201ft really say anything when you say, \\u201cWell, the black community thinks that\\u2026Well, the black community is very diverse. Lots of communities are very diverse, and I said, \\u201cWell, it\\u201fs like the white community. Who speaks for the white community? You know, it\\u201fs very diverse.\\u201d So let\\u201fs go out of the notion that we\\u201fre going to do this group today or this week, and another group next week. News doesn\\u201ft work like that (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).   Likewise, Luk said that one of the valued skills of reporting is understanding the complexity of an issue, and translating it into simple terms for the reader without oversimplifying or distorting the truth. Therefore, part of the instructor\\u201fs lecture must include lessons about stereotyping and about assuming a monolithic community. In addition, both she and Ma said that lessons must be given on intersectionality of identities, and how slotting sources in a particular identity can become problematic. Here, Luk gave the example of reporting on people with mental illnesses, and argued that stories on mental illnesses in the mainstream press tends to focus only on either homeless people, or on middle-class, white people whose first 55  language is English and who have been in Canada for several generations. And it\\u201fs just a presumption that it doesn\\u201ft cross ethnic groups, it doesn\\u201ft cross class. We don\\u201ft have mental illness [stories] about Muslims, for instance, and there are. We don\\u201ft have mental illness stories about Chinese, or gay people, because that\\u201fs really touchy right (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011)?  Therefore, Luk suggested that a good teaching strategy is to have students pick a perceived group in the community\\u2014whether it\\u201fs an ethnic group, or a group of transgendered people or people who are HIV-positive\\u2014and from there, scout out a possible story about someone who is suffering from a mental illness.  Ma also stressed to her students the importance of maintaining an updated source list. She encouraged students to write down the name and phone numbers of everyone they speak to in order to get a variety of sources. That way, they are not constantly relying on the same \\u201cexpert\\u201d for their stories. Going to that same expert for a quote is one of the pitfalls that journalists often fall into, and is a reason why stories can turn out one-sided.  You\\u201fre on a deadline so [you\\u201fre] going to call that same older professor at the School of\\u2026you know, Health, because he can always answer the questions about whatever your story is about\\u2026Aboriginals in Winnipeg, or you know, high suicide rates (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  But by talking to different experts who are knowledgeable about the same issue, students can bring fresh perspectives to an old, tired story. The other thing is, well, let\\u201fs look at the story from a different angle instead of constantly looking at the question of why, hmm\\u2026let\\u201fs see, there\\u201fs a high suicide rate amongst Aboriginal youth in Winnipeg. Maybe the question could be, instead, today or this week is, what are youth doing in a positive way? So it\\u201fs about also flipping that very paradigm (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  56  7  Conclusion  Through my research, I discovered that teaching journalism students to report on issues involving racial diversity in a fair and accurate way is not simply about setting up a course and teaching students about best practices. Instead, as Ryerson instructors John Miller, Joy Luk and Kali Ma have proven, instructors have to deal with a multitude of issues that have less to do with the mechanics of giving lectures, assigning readings and marking assignments, and more to do with managing complex emotions that arise from student opposition and faculty politics. First, the instructor must always be conscious that getting students to discuss touchy subjects such as race and/or gender forces students to confront their own unconscious biases. This in turn can cause them to resent the course and its instructors. Therefore, the instructor must be a good course facilitator in the sense that he or she can establish a safe haven for students to speak honestly about their opinions and to alleviate tension when it builds up. On the other hand, allowing students to speak openly can induce them to direct hostile and wounding comments at the professor. Thus, teaching this course can mean instructors have to deal with a fair bit of hurt and frustration, particularly when the topic is something they are very passionate about or can relate to. Thus, they must be prepared to manage those emotions. Finally, advocates for a separate course on diversity coverage or for the inclusion of a diversity element into the entire journalism curriculum must be prepared for a possible lack of appreciation on faculty\\u201fs part for diversity\\u201fs relevance to journalism education. This could mean that advocates may have to consider how fighting for such a course can affect their employment or relationship with other faculty members. As a result, whether the UBC Graduate School of Journalism chooses to establish a separate course focused on covering diversity or to further incorporate a diversity element into all their reporting classes, the faculty must take these factors into consideration. 57  Bibliography El-Gawley, N., & O'Donnell, P.

COURSE OUTLINE JANUARY 2006  Some of the biggest issues in the news today \\u2013 from the war on terror, to the debate over immigration, to the coverage of crime and policing, to the conflict in the Middle East \\u2013 draw journalists into questions about race, religion and ethnicity. To get the story, you may have to unlearn stereotypes, get people to trust you who are suspicious of the media or even hostile, and ask awkward questions about religious, cultural and historical traditions. Toronto is one of the world\\u2018s most cosmopolitan cities. Fifty-two percent of its residents are foreign born, and most of them are non-white. So no matter who you are, one out of every two interviews you do may be with someone of a different colour, culture or religion. The people who read, watch or listen to your work will reflect the same diversity. This puts a special responsibility on journalists. Why? Because coverage that springs from ignorance, or is inhibited by fear of the unfamiliar, falls short of the core values of fairness, clarity, context and accuracy. In this course, you will learn the tools to do it right.  Format: Undergraduate students in all streams of third year will meet each week for a two- hour general presentation, lecture or group discussion. This large group will be divided into four smaller one-hour seminar groups, each with its own instructor, to discuss the presentation or do practical exercises stemming from it.  Goals: We will:  Identify nine ideas for strengthening journalism.  Use them as tools to address some blind spots journalism has on matters of race and  religion.  Understand why and how some groups are often ignored or stereotyped by the 62   mainstream media.  Develop a strategy to fairly and accurately cover these groups and individuals.  Find fresh story ideas \\u2013\\u2013 about achievement as well as conflict \\u2013\\u2013 within these  communities.  Learn how to frame stories properly to add depth and context.  Pitch diversity stories to the professional media. Text: Students must buy the yellow workbook that contains readings for class and seminars. It\\u2018s sold in the bookstore \\u2013\\u201cCritical Issues in Journalism: Workbook, readings and tips for JRN 301.\\u201d  What is diversity? Diversity means difference, and this can include differences of language, cultural background, race, gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, religion and physical ability. In this course, we will focus on cross-cultural reporting, and the skills required to tell interesting and accurate stories through the lens of race and religion. You will be expected to cover stories in communities where you are a visible minority.  Ethics: Cross-cultural reporting is really about practicing good journalism. Since a journalist is only as valuable as his or her integrity, we expect that each piece of work you submit is purely your own; that all sources of information and quotations are scrupulously attributed; and that your reporting is actual and current. Penalties for fabrication or plagiarism range from failure in the assignment to failure in the course.  Ground rules: In this course, we talk about issues that are sometimes difficult to talk about. This is a safe place. We expect you to show respect to your fellow students, to instructors and to guest speakers. But we encourage you to express your thoughts openly. The course will accomplish little if it does not cause you to think more deeply about some of these issues, and challenge some of your assumptions about the world and other people.  Responsibility: You are expected to show up on time for every class. Do not schedule interviews or work for this or other classes during the period you should be here. You must also have a Ryerson e-mail account so instructors can communicate with everyone.  Deadlines: Your work is due on time \\u2013\\u2013 at the beginning of your seminar period, on the week noted. One copy of each assignment must be handed to your instructor in person, or sent by e-mail at the start of class. Late assignments will carry penalties of 20 per cent per day. Missed assignments will be considered grounds for failure. A request for an extended deadline will only be given on medical or compassionate grounds, and only if the instructor is informed before the original due date.  Assignments: (See detailed assignment instructions below) 30% Civic \\u2015mapping\\u2016 assignment (team project) \\u2013\\u2013 You will create a road map for how a particular racial or religious minority community in Toronto works, how journalists can tap into the different layers, and what stories are building beneath the surface. Due on Feb. 7. 40% Feature story \\u2013\\u2013 1,500-word feature story using multiple sources examining an issue that is engaging a diverse community at the moment.

Gross errors of fact, including misspelling a proper name, will be grounds for failure on any assignment. 65   TEAM PROJECT \\u2013\\u2013 Civic mapping (30%) Due on Feb. 7. Form yourselves into groups of four to select a community that no one in your group has ties to. You may choose a racial or religious minority that does not appear on the list handed out on Jan. 17, but it must be approved by your instructor. Follow the outline and instructions for Civic Mapping in your workbook. Your report should be written in point form under the following headings: (a) Overview of community (b) How things get dealt with (c) The go-to places (d) The go-to sources (e) History (f) Current issues (g) Sensitivities  Major feature project (40%) Outline due on Feb. 14, story on March 21. You will pitch your major feature story idea at a meeting with your instructor on Feb. 14. You need a written outline for that meeting based on your research, preliminary interviews/visits/observations. The outline should be divided into the following sections: (a) The community (b) What\\u2018s the story and why is it new; (c) Why the story is interesting/relevant/important; (d) How you know the story is there (discuss your preliminary research, who you spoke to, what you experienced (e) Who you plan to interview and why The focus of the feature should be on the conflicts/achievements/experiences that minorities are facing in Toronto in the year 2004. Particular attention should be paid to how these groups and individuals are being treated by the major institutions of our society. You may also choose to focus on the pressures within those communities (social, generational, economic, political, cultural, etc.) Each 1,000-word story should contain several sources, be written in a featurish style (show- don\\u2018t-tell, strong theme paragraph, etc.) and explore new ground. NOTE: When you identify yourself to sources, say you\\u2018re a Ryerson journalism student working on a classroom project that you hope will be published. All sources for your story should be identified fully with their phone number. Broadcast students have the option of submitting a script for a 5-minute video or audio documentary. EXAMPLES OF ISSUES: Immigration, discrimination, gender, neighbourhoods, business, social services, generational conflict, conflict with another group, urban demographics, religion, education, policing and crime, media portrayal, real estate, political involvement, disability, transportation, public health, sexuality, recognition and achievement, lifestyle/culture, recognition of foreign professional credentials, etc.  Content analysis (20%) Due on April 11. You will monitor five consecutive issues of a newspaper, television newscast or copies of a magazine to assess how they are depicting visible minorities. Content analyses will be explained in class. You should include both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the content. Your 800-word report should include comment on your findings from a member of that news 66  organization. You should pay particular attention to the following areas, and give examples where appropriate: (a) How often visible minorities appear as reporters, commentators and sources; (b) What minority issues are discussed, and how; (c) Your conclusions about how effective this media outlet is in dealing with visible minorities.  Marking criteria Your assignments will be marked by your seminar instructor, who subscribes to the following general guidelines. For each assignment, you will be given a numerical mark (out of 10, 15 or 40, depending on the weight of the assignment). These will be added up and translated into letter grades, using the following standards: A Outstanding work, showing a thorough understanding of the concepts introduced in class and exhibiting critical and original thought. A publishable piece of work. You have tried to break new ground. Your research allows you to give logical and convincing support for your conclusions. You have found excellent sources and used concrete examples. You write with style and clarity. B Very good work, showing a good understanding of the concepts involved. Conclusions are clearly stated, although conventional. There is good support for your conclusions, although you have not addressed some minor areas of the question or assignment. If it\\u2018s a reporting assignment, it may need more sources or questions answered but are basically a sound story. C Satisfactory work, showing a good attempt to understand the concepts involved. Conclusions may be clearly stated but show gaps in logic or research. Writing is fuzzy, to the point that it blunts some of your findings. Several aspects of the questions have not been addressed. Sources are mainly the usual suspects; you haven\\u2018t dug for new ones. Work cannot be published until more research is done. D Passable work, but with a poor attempt to understand and address the key concepts. Not all conclusions are supported by logic or research and sometimes you fail to include key elements of the question. Writing is sloppy. Key sources have not been interviewed. F Unacceptable work because you fail to deal with the key concepts and are unclear about your conclusions. You have done little or no research and only skim the surface of the issue. Your points are poorly argued. The sources are not appropriate, or not particularly well 67  interviewed. Failure marks can range from zero to 49 per cent. In the case of very late or missing assignments, the mark will be zero.  68  Appendix B: Critical Issues Syllabus Winter 2010 Ryerson University School of Journalism Faculty of Communication and Design JRN 400: Critical Issues in Journalism Winter 2010 Lecture: 1-2 p.m. Thursdays Room: KHE121 Seminars: 2-4 p.m. Section: 012 Room: KHE 220  Section: 021 Room: KHE 222   Introduction This is a time of unparalleled opportunity and challenge in journalism. Dramatic social, technological, political and economic changes are transforming the world and the way we report on it.  Toronto is one of the world\\u2019s most cosmopolitan cities. Fifty-two percent of its residents are foreign-born, and most of these are nonwhite. So no matter who we are, half of the interviews we do as journalists in Toronto are likely to be with someone of a different colour, culture or religion. Local viewers, listeners and readers reflect this same diversity. Regional and national audiences are also diverse, albeit in different ways.  Therefore, the practice of journalism today requires an understanding of the diversity on display in our societies, an awareness of the pitfalls inherent in reporting on unfamiliar communities, and a concern for those that are invisible or whose stories aren\\u2019t being told. We need to be aware of diversity issues in our own ranks, and of what may be lost when newsrooms and their leaders do not reflect a broad range of 69  experience. We also need to recognize blindspots in specific genres or beats such as war, the arts, or health.   Today\\u2019s journalists are required to assume new and difficult challenges. The unstoppable reach of the Internet \\u2013 from online news aggregates to the rise of citizen journalism \\u2013 has redrawn the traditional lines between professional and amateur journalism and affected major revenues sources for the former. We must be aware of how our own coverage, because of unfamiliarity, ignorance, fear, or over-reliance on questionable sources, may fall short of our core journalistic values of fairness, clarity, context and accuracy. JRN 400 aims to sharpen your critical faculties through topics explored in three units:  1- Covering Diversity: gender, race, religion, mental illness and physical disabilities. 2- Beats/Genres: War, Crime, Health/Science, sports 3- Other Issues: Citizen journalism, the effects of media concentration, convergence and corporate influence. 70   Format  All students meet on Thursdays from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in KHE 121 for a lecture, which may include guest speakers and video presentations. Immediately following, two separate seminar groups will meet for two hours, 2 to 4 p.m., in rooms nearby to discuss the assigned readings and continue the discussion.  Communication  There\\u2019s no assigned textbook. All readings (journal articles, as well as newspaper and magazine features) will be posted on Blackboard on a weekly basis in PDF or Word documents, or as web links.  The site will serve as a notice board, so please check regularly for updates.  Please note that some articles that cannot be read online may be distributed in hard copy during class time.

Seminar will deal more specifically with how to begin the civic mapping assignment. Week 2, Jan 14 - Diversity: Covering Gender A look at representation of women in the news media and how women's roles and experiences in newsrooms inform their coverage. Has the glass ceiling finally been shattered or is diversity in newsrooms just an illusion? Week 3, Jan. 21 \\u2013 Diversity: Covering Religion In the last decade, Islam, more than any other religion, has increasingly and almost exclusively been identified with terrorism in the Western mainstream news media \\u2013 often challenging Western notions of tolerance, plurality and accommodation. What is the role and responsibility of the news media regarding the depiction of Islamic culture and Islam as a religion? What is the responsibility of journalists in expanding the range of Muslim voices in areas affecting Muslim populations and stereotypes about Muslims? Have journalists acted as responsible guides or fear mongers? Week 4, Jan 28- Diversity: Covering Race An overview of topics, such as, First Nations, racial profiling, categories such as \\u201cvisible minority\\u201d and \\u201cperson of colour,\\u201d and what they mean to journalism and newsrooms. Week 5, Feb. 4 \\u2013 Diversity: Covering mental illness and physical disabilities From coverage of homelessness to sports, journalists are often devoid of accurate and sensitive vocabulary and lack understanding to deal with mental and physical ailments.  This class will explore some of the challenges journalists face covering these areas. Week 6, Feb 11 \\u2013 Beats: Sports (MID-TERM EXAM on readings and class discussions) READING WEEK: Feb 18: No lecture or seminar. 73  Week 7, Feb. 25 - Beats: War \\u2013(CIVIC MAPPING ASSIGNMENT DUE War reportage makes for some of the most dangerous but also exciting work for many journalists.  But how accurate is the picture journalists portray from conflict zones when they are filing stories while embedded with troops and when dealing with military censorship?  This class will also explore whether journalists working with the demands of 24/7 news cycles have the tools to cover war fairly. Week 8, March 4 - Beats: Celebrities - One of the big criticisms of Barack Obama during the 2008 election was that he was a celebrity \\u2013 triggering a YouTube defence from famous-for-being-famous Paris Hilton. How do we avoid being driven to distraction by the boldfaced names? Week 9, March 11 \\u2013 Beats: Health/Science - Health journalism may arguably be one of the most important forms of public service.  But how well do journalists understand the studies they report on?  How honest are the sources they draw from?  And, how do you report risk without sensationalized scare mongering and without spreading misleading information? Week 10, March 18 \\u2013 Beats: Fluff - Jan So your editor has assigned you to get a bikini wax or wear a burqa for a day or write about Martha Stewart\\u2019s new line of bed sheets. How to commit journalism while writing about fluff? We\\u2019ll teach you how to take a stupid story to the next level by never giving up, by always doing your best.  OTHER CRITICAL AREAS: Week 11, March 25 \\u2013 Concentration of ownership, Convergence and corporate influence on news.

The impact of Blogs, the Internet, YouTube, twitter, and other video/photo uploading, upcoming technology on the creation and dissemination of news.  Will professional journalists become irrelevant as more and more bloggers and videographers take the 74  news into their own hands? We will examine the merits and shortfalls of citizen journalism. Is comment the same as reporting? Does opinion equal analysis?  Is more journalism better for journalists? Week 13, April 8 \\u2013 The next wave of critical issues for the news media Critical issues look-ahead with an industry-wide panel discussion. (May change to analyze recent case study) Marking criteria  Here is Ryerson University\\u2019s numerical-to-letter-grade conversion table:  Letter grade  Percentage range A+   90-100 A   85-89 A-                  80-84 B+   77-79 B     73-76 B-             70-72 C+    67-69 C    63-66 C-                  60-62 D+   57-59 D                   53-56 D-                  50-52 F    0-49  In-class tests and take-home exams will be graded according to the following criteria:  A (80-100) \\u2013 Outstanding work, showing a thorough understanding of the concepts introduced in class and exhibiting critical and original thought.

It is considered indispensable by many journalists on the job and is invaluable for background on current issues.           76  Appendix C: Critical Issues Syllabus Fall 2010  JRN 400: Critical Issues in Journalism \\u2028Fall 2010 / Wednesday 2- 5pm\\u2028\\u2028 \\u2028------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Introduction The post 9/11 decade marks a time of unparalleled opportunity and challenge in journalism. Dramatic social, technological, political and economic changes are transforming the world and the way we report on it. \\u2028\\u2028This course will explore controversial and critical journalistic issues and aims to sensitize students to the global geo-political context that underlies the conventions and practices of contemporary journalism. \\u2028\\u2028New challenges include digital journalism redrawing the traditional lines between professional and amateur journalism - with tools like twitter, online news aggregates, and YouTube affecting major revenues sources and the \\u201cauthority\\u201d of news makers. \\u2028\\u2028All of this is taking place against fault lines in the traditional role of news media as a watchdog of democracy and a champion of its citizenry\\u2019s right to know \\u2013 not to mention some gutsy and perplexing advances by the public relations machine into editorial content.\\u2028\\u2028 Is journalism in danger of losing its place at the heart of democratic society? Are the only journalists telling the truth actually comedians? What purpose does tabloid journalism serve? How has the ubiquity of \\u201cThe image\\u201d change the way we see the world? \\u2028\\u2028By placing journalism in a wider intellectual and historical context, this course seeks to produce a large sense of journalism as a vocation as it relates to politics and civic life. Some topics looked at include:\\u2028\\u2028*journalism\\u2019s role in a democracy\\u2028*reporting conflict, terrorism and war\\u2028*the future of investigative journalism\\u2028*race and ideology\\u2028*the image\\u2028*global civil society \\u2028\\u2028With that in mind, Critical Issues in Journalism will be divided into four units, each encompassing several critical issues:  1. Democracy: press freedoms, recent violations of press freedoms 2. Spin and Media Ownership: fake editorials, gatekeepers 77  3. Diversity:  newsroom debates and critiques of media on gender, race, religion and sexuality 4. Digital Challenges: citizen journalism, twitter, social networking  2. Week-by-week class schedule 3. 78  \\u2028\\u2028Week 1, Sept. 7: Journalism Realities - \\u2028\\u2028Due: course registration, brainstorm session (lecture), 1 test question and answer (seminar)\\u2028\\u2028Lecture: Introduction to the course (overview of topics through case studies) and questions about syllabus. Brainstorming of journalism realities: What is journalism? What are journalists? What have they been and what are they becoming? What is the relation between journalism and democracy? Between journalism and public life? What means have been used to control journalism and journalists? Journalism has had a long and complicated history with democracy. The recent past \\u2013 post-9/11 \\u2013 has challenged our conceptions of freedom and rights. The future, particularly with a grinding recession underway, looks uncertain, turbulent and more ideologically charged.\\u2028 Case Study: The Runaway General\\u2028\\u2028 Seminar: Discussion of lecture and readings.

Specifically, the study addresses this larger question in the context of informing the development of the first national terminology guide on the coverage of Aboriginal issues by the Strategic Alliance of Broadcasters for Aboriginal Reflection (hereafter referred to as SABAR).  1.1 What is SABAR? It is important to begin this thesis with a definition of what SABAR is. I will also explain how SABAR came to develop a terminology guide for Aboriginal reporting. SABAR is \\u201ca group of Canadian broadcasters and Aboriginal organizations working to increase the contribution and [reflection] of Aboriginal people in all aspects of the Canadian broadcast industry\\u201d (SABAR, n.d., About SABAR section, para. 1). Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) and a group of broadcasters and media organizations initiated SABAR in 2003. Since then SABAR has teamed with major broadcasters, educational institutions and Aboriginal groups to facilitate increased participation and more accurate depiction of Aboriginal people in the broadcast industry. Accurate Aboriginal reflection in broadcast journalism is one of SABAR\\u2019s primary concerns, and currently there is a significant gap in the area in the Canadian media. SABAR has identified that a key way to address this gap may be through the development of a terminology guide for Aboriginal reporting. This guide will provide a unique contribution to information source for journalists and will represent an important step toward accurately reflecting Aboriginality. The main journalistic guide in Canada, The Canadian Press  2 Stylebook (Tasko, 2010), deals with issues of Aboriginality very tangentially; although the resource is nearly 500-pages in length, only three pages are dedicated to Aboriginal reporting. In other words, SABAR\\u2019s guide addresses a critical void in journalistic resources regarding accurate depictions of Aboriginal people. This study draws from interviews with broadcast journalists that were identified by SABAR, asking them what information they believe they need in order to ensure more accurate reporting of Aboriginal people. Past research concerning media and minority relations has often involved content analyses of newspapers and broadcast programs. In this study, however, I work closely with SABAR and deliberately act as a conduit between the group and journalists in order to most effectively inform the development of SABAR\\u2019s guide. This methodological approach intends to contribute to the epistemology surrounding the complex relationship between Aboriginal people and journalism.  1.2 Why this Study is Critical This research is important because portrayals of racialized groups in the media shape the way citizens learn about these communities, yet these groups have historically been underrepresented and misrepresented in media accounts, thereby fostering a Eurocentric cultural hegemony (Mahtani, 2001). Media scholars have repeatedly claimed that this type of mistreatment tarnishes the relationship between Aboriginal people and the media (Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2000, 2002; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Mahtani, 2008). Valerie Alia studied the representation of Northern Aboriginal people in three newspapers for a two-year period in the early-1990s. She states, \\u201cNorthern and [I]ndigenous people receive coverage in \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 media primarily in times of crisis\\u201d (p. 144),  3 resulting in a public sphere that comes to associate Northern communities with negative issues. Furthermore, Augie Fleras and Jean Lock Kunz (2001) suggest that the negativity that permeates coverage of Aboriginal affairs \\u201cpaints a villainous picture of Canada\\u2019s [F]irst [P]eoples [sic] 1 , inasmuch as success stories are rarely reported, and those that do succeed are proof of exceptions to the rule\\u201d (p. 146). Depicting Aboriginal people in these ways directly opposes Section 3 of the Canadian Broadcasting Act (1991). The act states that Canada\\u2019s broadcasting system should, through its programming\\u2026serve the needs and interests, and reflect the circumstances and aspirations, of Canadian men, women and children, including equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of [A]boriginal peoples within that society. (1991, Section 3)  Canadian media scholars have pointed out that marginalized groups, and in particular, racialized groups, have repeatedly been demonized and misrepresented in media accounts. However, while there is a growing body of literature that explores that misrepresentation, there remain even fewer academic analyses that focus on the misrepresentation of Aboriginal people (Francis, 1992; Lambertus, 2000). This is an ongoing problem for ethnic minorities, but an even bigger issue epistemologically for Aboriginal people. The media routinely misrepresent Aboriginal people and the impact of these skewed portrayals can have serious social repercussions for those who have been inaccurately reflected in the news. Journalism must be recognized as inaccurate not only when facts are reported incorrectly but also when it fails to reflect the diversity of the communities included in its reports. As David Yarnold (n.d.) notes, \\u201c[d]iversity in your content is as important as getting  1  The use of Canada in the possessive form is problematic. More accurate writing would read: \\u201cpaints a villainous picture of First Peoples in Canada\\u201d. In accordance with SABAR\\u2019s guide, writers should avoid describing Aboriginal people as \\u201cbelonging\\u201d to Canada.  4 people\\u2019s names right. It\\u2019s a fundamental component of accuracy\\u201d (para. 1). Hanson and Wearden (2004) argue that \\u201c[t]he promise to deliver accurate information is at the heart of the unspoken contract that journalists have with their readers and viewers\\u201d (p. 546). In this thesis I speak about the important relationship that emerges between misrepresentation and accuracy. In my view, accuracy tends to be defined in narrow terms. While it is the basis of important journalistic practices such as verification, accuracy in journalism can be conceptualized in ways that move beyond its traditional frame of thoroughly researching stories and checking for errors. This study aims to contribute to that conversation by exploring how a commitment to accuracy in journalism includes a commitment to diversity. The literature in communications, journalism and media studies provides the theoretical lens through which I will examine this study. I draw upon research on media diversity initiatives and journalism guides to better understand the role of SABAR\\u2019s own guide. I also refer to work that explores conceptualizing accuracy in the role of guides intended to inform diversity in journalism. I now turn to a review of this relevant research.  5 Chapter  2: Literature Review My study explores how the format and content of SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide can be informed through interviews with broadcast journalists. This project is embedded in a body of research that explores media-minority relations, journalism guides, and accuracy. To this end, the literature review is comprised of three parts. The first section examines media diversity strategies that have been recommended to alter problematic representations and why they are important. The second addresses how guides fit into these strategies. The third section examines how to conceptualize accuracy in a guide that informs diverse journalism.  2.1  Media Diversity Strategies 2.1.1 In Context: Why Diversity Strategies are Important Scholars have repeatedly pointed out that Aboriginal people are misrepresented and underrepresented in journalistic accounts. Fleras and Kunz study media-minorty relations in Canada. They emphasize that mainstream media supposedly provide a range of viewpoints, uphold neutrality and objectivity, and give fair access to everyone; however, in reality, they \\u201cappear to do the opposite when minorities are involved\\u201d (2001, p. 1). The authors write that the systematic bias in representations of minorities in the media can be accurately described as media racism: Media racism acknowledges the pervasive influence of both structures and agendas that have an unintended yet negative effect\\u2014both systematic and subliminal\\u2014of misrepresenting minority women and men\\u2026[it is] rooted in those foundational structures and operational principles that systematically define \\u201chow things are done around here,\\u201d while remaining anchored in a mediacentric mindset that appears beyond challenge, and is secured by subliminal biases that inadvertently deny or exclude. (2001, p. 43-44)   6 Fleras and Kunz found Canadian media were flawed yet not overtly racist, and the people the media routinely mistreats have demanded more inclusive representations in order to better reflect their realities. Drawing on work by media studies scholar Sue Abel (1997), Fleras and Kunz note initiatives for establishing an inclusive media include the following requirements: \\u201c(a) the incorporation of minority perspectives into the media process, (b) multicultural programming, (c) balanced and impartial newscasting, and (d) sensitivity training for journalists and decision makers\\u201d (2001, p. 157). These are but a few of the recommendations that media scholars offer in order to challenge problematic representations.  Frances Henry and Carol Tator (2002) provide further justification for the development of media diversity strategies. In their book Discourses of Domination: Racial Bias in the Canadian English-Language Press, Henry and Tator apply critical discourse analysis to a series of case studies found in the Canadian print media (specifically, articles were taken from the Globe and Mail, National Post, Regina Leader Post, Saskatoon Star Phoenix, Toronto Star, and Toronto Sun) to study how the media construct racist discourse. They found several discursive themes dominated coverage of the case studies under examination: the discourse of denial; the discourse of political correctness; the discourse of colour evasion or colour blindness; the discourse of equal opportunity; the discourse of blame the victim, or white victimization; the discourses of \\u2018otherness\\u2019; the discourse of national identity; the discourse of moral panic; the discourse of tolerance (p. 228-234). Taken together, they argue that these discourses create an environment of democratic racism (Henry, Tator, Mattis, & Rees, 2000).  Other scholars (Henry & Tator, 2000; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Mahtani, 2002, 2009) mediate on similar but not identical themes. These studies emphasize that racist tropes are  7 subtly and not so subtly integrated and ingrained into journalism. The literature demonstrates that the media are not objective in their reporting, and instead promote discourses that support an ideology that marginalizes minority groups, including Aboriginal people. For example, in an analysis of 128 Vancouver Sun articles about the murdered and missing women in Vancouver\\u2019s Downtown Eastside, Jiwani and Young (2006) note the \\u201cpersistent signification of Aboriginality\\u201d (p. 910). They found that the continual inclusion of Ernie Crey, the brother of one of the murdered women and himself the former United First Nations president, \\u201cserved the function of fixing Aboriginality as a sign of the missing and murdered women\\u201d (p. 910). Here, the media made direct linkages among crime, violence, prostitution and Aboriginality, further marginalizing the women.  While racist discourses marginalize and oppress those outside the mainstream, some groups have responded by resisting them. Henry and Tator (2002) observe that writers of colour and First Nations writers, minority community groups, and the ethnic media have all made moves to provide oppositional discourses, thereby offering alternative voices in the news (p. 237-238). Additionally, the authors underscore the need for media workers to practice greater reflexivity on the job to support diversity, Journalists and editors need to understand how their own social identities, histories, and frames of reference affect their work; and how whiteness acts as a filter, screening out the contradictions and complexities of issues related to race and racism, culture and ethnicity, and other social phenomena. (2002, p. 239)  Henry and Tator\\u2019s research demonstrates that there is no single solution to the problems that permeate Canadian news media, and a range of diversity initiatives is required. Specifically, media diversity strategies that target inaccurate representation of minority groups can help remedy the ongoing misrepresentation of those communities by providing journalists with the necessary resources to produce more informed journalism.  8  One strategy that continually surfaces in the literature is the inclusion of the perspectives of minority journalists to inform the production of news. However, some suggest that accurate reflection does not necessarily follow inclusion. For example, in Deadlines and Diversity: Journalism Ethics in a Changing World (1996), Bud White Eye, an Aboriginal reporter, recalls his struggles at the London Free Press in Ontario during the early-1990s, I told them that if I do a story, I want it done the way I do it. I\\u2019m a First Nations writer, this is a First Nations perspective, a First Nations writing style. If you change it to your way, there\\u2019s no sense having me. You might as well go out and do it yourself. After 145 years of existence, I don\\u2019t think the Free Press had ever had a First Nations writer before I got there. To finally have a First Nations writer and say, \\u201cWe want your style, we want your perspective,\\u201d then go back to the office and start making changes\\u2014how on earth can you edit a First Nations person\\u2019s style or content if you\\u2019ve never worked with one before? How can you get that different flavour if you start changing things?...Unless you come out of a school of journalism assimilated and write like mainstream white journalists, they don\\u2019t want you. (p. 96)  Despite the diversity White Eye could offer\\u2014the \\u201cflavour\\u201d, as he calls it\\u2014his perspective was not valued. Leslie Joynt notes this issue of invisibility is \\u201cdiscouragingly familiar\\u201d (1995, para. 3) in Canadian newsrooms.  The misrepresentation of Aboriginal people in journalistic accounts is a global problem. Australian academic Michael Meadows (1994) suggests that Aboriginal people are \\u201cprobably the most misrepresented of all because of their place within colonial discourse\\u201d (p. 64), and although contemporary coverage in the media may have shifted from portraying Aboriginal peoples as victims to threats, \\u201cin essence, [I]ndigenous issues remain stereotyped or, as is more likely to be the case, omitted from the discourse\\u201d (p. 64). As a result, Aboriginal communities have culturally appropriated technologies such as satellite television and community radio \\u201cessentially as a response to a perceived racist mainstream media representation and a technologist-driven media environment\\u201d (p. 64). Meadows refers to the  9 imposition of satellite broadcasting systems on Australia and Canada to illustrate this appropriation. For instance, the Warlpiri, a group of Indigenous Australians, developed the Tanami Network\\u2014an integration of videoconferencing and satellite technologies\\u2014to connect four Tanami Desert communities with the rest of the world. As an example, videoconferencing is used to contact family, deliver educational and training courses, and remotely diagnose medical cases. Meadows suggests a telecommunications system of this kind has considerable implications for local broadcasting by Aboriginal communities, and it \\u201cdemonstrates the possibility for empowerment inherent in such technology\\u201d (p. 67). By adopting and appropriating television and radio technologies, Aboriginal communities create a new kind of media that challenges the very same mainstream systems that prompted development of these different forms in the first place. Meadows makes the connection between Indigenous media production and media diversity strategies clear: \\u201cThrough their inherent notions of potential empowerment, such [I]ndigenous initiatives represent a radical opposition to the cultural hegemony of mass media\\u201d (p. 71).  Journalism scholar Mercedes Lynn de Uriarte (2003) examined media reform within the context of media coverage of Latinos in the United States and Mexico. Since the mid- 1800s, when newspapers named the first American foreign correspondent to cover the country\\u2019s war with Mexico, de Uriarte found that \\u201caccuracy has, more often than not, been distorted by a grid of xenophobia, racism, ignorance and social distance\\u201d (p. 39). Through mistreatment by the media, Latinos experienced \\u201cexclusion, stereotype, a propensity of negative and distorted coverage, low participation in mainstream media and almost no opportunity themselves to provide alternative points of view\\u201d (p. 40-41). de Uriarte found these same problems also influence African Americans, Asians Americans and American  10 Indians (p. 41). To accurately cover Latino communities, journalists require a better understanding of the context of their stories. [T]he press must overcome an ignorance of history. Although newsroom guidelines and press ethics abound, neither substitute for in-depth knowledge of the people being covered. Recognition of context requires a good grasp of history. Few schools or universities prepare students to perceive a multicultural America, or to understand that minority groups are neither a new phenomenon nor an insignificant one. But because they do not appear in depth in most textbooks and they still have not been acknowledged in society\\u2019s major institutions, most minority groups remain invisible. Their past is unknown, their present obscured. (p. 53)  de Uriarte notes that while coverage of Latinos is generally better and more abundant than it was in the past, it must continue to improve, and the best strategy for improvement is greater familiarity with Latinos and other minority communities on the part of journalists.  Dori Maynard (2011) suggests the conversation around diversity in journalism needs to be reframed. She points to the \\u201cchanging demographics and growing gulf between journalists and the communities they cover\\u201d (para. 1) as evidence that commitments from news organizations to accurately reflect the country have not been renewed. Maynard argues that if diversity is not a priority then it is time to admit it; conversely, if it really is important then it is time to invest energy in ways to diversify the media.  The above literature provides the context for why media diversity strategies are important. Scholars have exposed the continuing problems involving the coverage of Aboriginal people in journalism, thereby providing the impetus for diversity initiatives. I will now review a number of these strategies in practice.  2.1.2 In Practice: Diversity Strategies at Work The majority of media diversity strategies discussed in this thesis have been implemented in the United States. The country\\u2019s oldest professional journalistic organization,  11 the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), is an example. The encouragement of diversity in journalism is listed among the society\\u2019s missions (SPJ, 1996-2011, Our Mission section). As such, the SPJ developed the Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook. The sourcebook is a compilation of names and contact information for experts in areas ranging from agriculture to health and medicine to technology and is intended to encourage better sourcing by journalists. The experts listed in the sourcebook are from groups \\u201chistorically underrepresented in the media: women, gays and lesbians, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities\\u201d (The Quill, 1999). The sourcebook addresses a critical aspect of media diversity: who is quoted. This is a particularly important question given the prevalence of non-minority voices in the news. In a study of new sources in five British Press newspapers, Teun A. van Dijk (1991) found \\u201cthat minority group members are quoted less often and less extensively than majority group members, even when the topics directly concern them, and even if there are minority experts available to give an opinion\\u201d (p. 174). In addition to the Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook, SPJ\\u2019s website offers a Diversity Toolbox (SPJ, 1996-2011, Diversity Toolbox section). This digital storage space is filled with other strategies for creating an inclusive media environment, like suggestions for language use and tips on smarter reporting.  The Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education (MIJE) is an organization committed to promoting diversity in journalism. Co-founded in 1977 by Robert C. Maynard, himself an African American journalist, the institute helps news media reflect the country\\u2019s diversity in content, staffing, and operations (Maynard Institute, 2011, About section, para. 1). Notable among MIJE\\u2019s initiatives is its Fault Lines training program. Developed by Maynard, the program is a tool for journalists and teachers alike, functioning as \\u201ca means through which social debate may be analyzed to strengthen the depth, the thoroughness and  12 the social representation of our classroom and journalistic content\\u201d (Miller & Hsu, 2008, p. 118). Maynard identified five Fault Lines: race (including ethnicity), class, gender (including sexual orientation), generation and geography. These Fault Lines frame the ways in which people better see themselves, and more broadly, the world (Miller & Hsu, 2008, p. 119). The program challenges journalists and students to expand their definition of diversity by moving beyond the stale conceptualization of diversity as an issue of race and gender. It was Maynard\\u2019s belief that the Fault Lines framework \\u201cwould help enable teachers and the media to fully, fairly and accurately represent the entire community with regard to whatever the social or philosophical issue\\u201d (Miller & Hsu, 2008, p. 119). Comprehensive training is an important component of diversifying the media. An additional diversity initiative aimed at educating journalists is The Authentic Voice: The Best Reporting on Race and Ethnicity (2006), an instructional guide for both journalism students and industry professionals. Building on award-winning stories featured in the \\u201cLet\\u2019s Do It Better!\\u201d Workshop on Journalism, Race and Ethnicity at Columbia University\\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism\\u2014a media diversity strategy in itself\\u2014The Authentic Voice is a three-prong approach to providing accurate race and ethnicity reporting: the resource integrates a textbook, a DVD, and a website. Each story presented is a case of what the authors deem to be examples of best practices in journalism. The aforementioned \\u201cLet\\u2019s Do It Better!\\u201d Workshop was developed in part by Arlene Morgan, former assistant managing editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer and current Associate Dean at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. The project was based on improving journalism by critiquing stories that were already in the paper (Morgan, 2008, p. 131). Morgan structured a pilot workshop around a controversial story that appeared in her  13 former newspaper. Twenty randomly selected editors, reporters, photographers, copy editors, and graphic artists debated the strengths and weaknesses of the story. The conversations were moderated, and Morgan says what evolved was an honest discussion on race reporting, noting the project\\u2019s success is rooted in its bottom line: making journalism better (2008, p. 133). The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism adopted Morgan\\u2019s workshop idea in 1999 and she has been director of the program since 2000. Another strategy geared towards promoting an inclusive media through education is the Forum on Diversity, a project of the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University. The forum \\u201cis based on the ideas that representative and diverse coverage can determine the success of the news industry, and better journalism/mass communication education will help achieve this goal\\u201d (Forum on Media Diversity, 2011, About section, para. 2). To this end, the forum offers a list of media diversity syllabi submitted by teachers and professors from across the United States to aid in the development of curricula and to help improve teaching. The Forum on Diversity\\u2019s website provides the rationale for creating such a list: \\u201cTeaching is the heart of good journalism/mass communication programs, and diversity is the heart of good teaching. Good ideas contribute to good teaching, and good ideas are better if they\\u2019re shared\\u201d (Forum on Media Diversity, 2011, Media Diversity Syllabi section, para. 1). Additionally, the forum hosts seminars and conferences pertaining to media diversity, and the results of one conference on diversity in communication media and higher education yielded the Diversity That Works (2008) report. This work includes personalized reports from conference participants on specific diversity initiatives undertaken by his or her educational or media institute. According to Ralph Izard, editor of the report, The Manship School \\u201chope[s] to provide a source of ideas that may be  14 locally adapted in a way that helps others achieve greater excellence in the educational opportunities they provide their students\\u201d (2008, p. 7). I have provided context for why media diversity strategies are important, and I have also reviewed various initiatives at work. It is critical to note that not one of the strategies reviewed specifically targets Aboriginal representation. I will now explore how journalism guides fit into these strategies.  2.2 Guides as a Component of Media Diversity Strategies In journalism there are guides that govern journalists in their work, some of which fit into media diversity strategies like those reviewed above, thereby helping journalists navigate the complex topics of race and ethnicity. A review of these guides underscores the need for a resource dedicated solely to Aboriginal reporting, because even when Aboriginality is addressed in the guides the information is limited. In Canada, the Radio-Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) produced a comprehensive toolkit titled Everyone\\u2019s Story: Reflecting Canada\\u2019s Diversity (2007) to help broadcasters across the country reflect diversity. The bilingual guide and accompanying DVD include tips on proper language use, with lists of inclusive terms; diversity checklists for reporters, editors, management, and the newsroom; and sections for covering Aboriginal people and people with disabilities. (The guide dedicates five pages to Aboriginal people and the media.) According to Renato Zane, then Chair of RTNDA\\u2019s Diversity Committee, it is the hope of the organization that, above all, the guide will be used to \\u201cfind ways to reflect diversity in everything your newsroom does \\u2013 from administration to story development to  15 on-air delivery to community relations\\u201d (2007, p. 5). Zane also notes that if diversity is built into daily routines, then news organizations will benefit (2007, p. 5). As previously mentioned, in the United States the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) offers a Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook \\u201cto broaden the perspectives represented in the media\\u201d (The Quill, 1999). The book contains names and contact information for experts in a wide range of areas. All of the experts are from groups not commonly represented in the media, such as ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. Acting as a searchable database of experts from underrepresented demographic groups, the resource promotes diversity in sourcing, thus resisting the bias that results from a homogenous pool of sources. van Dijk (1991) underscores the need for diverse sources, Possible biases in the coverage of ethnic affairs not only reside in the selection and prominence of news actors, but also in the ways they are presented as speakers who give their interpretation of, and opinions about news events. (p. 151).   Guides fit into diversity strategies in other ways. Colorlines.com is an American daily news site that covers racial justice issues (Colorlines, n.d., About Us section, para. 1). The site provides an Immigration Stylebook that \\u201coutlines why Colorlines.com writers don't use the i-word, \\u2018illegals,\\u2019 in any form to describe people\\u201d (Colorlines, n.d., Colorline.com\\u2019s Immigration Stylebook section, para. 1). The guide is a resource for journalists looking to cover immigration fairly and accurately. Among the reasons Colorlines.com lists for dropping the i-word is the fact that the word is legally inaccurate (Colorlines, n.d., Colorline.com\\u2019s Immigration Stylebook section, para. 3). Inaccurate news reports of immigrants can have serious ramifications. Writing from a Canadian perspective, Mahtani (2008) notes, Racial minorities, and new immigrants to Canada from minority racialized groups in particular, are often presented as threats to the nation-state, and non-White groups are  16 portrayed consistently as mysterious or inscrutable, or linked invariably to crime and deviant patterns of behaviour. (p. 640)  Colorline.com\\u2019s Immigration Stylebook can aid journalists in avoiding these negative portrayals, thereby providing a more accurate and fair representation of immigrants in the news.  The Center for Integration & Improvement of Journalism\\u2019s News Watch Diversity Style Guide (n.d.) and the Media Diversity Institute\\u2019s Reporting Diversity Manual (2002) are two more guides. The former is a comprehensive list of terms compiled with the help of various ethnic media organizations and industry professionals. The latter is a series of case studies analyzing where U.S. and European newspapers went wrong in reporting diversity, and what journalists can do to fix the mistakes. Both resources act as components of media diversity strategies by providing journalists with guidelines for accurate representation of minorities in the news, of which the positive outcomes are plentiful. According to Milica Pesic, executive director of the Media Diversity Institute, As journalists, we have a unique opportunity to facilitate the process of reconciliation. We possess the ability to help all members of our communities express their needs and desires. We have the power to help eliminate stereotypes and misrepresentations of ethnic, racial and religious minorities within our societies. And we have the authority to shape the discussion and define the areas of common ground through accurate, unbiased reporting. (Tuller, 2002, p. 14)    2.3 Conceptualizing Accuracy in a Diversity Guide I opened this study with the assertion that a commitment to accuracy in journalism includes a commitment to diversity. My comment thus warrants an exploration of how to conceptualize accuracy in a guide that informs diversity in journalism.  17 The debate surrounding journalism accuracy can be framed by interrogating not only what is wrong, but also what is missing; as Nick Russell reminds us, \\u201ctruth can be distorted by omission as much as by commission\\u201d (2006, p. 38). This alternative approach to situating accuracy is particularly significant in the context of reflecting diversity in journalism, where different journalistic practices often work to silence voices outside of the mainstream. To this end, the Associated Press Managing Editors diversity committee produced a report (The National Time-Out for Diversity and Accuracy, 1999) based on the following premise, We want to accurately reflect life in our communities. If our newspapers are not inclusive enough to regularly portray the diversity of those communities, then we are presenting a fundamentally inaccurate report. That lack of accuracy undermines our journalistic credibility. (Associated Press Managing Editors, The Premise section, para. 1)  While not all participants involved in the project agreed with the premise\\u2014some felt it went too far, others thought it could be edited\\u2014the report expands the industry\\u2019s understanding of accuracy by linking diversity and credibility. In fact, of the 150 newsrooms that took part in the project, 85 reported \\u201cthat they felt reframing the issue of diversity as an issue of accuracy was an idea they wanted to continue to pursue\\u201d (Associated Press Managing Editors, Executive Summary section, para. 14).  The above report sheds light onto how to reconceptualize accuracy. Historically, inaccurate journalism has been identified by common errors: botched names and titles, typos, and misreported numbers (Silverman, 2007). While seemingly simple to correct, even slight errors can affect journalistic credibility. In fact, decades of research (Charnley, 1936; Berry, 1967; Lawrence & Grey, 1969; Scanlon, 1972; Tankard Jr. & Ryan, 1974) look at journalism accuracy in newspapers. Mitchell Charnley introduced the first method of measuring newspaper accuracy in 1936 and subsequent scholars have expanded upon his seminal work.  18 Other studies (Singletary & Lipsky, 1977; Moore & Singletary, 1985; Hanson & Wearden, 2004) address accuracy within a television context. This collection of literature demonstrates that accuracy has escaped the press to some degree since it was first measured nearly eighty years ago, a problematic reality considering two national surveys in the United States found \\u201cinaccuracy hurts the news media\\u2019s credibility\\u201d (Hanson & Wearden, 2005, p. 546).  The importance of factually accurate reports cannot be denied, and journalism that accurately reflects the diversity of communities deserves the same treatment; diversity guides provide a means to this end. For example, the Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook (SPJ, 1996- 2011) compiled by the Society of Professional Journalists promotes better sourcing to accurately reflect diversity. Colorline.com\\u2019s Immigration Stylebook (Colorlines, n.d.) urges journalists to refrain from using the term \\u201cillegal\\u201d to describe immigrants because it is legally inaccurate. The Freedom Forum\\u2019s Best Practices for Newspaper Journalists (n.d.) notes that newspapers are unfair when they lack diversity, and that, \\u201c[t]he newspapers attacking the problem most effectively are following a carefully defined strategy of best practices\\u201d (p. 45) including the requirement for reporters to have their own \\u201crainbow Rolodexes\\u201d (n.d., p. 46). What these examples demonstrate is that accuracy in a guide that informs diversity is not so much about checking for spelling or factual errors\\u2014again, that is how accuracy has been conceptualized historically\\u2014but rather, more about capturing the diversities of the communities journalists cover. In the forward to The Authentic Voice (2006), David Yarnold reflects on the measures his former employer, a newspaper, took to diversify its staff and content, clearly summarizing how accuracy can be reconceptualized in terms of diversity, We came to understand why it\\u2019s important to have a voice that authentically reflects readers or viewers: It\\u2019s a question of accuracy. All journalists want their work to be viewed as accurate\\u2026And in order for our news reports to be fundamentally accurate, we must reflect the entire community. Because if, over time, our news pages or  19 broadcasts represent only narrow segments of the community, how can we consider our work to be an accurate depiction of the places where we live? (p. xi-xii)   Scholars have suggested that Aboriginal communities have been continually misrepresented and underrepresented in journalism, thereby underscoring the need for information sources that can assist in rectifying the ongoing mistreatment; yet a survey of existing journalistic resources reveals a lack of information for accurately covering Aboriginal communities. Thus, SABAR\\u2019s guide is important because it will offer journalists a way to be more accurate in their portrayals of Aboriginal people. SABAR\\u2019s guide represents a significant\\u2014and unprecedented\\u2014step toward informing accuracy in Aboriginal reporting.  The above selection of literature provides the theoretical grounding for my own work. What this research explores are the connections among media diversity strategies, journalism guides, and reconceptualizing accuracy in a diversity guide, and how these areas of study can link together in support of accurate reflection of all minority groups, in this case through the effective implementation of SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide. Before examining these findings, however, I will first outline the methods used in this study.  20 Chapter  3: Methodology 3.1 Research Approach This study examines what a small sample of broadcast journalists suggest should be included in SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide for Aboriginal reporting, as well as informing the guide\\u2019s form and medium.  It employs qualitative research methodologies in the form of semi-structured interviews with a select group of journalists identified by SABAR in order to best inform the guide\\u2019s development. Qualitative interviews are a suitable way to investigate answering this question because they \\u201care conversations in which a researcher gently guides a conversational partner in an extended conversation\\u201d so that \\u201ceach conversation is unique, as researchers match their questions to what each interviewee knows and is willing to share\\u201d (Rubin & Rubin, p. 4). Furthermore, qualitative interviews situate the researcher in the real world and are therefore appropriate for studying things \\u201cin their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them\\u201d (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000, p. 3).  I chose to interview broadcast journalists about their perspectives on SABAR\\u2019s guide. My method was developed in conjunction with SABAR because I believe in the value of transparent methodological approaches, as proposed by Linda Tuhiwai Smith and other Aboriginal researchers. As such, my approach encompasses Aboriginal perspectives and ways of knowing, thus resisting the Western epistemological standpoint that dominates much of the research involving Aboriginal communities. This approach is intentionally influenced by Aboriginality and is often described as \\u201cdecolonizing\\u201d. Decolonizing research methods is a critical step in Aboriginal research. In the opening page of Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples (1999), Smith makes explicit the conflicted relationship  21 between Aboriginal people and research: \\u201cThe word itself, \\u2018research\\u2019, is probably one of the dirtiest words in the indigenous world\\u2019s vocabulary\\u201d (p. 1). Within an indigenous context, research is inextricably linked to colonialism because it assumes a Western cultural standpoint. More precisely, Smith writes that Western research, brings to bear, on any study of indigenous peoples, a cultural orientation, a set of values, a different conceptualization of such things as time, space and subjectivity, different and competing theories of knowledge, highly specialized forms of language, and structures of power. (p. 42)  Recognizing the position from which research has historically been conducted illuminates the ways in which Western researchers have collected knowledge about Aboriginal groups and then presented it to the West, thereby claiming authority over the people. My approach borrows heavily from the work of Aboriginal researchers, who insist that much of the research on Aboriginal people has adopted a colonial mentality (Mihesuah, 1998; Smith, 1999; Restoule, 2005) and Aboriginal communities have often been exploited in the process. I therefore aim to break away from the colonial themes that permeate Western research by respecting the value of an Aboriginal-inspired approach to this project.  3.2 Research Question My research question is: What do a small sample of broadcast journalists believe would be most valuable to include in SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide in order to produce an accessible, accurate resource to inform the depiction of Aboriginal people in journalism?  3.3 Interviews For this study I interviewed broadcast journalists from some of SABAR\\u2019s member organizations. Questions addressed themes that included the value and necessity of an  22 Aboriginal-specific resource, how SABAR\\u2019s guide compared to other journalistic guides, the types of information journalists need to accurately report on Aboriginal issues, and how this information could be most effectively presented and then delivered. I asked journalists to draw upon their personal experiences in telling Aboriginal stories, as well as their familiarity with other journalism guides, to elicit suggestions as to how the format of SABAR\\u2019s guide can be most effectively organized. As such, this study requires a flexible research technique that allows participants to expand upon areas in which they are most knowledgeable. Qualitative research scholars Herbert J. Rubin and Irene S. Rubin call this approach to interviewing semi-structured (2005, p. 4).  I interviewed eleven broadcast journalists from seven different media organizations across Canada, all SABAR members and chosen by the organization. I did not choose the interviewees myself. SABAR provided me with a list of potential interviewees.  The individuals who responded to my call for interviews worked at a variety of media organizations, including Astral Media, APTN, CBC, CTV News, Global News, OMNI, and The Weather Network. The interviews gave participants an opportunity to voice how they think the guide should be organized.  3.3.1 Participant Recruitment I interviewed participants after SABAR\\u2019s executive board recommended them to me. I drafted a letter that was distributed at a SABAR meeting in January of 2011 (see Appendix A). The letter included information about the study and asked board members to provide the contact information for two potential participants within their media organizations. I clearly  23 stated that ideally the individuals should be journalists with some experience and/or interest in Aboriginal reporting. Once I was provided with the contact information for possible interviewees I sent each journalist a formal email introducing my study and myself. I outlined the procedure and what their involvement in the project would entail. I followed up my initial message with another email or a telephone call to confirm participation. Next, an interview time was arranged with those willing to participate. In preparation for each interview I sent participants SABAR\\u2019s draft guide, as well as a consent form for their completion, as required by the University of British Columbia\\u2019s Research Ethics Board. The consent form allowed interviewees to choose between being identified in the study or remaining anonymous. Most chose to be named and those who opted for confidentiality will not be in this project. Interviews were conducted in person or on the telephone depending on the preference and location of each participant. All interviews took place in private settings.  3.3.2 Data Collection and Analysis The data in this study comes from the open-ended, semi-structured qualitative interviews I conducted with eleven broadcast journalists working for SABAR member organizations across Canada. Most interviews were approximately an hour long. I formulated a set of questions based on the objectives of my research (see Appendix C), and although I drew from the same list of questions for all the interviews, my approach was flexible enough to allow participants to focus on the issues that they found most important and spend less time on others. Each interview was recorded with the participants\\u2019 permission and then  24 transcribed for further analysis. Participants received a copy of the transcription for review within one month of the date of the interview.  After the data was collected I analyzed each transcript to identify concepts and themes that appeared throughout the interviews. A concept is \\u201ca word or term that represents an idea important to your research problem,\\u201d and themes are, \\u201csummary statements and explanations of what is going on\\u201d (Rubin & Rubin, 2005, p. 207). My method for examining the material I gathered draws upon Rubin and Rubin\\u2019s approach to coding, in which concepts and themes that arise in the interviews are labeled in accordance with a key of codes that include definitions to recognize when important issues are present in the data (2005, p. 207). The main concepts and themes that I identified are discussed in the final analysis.  3.3.3 Research Limitations No study is without research limitations and it is therefore important to recognize those present in my own. To begin, the sample size is small. While I interviewed precisely the type of person this study required\\u2014participant recruitment was not random, after all\\u2014the number was limited to eleven. A larger pool of participants would most likely yield a wider array of data. Moreover, the results are not generalizable. The guide in question deals with information related to Aboriginal people, their cultures, and their histories, and although this study examines the value guides have in ameliorating representation of minorities in the media, my findings are specific to SABAR\\u2019s guide. However, although the sample size is small, it does yield some important findings that I elaborate upon later in the thesis. My research intends to shed light on initiatives designed to accurately reflect diversity in the news media, thereby functioning as a referent for similar studies. To this end, my work is  25 modeled according to the research design laid out by Rubin and Rubin: carefully selected interviewees with special attention paid to thoroughness, accuracy and believability (2005, 64-78).                    26 Chapter  4: Findings and Discussion In this section, I summarize the key findings from interviews conducted with broadcast journalists regarding what they believe would be most valuable to include in order to produce an accessible, accurate guide to inform the depiction of Aboriginal people in journalism. I will suggest that there are three key findings: SABAR\\u2019s guide is greatly needed, journalists have ideas for what the resource should contain to support accurate Aboriginal reflection, and online access to the guide is the quickest and easiest delivery method.  4.1 SABAR\\u2019s Proposed Guide is Necessary and Long Overdue Through the course of the interviews is became evident that SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide addresses a void in information sources for journalists, suggesting that one of the key findings of this study concerned an industry-wide need for a guide that supports accurate Aboriginal reporting. This section presents reasons why SABAR\\u2019s guide is a necessary contribution to existing journalistic resources, particularly in the absence of other Aboriginal- specific guides. It concludes with an interpretation of this study\\u2019s first key finding.  4.1.1 The Guide is Needed and SABAR\\u2019s Contribution is Exciting One of the most important findings to emerge from the qualitative interviews involved the unanimous need for a guide of this nature. All the participants said that the guide is important and they were enthusiastic about using it. Curt Petrovich, a national reporter for CBC Radio News in Vancouver, British Columbia, has been reporting on Aboriginal communities for about 25 years. He explained why SABAR\\u2019s guide would make a valuable reference tool for journalists covering Aboriginal communities,  27 The truth is, in I don\\u2019t know how many newsrooms, you often have people who have never been to a First Nation, they\\u2019ve never been on a reserve, they have no sense or concept of any of this, so having [the guide] on hand would be useful for a great number of journalists, particularly junior journalists who just haven\\u2019t done this kind of coverage before (Petrovich, personal communication, April 15, 2011).  Kelly Noseworthy, a bureau correspondent for The Weather Network in Oakville, Ontario, insisted on the importance of the guide for all journalists, stating that the distribution of the guide should not be limited to SABAR members only; everyone in the industry should have access to the resource, hence emphasizing its value (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011). Journalists interviewed did not know of a comparable current resource in Canada and were excited about SABAR\\u2019s draft. Even Petrovich and Paul Barnsley, the executive producer for APTN Investigates in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said they had never seen a guide of this type (Petrovich, personal communication, April 15, 2011; Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011), a significant finding considering the two journalists have over 43 years of combined experience in Aboriginal reporting. In fact, only one participant remembered encountering a specific guide regarding Aboriginality. Jessica Lyall is a senior news writer for OMNI Television in Toronto, Ontario. She said at some point in her career she had come across Everyone\\u2019s Story: Reflecting Canada\\u2019s Diversity (2007), a user guide produced by the Radio-Television News Directors Association (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). The guide only devoted a short section to Aboriginal people and the media. Journalists need detailed information to produce news reports that are both accurate and culturally sensitive, an especially important objective in Aboriginal reporting. Noseworthy suggested:  28 I think the whole point [of the guide] is to make sure that we\\u2019re all accurate and the information is the same, because if you flip from one channel to the next I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ll see varying degrees of the same report, and who knows who is accurate and who is not. And the thing is, when you\\u2019re reporting on something like Aboriginal history or Aboriginal culture or Aboriginal religion, Aboriginal treaties and land claims and whatever, you better be accurate (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011).  Noseworthy added that SABAR\\u2019s guide could replace other resources journalists may consult when covering Aboriginal affairs, such as Internet search engines like Google: \\u201cNot everything that\\u2019s on Google is the truth, and that\\u2019s where people are getting their information from\\u201d (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011). The interview material suggests SABAR\\u2019s guide fills a void in resources for journalists covering Aboriginal affairs because it provides the comprehensive and accurate information they need.  4.1.2 The Guide Will Play a Critical Role in Training Broadcasters Another important theme that emerged during the interviews was the role SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide could play in training journalists in all stages of their careers. First, the guide could supplement a lack of training on the part of journalists. Not one of the eleven participants interviewed received any formal training or lessons in covering Aboriginal stories either at journalism school or since entering the industry. Those who were more familiar with Aboriginal people and their histories had taken it upon themselves to learn more in support of accurate journalism. One participant who wished to remain anonymous in this study is a network correspondent for a television station in Eastern Canada. She explained, I always try to sort of find, okay, what\\u2019s the right word, what do you use, and try to make it as culturally sensitive as possible and accurate. So a lot of that was just personal, and I think that that\\u2019s the problem is that you have people who may not be as dedicated to\\u2014well, not that they don\\u2019t care, they\\u2019re just busy and rushing toward a  29 deadline and they\\u2019re trying to sort of just get it done as quickly and easily as possible (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  Second, SABAR\\u2019s guide could play an important part in training new journalists. When questioned about other guides and how they learned about them, participants said that for the most part they were introduced to the guides at school or at work as part of their own training process. However, most interviewed explained to me that they were never introduced to a guide on how to cover Aboriginal communities more accurately. The implications here are tremendous. SABAR\\u2019s guide could be given to new hires as part of their introduction to a job. As a senior news writer, Lyall said she would encourage new writers to use the guide when necessary: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the type of thing that, you know, a new writer gets hired, I\\u2019m going to hand them [the guide] and say, \\u2018Listen, if you ever need to, this is what you refer to\\u2019\\u201d (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). SABAR\\u2019s guide has the opportunity to become the authoritative source on Aboriginal reporting by training new journalists ways to accurately cover stories. Third, journalists discussed the guide serving as a useful reference for providing ways to accurately reflect Aboriginality in their work, especially when they are not regularly assigned to cover Aboriginal news stories. Some of the participants explained they are general assignment reporters and are not presented with a lot of opportunities to report on Aboriginal affairs, and thus need to be reminded about the meanings of terms or the complex history of Aboriginal people in Canada. The interview material suggests that journalists are not adequately trained in the nuances of Aboriginal reporting and SABAR\\u2019s guide could help rectify these inadequacies, thereby serving as an authoritative resource in the area.    30 4.1.3 Guide Provides Necessary Context The information contained in SABAR\\u2019s guide supports journalists\\u2019 efforts to properly represent the communities they cover, with the aim that Aboriginality will be accurately reflected in their work. Journalists can tell complex stories by providing the necessary layers of context and background information. And having this type of information can advance stories. As Justine Lewkowicz, a reporter and anchor for NewsTalk 1010 in Toronto, Ontario, described, Well anytime in news that you\\u2019re covering something it\\u2019s important to have a reference point, or sort of, you know, what\\u2019s happening with Aboriginal issues in Ontario is related somehow to Aboriginal issues in Nunavut, or in BC, or whatnot. To know the background of the story is really important, to know what kinds of questions you should be asking about the issue happening right now (Lewkowicz, personal communication, March 18, 2011).  Having sufficient contextual information can also assist journalists in being respectful. A concern that journalists may cause offense toward Aboriginal people is a concept that often surfaced during the interviews. The study\\u2019s anonymous participant explained how improper language use could be offensive: I think people are, journalists in particular, are nervous about making mistakes and offending people and so they tend to use language which is either old and inaccurate or really, really safe and too wide-sweeping because they don\\u2019t want to upset people and they don\\u2019t want to be wrong (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  The anonymous participant also discussed the ramifications of improper language combined with a lack of background information when journalists are in the field talking to Aboriginal people in their own communities. She said journalists have to build trust with their sources and that \\u201cyou can\\u2019t build trust if you don\\u2019t have the proper language and you don\\u2019t understand what these communities have been through\\u201d (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011). The interviews suggest SABAR\\u2019s guide could help journalists  31 communicate the complexities of the communities they cover in ways that avoid causing offense by providing essential context.  4.1.4 Interpreting the Findings The interview material demonstrates that participants believed SABAR\\u2019s guide could assist journalists in reflecting Aboriginality more accurately. These findings are in line with a couple of the requirements that Fleras and Kunz (2001) lay out for strategies that promote a diverse and inclusive media: \\u201cbalanced and impartial newscasting and\\u2026sensitivity training for journalists and decision makers\\u201d (p. 157) The literature examining the long history of misrepresentation and underrepresentation in the media of minorities in general, and Aboriginal people in particular, underpins the need for resources like SABAR\\u2019s. Some of the participants also touched upon this routine mistreatment and they noted that SABAR\\u2019s guide is not only necessary but also long overdue. In fact, every participant said they would use the guide. Even those well versed in Aboriginal reporting showed appreciation for the resource, although they noted they might not need to use it as often as their less experienced colleagues. Above all, participants emphasized that they would be eager to see a guide like this in newsrooms, and emphatically pointed out that they would use a guide to inform their own storytelling approaches.  4.2 Content: What SABAR\\u2019s Guide Should Look Like The content of SABAR\\u2019s guide is another important theme that emerged during the interviews. While all the journalists interviewed were enthusiastic about the draft document, they still had ideas for how the guide could be improved to further inform accurate  32 Aboriginal depiction in their work. Participants discussed additions to the guide and explained how the added content could help them. They also talked about the most effective ways of presenting the information so as many of their colleagues as possible would use the guide. This section presents what journalists think SABAR\\u2019s guide should look like. It ends with an interpretation of the second key finding.  4.2.1 Journalists Want a List of Aboriginal Contacts An important finding that surfaced during the interviews is that journalists want a list of contacts within Aboriginal communities to inform the development of a story. Many journalists said the list would help them locate the best sources for a story, an important consideration when attempting to accurately capture the diversities of Aboriginal people. As the anonymous participant described, Journalists tend to have very, very tight deadlines, they often need information quickly, and so they might make a phone call and it could go to an old voicemail that\\u2019s incorrect, that\\u2019s the number that\\u2019s listed, and then no one calls them back by their deadline, and then the information that goes to print or on air isn\\u2019t as up-to-date or as accurate as it could be (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  Laurel Clark, a television reporter for Global Edmonton in Alberta, talked about how journalists can provide better coverage of Aboriginal people by tapping into contacts on a local scale, If we were to have a list of experts and contacts at the community level, that would be great because those people, you know, you might not think of calling them but you call them up and then you get some great story, some success story\\u2026and then you\\u2019re offering more balanced coverage (Clark, personal communication, March 25, 2011).  Carol Charles is a reporter and video journalist for CTV News Toronto in Ontario. She also said would like a list of contacts added to the guide. She said if she needed to speak  33 to someone to address her questions or concerns, or if she required clarification, a contact list would provide quick and easy access to the applicable sources (Charles, personal communication, March 17, 2011). Including a list of contacts in SABAR\\u2019s guide would assist journalists in accurate Aboriginal reflection by offering a range of diverse voices. Furthermore, because the list would be compiled by SABAR, those journalists referencing it could be confident that the contacts listed are considered by SABAR to be authorities in their respective areas.  4.2.2 Suggested Additions All of the journalists interviewed suggested additions to SABAR\\u2019s guide that would assist them in accurately reflecting Aboriginality in their work, the most common of which included maps and pronunciation guides. While participants usually explained their reasoning for these two additions it should be noted that they were both included in the original question (see Appendix A for the list of questions), and my own suggestion may have influenced the responses. Having acknowledged that, a review of these suggested additions, and others, is necessary.  As mentioned above, maps were a common addition suggested by journalists. Rob Smith is a reporter and video journalist for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) in Vancouver, British Columbia. He said he would like to see the addition of several kinds of maps, Certainly maps would be helpful, not only traditional territory maps but language- grouping maps, political tribal council maps, you know, because you have your First Nations but then you have your tribal councils which comprise up to 14 or 15 First Nations here in B.C., so to see their territory complete would be good. In fact, I want one of those to hang up, I want to be able to see it (Smith, personal communication, April 11, 2011).  34  Barnsley also said different types of maps would be helpful. He said he knows people working in television have been trying to create a comprehensive map showing all the First Nations and reserves in Canada, but lacking sufficient time and resources, they have not been able to complete one (Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011). Maps like those discussed by Smith and Barnsley are useful tools for situating Aboriginal people in Canada and for educating journalists and their audiences.  Correct pronunciation is critical in broadcast journalism and participants were enthusiastic about adding pronunciation guides to SABAR\\u2019s guide. Just like improper language use, mispronouncing names, places, and other kinds of terms is inaccurate and can offend people. As Noseworthy explained, making sure journalists have proper pronunciation is a \\u201ckey element\\u201d in accurate Aboriginal reflection (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011). Additionally, Lyall said that at OMNI Television she consistently has other broadcast journalists asking her how to pronounce words, and SABAR\\u2019s guide could help (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  Some journalists suggested adding specific terms and websites to the guide. Marie Wadden is a radio producer for the CBC Network in St. John\\u2019s, Newfoundland. She recommended adding the term \\u201cecocentric\\u201d or \\u201cecologically centric\\u201d (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011). Both Wadden and Lyall said that \\u201cInnu\\u201d should be added as a standalone term (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011; Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). The Innu are Naskapi and Montagnais First Nations people who live in Northern Quebec and Labrador. They are often confused with Inuit, but the two groups are distinct. In the draft guide a note appears under Inuvialuit that briefly describes  35 this confusion, but Innu is not actually listed as a term itself. Wadden and Lyall noticed this and suggested it could be added to the glossary.  Other journalists talked about adding the websites for Aboriginal political and leadership organizations to SABAR\\u2019s guide. Smith named the websites for the First Nations Summit (www.fns.bc.ca) and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs (www.ubcic.bc.ca) as important additions (Smith, personal communication, April 11, 2011). Similarly, Wadden said she would like to see websites for the Assembly of First Nations (www.afn.ca), Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (www.itk.ca), Pauktuutit (www.pauktuutit.ca), and the M\\u00e9tis National Council (www.metisnation.ca) listed in the guide (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011). These websites offer even more information pertaining to Aboriginal people than is contained in SABAR\\u2019s guide, thus providing journalists with further resources that support accurate Aboriginal reflection in the news media. While all participants said they found SABAR\\u2019s guide to be a valuable resource for Aboriginal reporting, the interviews suggested that additional information could be added to increase the guide\\u2019s helpfulness.  4.2.3 Presenting the Guide\\u2019s Content Journalists must work quickly and effectively to meet their deadlines. Some participants suggested categorizing the information in SABAR\\u2019s guide according to themes to facilitate usability. (Participants also described these categorizes as sections, chapters, and headings.) Suggestions for categories included religion, politics, culture, and basic terms. Clark said this would make the guide easier to use, One thought that I had was maybe instead of putting terms in alphabetical order you could have them under headings. So for example, you could have one for \\u2018Culture,\\u2019 and under \\u2018Culture\\u2019 you could have terms like \\u2018Dream Catcher,\\u2019 \\u2018Eagle Feather,\\u2019 that kind of thing\\u2026because I felt as I was going through [the guide] that I was interested  36 in and curious about the terms but I wonder if I\\u2019m a reporter and I\\u2019m writing something and I\\u2019m on deadline it might be more helpful if it\\u2019s organized in a way where it\\u2019s under headings (Clark, personal communication, March 25, 2011).  The terms could then be listed alphabetically within each category to further support usability. However, not all participants agreed that the guide should be categorized according to themes. The anonymous participant discussed the pitfalls of the idea: \\u201cSometimes you\\u2019re dealing with situations where some reporters, again, who might be kind of new to this, might now know what theme they\\u2019re trying to be looking at\\u201d (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  4.2.4 How Content Can Support Accuracy and Authority Providing up-to-date content is an important component of accuracy in terms of a journalism guide. This is significant within the context of SABAR\\u2019s guide as government legislation can\\u2014and has\\u2014changed the terminology used to describe Aboriginal people and their diverse cultures. To this end, participants agreed that SABAR\\u2019s guide should be updated regularly to make journalists confident that they are accessing the most accurate content\\u2014and to ensure journalists continue using the guide. Participants discussed different time intervals for updating a hardcopy guide and a digital version. Most said that the former should be updated annually and the latter whenever there is a significant change to its contents, thereby making the digital version more current than even the latest paper guide. Additionally, the contents of SABAR\\u2019s guide sets an industry standard for accurate terminology and usage, thereby creating the opportunity for the guide to become the leading resource for Aboriginal reporting. But Wadden explained that if SABAR\\u2019s guide is to reach this level of authority then leading media organizations must recognize it.  37 I would use the guidebook if, for example, I knew that SABAR\\u2019s guidebook had been approved by all the journalistic leaders, like The [Canadian] Press, then I would use it because I would know that this was standard and accepted practice by all the newspapers, you know, so you need to get a stamp, you need to get consensus I think from The Canadian Press and the media leaders. You know, once they all say, oh yeah right, well that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re going to consider our accepted usage too, then journalists are more likely to use the book (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011).  Lyall said that if SABAR\\u2019s guide could garner the type of recognition like that described by Wadden then it \\u201cbecomes the source, and you don\\u2019t really look anywhere else\\u201d (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). She also said that recognition from government bodies and Aboriginal organizations like the Assembly of First Nations would further support the guide\\u2019s authority.  4.2.5 Interpreting the Findings This finding is an indication of what journalists think SABAR\\u2019s guide should look like in order to improve coverage of Aboriginal people. de Uriarte (2003) claims that \\u201c[t]he best resource for better coverage is greater familiarity about Latinos and other minorities on the part of the press\\u201d (p. 58). The journalists I interviewed echoed this claim within an Aboriginal context, and they provided suggestions for what the guide could contain to promote familiarity with Aboriginal people.  4.3 Delivery: Accessing SABAR\\u2019s Guide Access to the guide was important to many of the journalists interviewed, suggesting that one of the key findings involved ease of use and online availability. In fact, every participant said they would access the guide online and most said they would prefer a digital version to a hardcopy. Interviews still demonstrated support for a printed version, but as  38 traditional forms of journalism (newspapers, TV news, and radio programs) have moved online, it seems that is where journalistic resources should be heading as well. This section presents reasons why journalists advocated for a digital guide, while also providing rationale for the production of a hardcopy. It closes with an interpretation of this study\\u2019s final key finding.  4.3.1 Online Resources are Quick, Easy and Accessible A common theme throughout the interviews was that journalists have to find information quickly and easily in response to a perpetual cycle of deadlines. While a hardcopy guide may contain the required information, searching through a book can waste valuable time.  Petrovich suggested building an online guide around a search function to make locating information as quick as possible, We have to be able to have an answer after hitting one enter key on a computer or on a smartphone. So that would be my thing, if there was a way to make it more instant rather than, say, flipping or scrolling through something (Petrovich, personal communication, April 15, 2011).  Other journalists touched upon the connection between an online resource and ease of use. Angie Seth is the lead news anchor for OMNI News: South Asian Edition in Toronto, Ontario. She had this to say: We are at our computers, we are at the mercy of technology every single day, and sadly gone are the days where we grab something from our bookshelf and go through it. But if we had something that was online that was a quick reference it would be easier for us to lookup (Seth, personal communication, May 6, 2011).  The interview material suggests that an online guide would be quicker and easier to use than a hardcopy, hence the overwhelming support for a digital format.  39  An online version of the guide doesn\\u2019t just make searching and finding information quick and easy, it also makes that information readily accessible by allowing journalists to consult the guide anywhere they have access to the Internet. Lewkowicz provided the following explanation for her preference for an online guide, When I\\u2019m working sometimes I\\u2019m in the newsroom, sometimes I\\u2019m working off my laptop, sometimes I\\u2019m working off my BlackBerry, so if I\\u2019m not on the right computer that has the file, or if I can\\u2019t get access to my email, I can easily just go to a URL, here\\u2019s where the guidebook is, so definitely online (Lewkowicz, personal communication, March 18, 2011).  In fact, like Lewkowicz, most study participants said they use some sort of smartphone (BlackBerry, iPhone) for work, so a digital version of the guide would literally put the information at their fingertips. Moreover, many of the journalists saw benefit in an online website that would be compatible with their mobile devices. This is particularly valuable for reporters who often work on the road. Charles says she spends up to 70 per cent of her time outside the newsroom, so having portable and easy access to the information in the guide is \\u201ckey\\u201d (Charles, personal communication, March 17, 2011). Barnsley said \\u201csmartphones are the way to go\\u201d (Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011). When questioned about the usefulness of a smartphone-compatible version of the guide he said, \\u201cIt would certainly work for our company and I have a feeling it would work for other media organizations as well\\u201d (Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011). The interview material suggests that journalists prefer the format that allows them to access information the quickest and with the most ease, and it seems a digital version would best support these requirements.  Despite the preference of most journalists for an online version of SABAR\\u2019s guide, many participants suggested that a hardcopy version would still be crucial. Also, SABAR\\u2019s  40 guide is intended to assist journalists in Aboriginal reporting, and given the remote locations of many Aboriginal communities, readily available Internet access must not be taken for granted. A paper version of the guide is accessible anywhere, and may prove especially beneficial depending on where exactly journalists go in their jobs. This suggests that access to the guide should not depend upon access to the Internet.  4.3.2 Interpreting the Findings This research finding provides a better understanding of how journalists would like to access SABAR\\u2019s guide in their jobs. The interview material suggests that resources that are the quickest and easiest to use are the ones preferred by most journalists, and in today\\u2019s technology-driven media environment it seems those resources are usually digital. As evidence of this claim, in 2008 The Canadian Press launched online versions of its bestselling guides, The Canadian Press Stylebook and Caps and Spelling, thereby mirroring the general transition of journalism from its traditional forms to its digital counterparts. While SABAR\\u2019s guide should also be available online, the value of a hardcopy must not be overlooked. Journalists need access to information that supports accurate Aboriginal depiction and that access should not be limited by the guide\\u2019s method of delivery.        41 Chapter  5: Conclusion The results of this study provide insight into the value of a journalism guide designed to more accurately reflect Aboriginal people and their communities. The most important finding in this study is that there is a significant need for this resource. SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide can serve accurate Aboriginal reflection by functioning as a unique and authoritative reference document for journalists. Participants indicated that they would use the guide themselves and that they also considered it a beneficial resource to keep in their newsrooms and/or distribute as part of training for new journalists. Journalists suggested that the guide would fill a void in the selection of journalism guides currently available. Moreover, it supplements a significant lack of training on the part of journalists. It is paramount to note that not one of the eleven study participants received any formal training or lessons in Aboriginal reporting at journalism school or since entering the industry. Participants saw the guide as a necessary and long overdue journalistic resource. Questions of how to ensure as many people as possible will use the guide inevitably led to discussions of ways to access the guide quickest and easiest. Participants provided suggestions for reformatting the resource but what became evident throughout the course of the interviews is that the best solution seems to be an online guide. The theoretical framework presented at the outset of this study helps make sense of the findings. Reflections of Aboriginality in the news have a long history of inaccuracies, the results of which often cast Aboriginal people in a negative light (Alia, 1999; Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2000 & 2002; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Mahtani, 2001; Meadows, 1994). This is, of course, problematic. Journalism that does not accurately reflect the  42 diversities of Aboriginal people disavows the core values of journalistic integrity (Morgan, Pifer, & Woods, 2006). This study examines what information Canadian broadcast journalists need to report on Aboriginal issues more accurately, but some questions remain unanswered. The biggest one, perhaps, is whether a guide for Aboriginal reporting is sufficient in rectifying the ongoing misrepresentation of Aboriginality in the news. While SABAR\\u2019s terminology guide is a valuable and necessary resource, there is an obvious need for more information in journalism schools as well as the industry on the history of Aboriginal people in Canada. This was clearly demonstrated by the lack of training participants received on Aboriginal reporting in school or since entering the industry. Future research projects should explore the educational opportunities for journalists in the area of Aboriginal reporting in particular, and racialized groups in general. Another unanswered question involves determining what form the guide will eventually take. Participants demonstrated unanimous support for an online guide but many still indicated they would like to see a hardcopy version as well. Most of the media diversity strategies reviewed in this project are online resources, and this is likely an indication of where journalists routinely go for their information. Indeed, much of the industry has migrated online, so the fact that journalism resources are following is not surprising. Future studies of media diversity strategies should pay particular attention to how initiatives are accessed. An additional important area of study is determining how guides like SABAR\\u2019s get recognized as valuable reference documents. Participants said if SABAR\\u2019s guide is to serve as the industry standard for Aboriginal reporting then industry leaders like The Canadian  43 Press, government bodies, and Aboriginal organizations like the Assembly of First Nations must accept it as an authoritative source. Unfortunately, participants did not provide ways in which the guide could be recognized. Future studies should explore how media diversity strategies can gain this recognition, as the interview material suggests that acceptance by key organization (be it media, government or Aboriginal) is a critical component of producing an authoritative resource. Academic analyses in the field of media and minority relations have often relied on content analysis, focusing on the ongoing misrepresentation and underrepresentation of racialized groups through quantitative analyses of journalistic products like newspaper articles or broadcast news items. As a result, academics have not fully engaged with the producers themselves necessarily, nor have they asked how their research projects can ultimately lead to progressive social change within media institutions. This project attempted to bridge that gap, by asking what kind of research project could be designed and implemented that would best inform the development of a useful guide for journalists. The epistemological implications of this study shed light on the relationship between Aboriginal people and the media specifically, and on critical journalism more broadly.         44 References Abel, S.

My name is Jessica Michielin and I am a Masters student in my final year at the University of British Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism. I am assisting SABAR with its key terminologies guidebook project. My participation in this research study is also the basis of my thesis.  I am interested in asking journalists about the most effective way of communicating the information in SABAR\\u2019s key terminologies guidebook to those likely to use it. To this end, can you please provide me with the contact information for two potential participants within your organization? Ideally these individuals will be journalists with some experience and/or interest in covering Aboriginal stories as this research aims to explore how SABAR\\u2019s guidebook can best assist in accurately reflecting Aboriginality in the news.  I will be conducting 1-2 hour interviews. Depending on what is most convenient for each participant, interviews can be done in person or over the phone. Participants will also need to familiarize themselves with the most current draft of the guidebook beforehand.  While participating broadcasters will be gratefully acknowledged, the names of individual participants will be kept completely confidential if interviewees wish to remain anonymous.  I thank you in advance for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards, Jessica Michielin 1.778.994.8465 jmic@interchange.ubc.ca       53 Appendix B  List of Interview Questions  Semi-Structured Interview Question List  Objective: To determine how to best put SABAR's guidebook to use  What were your first impressions of the guidebook?  When would you use it?  -What would make it easier for you to use?  What changes to the current layout would make the guidebook most useful?  Besides key terminologies, what else could the guidebook include that would assist you in accurately reflecting Aboriginality in your work (ex. maps, list of First Nations, pronunciation guides, treaties and treaty information)?  What additional terms and/or websites would you recommend adding to the guidebook?  Would you consult the guidebook if it were available online?  -Which format would you prefer: hardcopy or digital?  How often should the guide be updated so you are confident that you are getting the most accurate information?  Is there anything else I haven\\u2019t asked you about the guidebook that you\\u2019d like to bring to my attention?   Objective: To gauge participants' prior experience with guidebooks like SABAR's  Have you encountered any journalism guidebooks in your career?  -How did you discover them?  -How do they compare to SABAR's?  -How often did you use them?  -How effective were they?  -Were they specific to Aboriginal peoples (vs. a multicultural scope)?  How valuable have similar guidebooks been to your work?  Can you share an example of when a similar guidebook assisted you in telling an Aboriginal story?  -Why was the guide helpful?   54 In the absence of a similar guidebook, what other resources have you consulted when telling Aboriginal stories?   Objective: To gauge range of participants' experiences in covering Aboriginal stories  What is your experience with covering Aboriginal stories?  -Have you encountered any challenges? -What were the challenges? -How did you respond? -Have you used any resources to assist you in telling Aboriginal stories?  -What were the resources? -Do you consult Aboriginal sources? -What medium(s) of journalism has/have been most effective in telling these stories? -What mediums has/have been least effective? -Have your past experiences taught you anything specific that you have since used when covering Aboriginal stories?  -What did you learn?  What do you do now in your current job?  How long have you been working as a journalist?  When you were trained as a journalist, did you ever receive any formal training or lessons in covering Aboriginal stories?\"\n",

This came as a bit of a shock to me.  We spend a lot of time in the study of media bloviating over definitions. What is journalism? What is its purpose? In a world of freelancers and bloggers and commentators, who, then, is a journalist? These are difficult questions, not because we don’t know journalism when we see it, but because it is not exactly easy to come up with a definition broad enough to include everyone whom we feel intuitively belongs, while still managing to exclude those we feel do not.  In an essay I wrote for a media ethics course in February of 2011, I strongly criticized Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel for the following phrase, which is prominent in the introduction to their book on media ethics: “The primary purpose of journalism is to provide citizens with the information they need to be free and self-governing” (2007, 12).  2  This is a nice thought, I wrote, but I don’t feel it to be very fair to sports reporters -- I don’t place an inordinate amount of value in what they do, but I’ll defend to the death their right to call themselves journalists. Same goes for food writers, gossip columnists, and paparazzi. I suppose that means that I fall on the expansive side of the journalism-definition debate.  But here is Adrienne Arsenault, undoubtedly one of Canada’s media stars, saying that for her the point of journalism is to make people care about wars in countries they’ll never visit. That certainly doesn’t include sports writers either, but I really dig it. What gives? Am I just a hypocrite?  Well, maybe. But the point, which shocked me then and seems incredibly obvious now, is that journalism is complicated and can serve a variety of purposes. There might be one big, articulable idea out there that covers all of them, but there doesn’t need to be, and it might not even matter either way. A corollary to this is that working journalists don’t necessarily need to know the answers to the big questions to do their jobs ethically, effectively and with purpose. Indeed, when considering topics of research in the field of media, it seems clear that the more specialized the question, the more likely it is to be applicable to real journalistic work.  We’ll come back to this. But let’s shift topics for a bit to the question of sources.  Journalists quote sources when producing news. It is a relationship so basic as to defy notice, 3  but like most elements of an enterprise as epistemologically complex as reporting, closer scrutiny yields a wealth of complexity.  I got to thinking about the relationship between journalists and sources in the wake of “Message Machine,” a 2008 article by David Barstow in the New York Times. Barstow wrote about a Pentagon program that briefed retired military officers on the administration’s policies and plans; those officers would then appear regularly on radio and television news programs as “military analysts.” The result was an effective dissemination of the Pentagon’s media messages into the public conversation on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but through the mouths of ostensibly neutral commentators. Many of the analysts partook because of “ideological and military allegiances,” and some had ties to defence contractors that stood to profit from a prolonged war effort (Barstow 2008).  The analysts were presented as experts, individuals with specific knowledge relevant to the discussion. Reasonable enough; on the topic of military conflicts, retired military officers are a natural source choice. Certainly in a world of spin, counter-spin and duelling pundits, “expertise” seems like exactly what the media needs more of. Indeed, there is nothing particular in the Barstow piece to indicate that the sources lacked knowledge; they really were experts, but they had also participated in a program, or had financial interests, that called their credibility as neutral sources of information into question.  4  Leaving aside the rather clearer-cut issue of undisclosed financial entanglements, that this Pentagon program caused a scandal shows how both the public and the media itself expect “expert” sources in the news to be held to different standards than those who are explicitly framed as advocates for a political position or faction (Page et al. 1987, 35-36). It is not really in question that a Republican operative, for example, called to comment on the Bush administration’s policy in Iraq might have had any amount of contact with the Pentagon. It is simply not an issue.  Given the principles of loyalty that members of the military are expected to internalize, I think there is probably some interesting research to be done into whether or not a retired officer could ever be portrayed as purely objective; indeed, it is an open theoretical question as to whether any source can.  This study is not about the peculiar difficulties inherent in military sources, however, so much as the question of how expertise is portrayed and adjudicated in the media. To examine this in detail I would like to turn to quotations from a segment of society much more familiar to both me and, I presume, my readers. For just as quoting from the military presents clear concerns, so too does using academics as sources -- this thesis will attempt to identify some of the specific concerns and practices surrounding scholarly sources. And getting back to the idea that I would like to do research that produces results with immediate applicability to journalistic tasks, it will also attempt to relate those concerns to coverage of a particular area of interest for me: 5  American politics.  Though I feel that pairing it inextricably with the idea of promoting freedom and self- governance is problematic, the basic idea of informing the public put forward by Kovach and Rosenstiel (2007, 12), and countless scholars before and since, is sensible. To speak normatively, though one who informs the public may not necessarily be a journalist, journalists should, in the course of their duties, inform the public (Lippmann 1922, XXIV).  In the area of politics this is particularly relevant, since the basic functions of a democratic system rely on an informed voting public. It seemed to me as I started this project that the role of experts is that of explaining complex concepts related to policy, from a standpoint based more in the scientific method than overt partisanship.  Since digging into the literature surrounding the use of sources I have come to think that I was somewhat mistaken. It is now my belief that the role of expert voices in the popular press is often less to provide informational content than to leverage the source’s authority. So the quality of neutrality is not subordinate to expertise, it is in fact a requirement for a journalistic source to be treated as an “expert” as opposed to as an advocate or some other type of stakeholder in the news. In other words, that experts are external to the story is not an incidental quality of expert sources, but core to the role they play.  6  Being outside the story is a source of credibility, because it means that experts are assumed to be if not unbiased then at least without specific personal entanglements that might colour their opinions on the topics of discussion; this combined with some presumed amount of relevant knowledge is a potent formula for persuasion, one that can raise or lower a proposed piece of policy considerably in the public’s regard (Page et al. 1987, 39).  Reporters will sometimes, inevitably, label as “experts” sources who do not fit these criteria, sometimes by accident and sometimes, as in the Barstow military analyst story, when they are either deceived or choose to withhold information that would exclude their source due to unacceptable partisan ties. This is significant because it can lead to information entering the public discourse with more credibility than had the source been portrayed accurately.  This is precisely what the well-trodden journalistic doctrines of honesty and verification are meant to combat, of course. But reading through the history of climate change and public health media coverage, it seems clear that the realities of news reporting procedures have allowed grave, systematic errors to enter the public discourse (Allan 2009; Boykoff 2007a; Hoggan and Littlemore 2009; Oreskes and Conway 2010).  Academic knowledge is by no means exempted from these errors; indeed, most of the deceptive coverage introduced by Hoggan, Oreskes et al. stems from manipulation of academic credentials and public misapprehension about the nature of scientific knowledge (Oreskes and 7  Conway 2010, 267-268). Other errors creep into the discourse by way of an overemphasis by journalists on organizational prestige (Conrad 1999, 290-291).  But unlike other varieties of expertise, the institutional backing of academia has a built-in mechanism for credibility, namely the system of peer-review. Unlike degrees or administrative positions, the completion of peer-reviewed research indicates, with some certainty, that others in the same field, themselves also the authors of peer-reviewed research, see the researcher’s scholarship as intellectually and academically sound (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269).  This is not to pretend that peer-review is in any way flawless; indeed the process has decidedly mixed reviews from the community it exists to support (Henderson 2010, 738), and has been subject to such critiques for a great many years (Mahoney 1977). For the purposes of this project, though, it is less important that peer review be perfect than that it be the mechanism through which academic credibility is adjudicated within the academic community itself -- at least journalists quoting scholars can then claim to be faithfully portraying academic consensus if they disclose their sources’ peer-review credentials.  Broadly speaking, then, this project will look into the tactics journalists writing about a major policy issue in the United States, health care reform, used to frame academic sources in the debates in 1993-1994 and 2009-2010. What were the tactics used to introduce and quote academic sources? Were readers of the New York Times during the periods analyzed adequately 8  informed as to who in the academic community was assigned expertise and why? What are the ramifications of the framing techniques currently in use for public policy discourse?  There are, conversely, several important issues this project does not address; it refrains from grappling with the more fundamental question of whether academic expertise is well-suited to explicating the health care debate, or indeed any other issue of complex public policy, in the news. It also does not address the relative merits or different journalistic applications of practical, on-the-ground expertise versus scholastic knowledge – there is a large and growing body of work showing that classic academic modes of inquiry can sometimes undermine much older, though less codified, bodies of knowledge, while simultaneously coming to less sound conclusions (Davis, 2005). Just as pressingly, even when its data is good academia has proven itself often unable to effectively communicate its findings because it has difficulty as an institution engaging in discourse with other forms of knowledge (Wynne, 1992).  I should note as well that the framing techniques I will be looking for in this project lie outside those laid out in the manuals of style that constitute the basic standards by which reporters operate. Beyond rules for the abbreviation of degrees and titles, The Associated Press stylebook and briefing on media law notes only that an academic degree might be mentioned to “establish someone’s credentials” (Goldstein 2002, 5, 207).  The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage contains only guidelines on when to refer to a source with the title of “Dr.” (Siegal and Connolly 1999, 111) as opposed to “Professor” (1999, 270) or “Professor Emeritus” 9  (1999, 120), and notes that to establish authority, sources will ideally be introduced by their names and titles (1999, 32-33). Though certainly nothing in these guidelines would prohibit more informative framing of sources, I do not wish to imply negligence on the part of the reporters or editors whose articles in my sample met the existing professional standards of their industry; it is rather to those standards’ inadequacy that I wish to draw attention.  Finally, this project excludes scholastic knowledge from beyond the academy, such as think tank or government research, unless that knowledge is produced in tandem with clearly framed academic institutions or actors. Insofar as these types of research follow much the same rules and by many of the same people as in academia, and are thus subject to all the same problems, this is a somewhat artificial distinction. I have chosen to make it because non-academic scholarship lacks both a consistent relationship to peer-review processes and the assumption of objectivity that I feel is key to how academics are perceived in reporting.   Acknowledging these concerns, though, I have chosen to address herein only the narrower question of, practically, how academic knowledge itself was adjudicated in this date and topic range.  10  Methodology  This study will attempt to examine the techniques by which academic frames are established, with an eye for how adeptly reporters tap into the specific safeguards academia provides for accountability. This lies in the presence of key identifiers that show credibility within the institution of academia, namely the subject’s peer reviewed research in an appropriate area of study and the currency of their research (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 231; Oreskes and Conway 2010, 272).  This type of analysis has not, to my knowledge, been done in the past. This is not to put on airs, it is simply that I do not believe this narrow technique has been applied to the use of academic sources in policy debates, as it certainly has in examining coverage of science. The question of how to sample is thus less pressing than it might be otherwise; the primary goal of this study is simply to dig in to some data. However, in the interest of procuring a range of results, I have elected to sample from two very similar policy debates in two very different media environments. To be clear, the purpose in this selection is thus not to isolate a sample that is necessarily broadly representative, but instead to generate data on one that is intrinsically interesting: coverage by the United States of America’s preeminent newspaper of one of the country’s great policy debates.  The decision to examine both 1993 and 2009 initially hinged on curiosity as to what, if any, broad differences might become apparent in two debates that were in many ways 11  extraordinarily similar (Blendon and Benson 2009, 1) yet which took place in two very different media environments. Most particularly, they fall before and after the advent of internet news. However, as few systemic differences in the data were discovered, this vector of analysis was left largely by the wayside.  I mined articles for data about the academic sources they used, especially upon a source’s introduction. The following were documented: source’s names, institutional affiliations and positions, academic disciplines, specific topics of study or explanations of actual research projects performed, if that research was current, if it was peer reviewed (either in a scholarly journal or through presentation at a convention), and its source of funding.  Information about quotations directly from academic research, bypassing the authors entirely, was also collected.  12  Literature review Epistemological categories of journalistic data - why do we need sources?  Drawing on a series of interviews, Peter Conrad writes that most science journalists feel that “they themselves can usually articulate the points more clearly in the story” than the sources they interview (199, 292). So what function do quotations from experts play in a news story at all? The answer lies in the fundamentals of journalistic practice: how journalists manage and convey different types of knowledge.  In Public Opinion, Walter Lippmann notes a distinction between reporting on events that can be accurately recorded and on those that cannot. On subjects like stock prices or the scores of sports matches where there are clear records, he says, “the modern news service moves with great precision”, whereas on matters that cannot be comprehensively recorded its efforts are less reliable and more prone to criticism. As an example he mentions the 1921 Dempsey- Carpentier world championship boxing match, wherein observers initially differed as to which blow knocked-out Carpentier, before moving pictures removed any doubt (1922, XXIII.2).  So Lippmann highlights a difference between topics on which no observer will disagree, because they are apparent and recordable, and those which require some manner of interpretation or recollection and thus are prone to differences of opinion. He notes a variety of reasons why a given event might not be recorded, including censorship, privacy, neglect, or the 13  lack of “an objective system of measurement” (Lippmann 1922, XXIII.2). In all these situations news is not a simple transmission of observed facts, but instead amounts to the construction of a narrative based on subjective perceptions and available data, and thus subject to a variety of concerns about bias and accuracy. The sum of these concerns, of course, broadly comprises a significant portion of media theory, as journalists and academics attempt to identify the personal and structural biases which are interwoven through all but the simplest reporting.  Likewise there are many issues where records, no matter how complete and perfect, will never fully convey inarguable factivity. An example Lippmann raises is that of a labour dispute; no matter how full a reporter’s knowledge, even the simple statement that work conditions were “bad” can only be made authoritative by a prohibitively large investment of time and resources. And the results of such an investigation would be massive, far too lengthy and complex to have been included in a newspaper column of the day (Lippmann 1922, XXIII.3). Even today, with space concerns lessened by the advent of internet publication, it is still unrealistic to expect readers to wade through thousands of words of exposition to defend simple judgements.  Gaye Tuchman reaffirms that this Lippmann ideology of objectivity is still in effect more than 50 years later in her 1978 book Making News, where she writes that “for newsworkers (as for scientists), having witnessed an occurrence is not sufficient to define one’s observation as factual” (1978, 82-83). When this is the case a reporter cannot simply register his or her own observations but must rely on third parties, or sources, for input. Tuchman calls the assemblage 14  of quotations to cover a lack of verifiable fact the “web of facticity”, whereby what is true is relocated to the utterance of a source -- that is to say, even when a reporter cannot write authoritatively that a thing is true, she can still definitively state that someone else said that it was (1978, 90).  From a theory of knowledge perspective, then, sources aren’t merely providers of information; they are necessary for corroboration even when the journalist herself already knows the facts. Within a journalism that pays credence to objectivity, sources are “an essential form of evidence” (Carlson 2009, 527).  Sometimes, if the reporter considers a source to be prominent enough, a statement might be considered newsworthy no matter whether it is true or not; the utterances of the powerful are often treated as news in and of themselves (Gans 1979, 241). In most other circumstances, though, a reporter, or his or her editors, will probably attempt to determine if something a source has said is true. For example, when a surgeon describes to a journalist the steps of a new procedure, or a witness to a crime relates what he or she saw, the statements produced will usually be of limited scope and thus evaluable, at least in theory, as true or false. In some of these cases, such as that of the witness, normal news practice might require further investigation to confirm what the source has said, particularly if it is controversial or potentially libellous (Tuchman 1978, 84). In other cases, like that of the surgeon, the broad metric of common sense will allow a source’s claims to be taken at face value. In some cases the 15  assembled facts might even reinforce each other, such as several witness accounts (Tuchman 1978, 86). But in all these instances, the utterance can ultimately be judged either true or false. When the facts are verifiable, it might be argued that the reliability of the source, or how likely their utterances are generally to be true, is of little import beyond the accuracy of the specific statements that they have made.  But not all statements are easily verified, and many are not verifiable at all. There are issues which are abstract (e.g. future trends), technical (e.g. scientific experiments), or both (e.g. scientific theories). Moreover, there are statements that have little or no informational content that can be verified, yet are still of interest to reporters (e.g. “This is really important.” or “This is a terrible idea.”). Many issues and statements like this require not the simple conveyance of already known factual information by a source but instead active evaluation or interpretation -- for example when an economist prescribes policy adjustments based on employment statistics or a sociologist encapsulates the state of the nation’s school-system as “good” or “terrible” (exactly the function which Lippmann writes a reporter may not perform herself; 1922, XXIII.3). In these cases, a source’s comments might be more or less reliable, depending on their level of expertise and their biases among a bevy of other potential concerns, but they won’t be simply true or false (Lippmann 1922, XIV.2).  We can thus see a stratum of types of knowledge, from the simplest facts, reportable via first- hand observation, to the most complex topics, navigable only with the help of expert sources. 16  The former answers the question “what happened?”, which is easily answerable by the press but of limited use to the public (Lippmann 1922, XXIII.3), while the latter might be a response to “what does this mean?”, which is more valuable but also far more difficult (Lippmann 1922, XXIV). It is primarily the latter sort of knowledge that necessitates the use of expert sources to convey information to the public by way of the news. How expert analysis fits into the news  Though between them Tuchman and Lippmann provide the epistemological tools to define it, both have qualms about the role of expert analysis in news. Lippmann writes that such endeavours are most successful when they operate in tandem with social institutions to disentangle issues, clearly represent concerned interests, and present objective criteria for their evaluation, but he records doubts about reporters’ ability in their routines to do justice to complex issues. He alleges that a model of the press that attempts to much, “charged with translating the whole public life of mankind” is “bound to fail” (Lippmann 1922, XXIV). Tuchman meanwhile writes that she does not believe that news routines can easily overcome their predisposition to privilege legitimated social institutions in marshalling sources, resulting in wide-spread systemic bias that is unhelpful to public discourse (1978, 4-5 91).  Without minimizing these concerns, for the next step towards describing the function of expert analysis in news we can turn back to Conrad. As mentioned above, Conrad writes that most science journalists believe that they are better able in most cases to explicate specific scientific 17  points in their own words than through those of a source (1999, 292). Expert quotes are instead used primarily to contextualize a study by explaining why it is important or even that it is important in the first place, to add legitimacy to the findings of a study by putting personal or institutional weight behind it, to describe the implications of a study, or to provide a balancing perspective (Conrad 1999, 296-298).  It can be readily seen that most of these types of expert quotes will not be factive. Indeed in many cases the actual semantic content of a quote might be minimal; often reporters will quote a source simply saying that a finding is “the greatest thing since sliced bread” (Conrad 1999, 292). Conrad therefore emphasizes choice of source over quote content in assessing a study’s source use. The framing of sources  Ervine Goffman defined frames in his book Frame Analysis as the elemental blocks of “understanding available in our society for making sense out of events” (1974, 10). For our purposes in analyzing frames as they crop up in media, however, a slightly more specialized definition put forward by Robert Entman should suffice: “To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text.” (1993, 52). Frames are thus “contextual cues” by which media consumers understand the broader societal place of an idea in a piece of media, prioritizing some facets of the information they are presented with and deprioritizing others (Iyengar 1991, 11). Framed differently, two news articles carrying 18  identical informational content can provoke vastly different responses in readers, by, for example, placing emphasis on the lives a policy might save rather than lives it will be unable to save (Entman 1993, 54).  The sources journalists choose and the quotes they elect to print from those sources are two ways by which media frames are constructed (Tankard 2001, 100). However, sources themselves are subject to their own frames: it would be nonsensical for a reporter to include a quotation from somebody without telling the reader who that person is and why their utterance is significant. The types of sources journalists choose to incorporate into their stories vary wildly, from otherwise unexceptional citizens who happen to have witnessed something deemed newsworthy, to those highly placed in “the hierarchies of nation and society”, whose very prominence makes their utterances presumptively judged worthy of inclusion (Gans 1979, 241-242). Another category might be the “affected”, those whose lives are directly impacted by the issue being covered (Conrad 1999, 301). And, of course, there are experts. The utterances of each of these carry different weights: for example, a succinct, punchy quote like “this is the best thing since sliced bread” clearly carries different weight and implication if it is said by a someone who is described as directly affected by the policy, by an advocate for a specific political cause, by a teenager approached on the street, by the President of the United States, or by a scholar. In some of these cases we might take such an utterance very seriously, and in others disregard it entirely.  19  Like all sources, academic experts are selected broadly to maintain the credibility of journalistic claims of truth (Carlson 2009, 527-528). However, unlike members of the public or public figures, experts are generally assumed to be nonpartisan and in possession of uncommon insight into the topics they comment upon (Page et al. 1987, 39). Not all experts are scholars, of course, but scholars have particular credibility; in some cases, most notably on questions of narrow scientific knowledge, academics may be the only people qualified to speak authoritatively on a subject (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 272).  Scholarly quotes are among the most influential and authoritative a journalist can print (Page et al. 1987, 35-36; Oreskes and Conway 2010, 272), and the institution of academia relies on peer review to enforce accountability on behalf of its members. Unless an academic’s claims have passed through the process of peer review, they are nothing more than claims; they may be well-argued or convincing, they may even be correct, but they do not have the endorsement of the academic community from which they spring, and it is that community, and through it the broader institution of the academy, that provides the credibility, or proof of expertise, that distinguishes academic from non-academic knowledge (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269). The substantial persuasive weight carried by the academic frame, in other words, is within the institution of academia itself legitimated only via regular submission to the process of peer review.  As Lippmann noted, there is almost never space within media discourse for factual claims to be 20  exhaustively argued (2004, XXIII.3). And Conrad writes that the actual quotes from academics used can be subjective, speculative, or extremely informationally scant (1999, 292-293). But if the quotes themselves are problematic to evaluate, and peer review is the only real measure of an academic’s credibility within his or her field, then frames which introduce academic voices without showing readers that those voices have successfully navigated the process of peer review on the topic at hand are clearly lacking -- without that clearly demonstrated relationship, readers have no reliable way to judge which sources have earned academic credibility and which have not.  I suspected that this was problematic coming into this project because I suspected that the most common technique used to frame an academic source in a news article is by way of the source’s organizational position, which is not necessarily particularly meaningful. Certainly this proved to be the case in the specific time and issue spans I analyzed. This mismatch seems a likely culprit for many of the instances documented by Oreskes, Hoggan et al. of academic credibility being granted when it is not merited, i.e. when the subject has an organizational title or an impressive resume but no current research, or none at all ever, in the topic under discussion (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 271; Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 103).  Problems with expertise  Lest we become too gung-ho in endorsing the powers of academic expertise, backed up by peer 21  review or otherwise, we should turn briefly to some of the consequences for misuse of academic sources, and some further cases where the academic system as a whole has failed to produce useful results.  The fundamental constraint on journalists in choosing a source is accessibility; a source must be someone who is willing and able to talk to reporters. More fundamentally, a source must also be someone the reporter knows about and thinks of as an “expert” (Gans 1979, 241). Practically recognizable experts will usually be part of a legitimated social institution (Gans 1979, 246), of which academia is the prime example. Academic experts have the advantage of coming backed by a system of checks and balances: their degrees, organizational stature and most importantly their peer reviewed research all help prove their credibility to the public (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269).  But journalists do not see all organizations as equal, nor all positions within them. Harvard is generally seen as a more prestigious institution than the University of Iowa, for example, and a quote from a scholar at the former may thus be seen as more valuable than one from the latter (Conrad 1999, 291). Likewise a quote from a dean will usually be seen as more valuable than one from a lab researcher. In both these circumstances journalists have a preference for experts with prestigious titles over those without, as this fosters a sense of legitimacy for the story and is believed to be more persuasive (Conrad 1999, 291). But it is often the less prestigious bench scientists performing on the ground research that have the highest levels of technical 22  knowledge, and it is entirely possible that the world expert on any given subject will be at the University of Iowa rather than Harvard. So though sources must have useful input into a topic, in each case the journalists Conrad interviews emphasized that the prestige and persuasiveness of a source often trumps specific expertise (1999, 290-292).  Conrad writes that “balance” in science stories need not follow the same norms as in standard reporting because they are so often based around peer reviewed studies, which are presumptively valid. So though introducing cautionary notes or acknowledging controversy is not only appropriate but may, in some cases, be necessary to “round out a story”, “fringe” views need not be given equal weight with consensus views to satisfy some artificial ideal of balance (1999, 293).  But fringe views aren’t necessarily easy to distinguish. The literature is peppered with instances of expertise being misassigned: Stuart Allan documents coverage of an inventor affiliated with a local university who claimed to be able to use a “combination of a... DNA sample and GPS satellite technology” to locate a missing child. Though there was nothing but “hocus-pocus” science behind the purported invention and the inventor was not in fact an academic of any variety, failure to fact check by one news outlet led to the story behind picked up by many more (Allan 2009, 280-281).  Similarly but more seriously, Diana Davis documents how scientific and media consensus about 23  desertification in southern Morocco differed systematically from what was reported by the indigenous herdspeople who actually lived there (2003, 511-519) – here too an echo-chamber effect allowed academic claims to quote and build upon each other even though their conclusions were contradicted by the facts on the ground. This, combined with strong economic incentive for policy-makers to emphasize the severity of the problem, allowed questionable data to persist in both media and academic views of the region (Davis 2003, 520).  Equally troublingly, Maxwell Boykoff showed in a pair of studies in 2007 how coverage of climate change was very responsive to political and economic currents; in the 1990s coverage systematically highlighted “contention rather than coherence”, even though in the scientific consensus in that period was rapidly converging (2007a, 486). Meanwhile, he also showed that in the mid-2000s media coverage and scientific consensus came together only as the political environment in the United States changed around 2005 to become more receptive to scientific claims of anthropogenic climate change (2007b, 10).  Though Boykoff touches on the deliberate misinformation sewn into the debate on climate change by various aspects of the energy industry, he is more concerned with macroscopic effects than specific details. Hoggan and Littlemore lay out, from a Canadian perspective, specifically how economic entities threatened by climate change were able to sustain doubt in the public discourse long after it had been largely dispelled in the scientific community. Businesses with interest in averting meaningful action on climate change accomplished this 24  primarily by injecting expert voices into the media conversation in a variety of ways. Some were scientists who had legitimate credentials in other disciplines like Frederick Seitz, an acclaimed physicist and former president of the National Academy of Sciences who in his later career became a leading global warming sceptic, although his area of expertise was unrelated to climate science (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 41). Others, like Christopher Walter, have little if any formal academic prestige but are able to claim expertise either by outright fraudulence (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 114) or by way of positions within industry funded organizations with deceptive titles -- Walter is a spokesperson for the industry-backed “Science and Public Policy Institute” (Hoggan and Littlemore 2009, 113). Such “Experts” are able to persuade because they are able to lay claim to the mantle of academic credibility despite lacking research in any relevant disciplines.  Oreskes and Conway examine those same processes, but on a variety of issues beyond global warming. Similar campaigns of misinformation have been waged, often through the same constructed “experts”, to cast doubt on findings that cigarettes are harmful to health (which Oreskes identifies as the original such campaign), the existence of acid rain, the risks of the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative, and the dangers of pesticide use (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 6). In each case Oreskes and Conway show that successful strategies were less focused on spreading actively false information, which can be refuted, but instead on sowing confusion, relying on the theory that policy-makers, faced with an apparent lack of certainty, would choose not to act (2010, 267). In effect industry-hired academics were employed to issue deceptive, 25  non-factive analysis which resulted in media coverage that obscured matters of relative scientific certainty. The health care reform debate in the United States  There have been a great many attempts to implement legislation that would defray and control the perpetually rising costs of health care for citizens of the United States for at least a century. Health care reform has been a signature issue of, at the very least, Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Clinton and Obama. Of these the only resounding success before Obama was the Kennedy/Johnson administration, which passed Medicare in 1964. In that same century practically every other industrialized or industrializing nation in the world implemented universal health coverage of some sort, but such measures were repeatedly stymied in the United States (Jacobs and Skocpol 2010, 2-5).  It is thus unsurprising that health care reform was the most significant non-economic issue to the American public at the beginning of both recent Democratic administrations, Clinton and Obama in 1993 and 2009 respectively (Blendon and Benson 2009, 1). Effective management of a country’s health care system is generally considered vital from a policy perspective (Berman 1995, 26), and the United States’ in particular is widely judged as badly flawed in its failures to achieve universal coverage (Mechanic 2001, 35) and control costs (Inglehart 1992, 742). Coverage of health care reform in the United States differs from coverage of health care itself because though the latter is generally criticized as sensationalistic (Dan 1992, 1027), inconstant 26  (Angell and Kassirer 1994, 189), and incomplete (Moynihan et al., 2000, 1647-1648), coverage of reform tends instead towards the conservative, emphasizing risks rather than rewards (Mechanic 2001, 36).  It is also a debate with very high degrees of interest group involvement, both in the form of well-funded advertising campaigns (West et al. 1996, 63-64) and in funding for research both on the reform proposals themselves and media coverage of the reform, all of which made it into media coverage of the issue (West et al. 1996, 41). As this saturation of viewpoints increased, media coverage of the reform debate, in 1993-1994 at least, became less and less focused on specific policy issues and more on the meta-coverage of the debate itself (Jamieson and Cappella 1998, 110). 27  Findings  News articles from the sample very rarely framed academic sources in terms of their research, let alone with clear reference to their work’s peer review. Instead academics were overwhelmingly introduced using a combination of their institutional affiliations and positions, fields of study, and occasionally in terms of their specific areas of specialization. These constructions followed certain clear patterns, for which I have devised and named categories in order to discuss them at more length below.  Table 1 – Distribution of frame types  Frequency Percentage of all sources All quotes 186 100.00 Author frame 8 4.30 Authority frame1 39 20.97 Discipline frame 40 21.51 Positional frame 96 51.61 Research frame 3 1.61 Specialist frame 22 11.83 Studies quoted directly 17 9.40 1Authority frames were each also counted as another frame-type.  28  Strikingly fewer academic sources total were found in a somewhat larger pool of articles in 2009-2010 than 1993-1994. Within articles that quoted at least one academic source, those from the 1993-1994 period also quoted a slightly greater number of academics on average. Given the relatively small size of the samples I don’t feel that this difference is large enough to state conclusively that academic sources are quoted less frequently now than they were in the early 1990s, but this is a potential avenue for future research. I did not find any other strong patterns of difference between data from the two time periods.  Table 2 –Rates of academic quotation in the two sampled time periods Time period Sampled articles on health care reform Articles quoting academics Rate of academic quotation Number of academic quotations Quotes per article 1993-1994 663 70 0.1056 118 1.69 2009-2010 792 48 0.0606 68 1.42  I also found a distinct lack of diversity when it comes to who was quoted. Fully fourteen of the 120 academic sources located in the 1993-1994 sample were Dr. Uwe Reinhardt; on November 14th 1993 alone he was quoted in four different articles by four different authors. Interestingly, Reinhardt was only quoted twice in the 2009-2010 sample despite still being very active academically (indeed, his research in the last two decades has turned to American health care where previously he appears to have mostly studied the German system). Several other academics, namely Sara Rosenbaum, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Robert Blendon and Ross Baker, 29  were quoted four or more times. Academics from prestige universities also occupied a disproportionate share of the sample: 25 of the 186 total quotations were from Harvard alone, for example, and in total 68 of the 186 were from the eight Ivy League universities.  In those articles that included reference to discrete pieces of research, funding was disclosed relatively infrequently: just once in the specialist frame, three times in the author frame and five times in quotations directly from research. However, though not all academic research is externally funded, no article disclosed an absence of external funding; in many of the cases which lacked any mention of funding this can be presumed to be the case. A study of funding disclosures would need to cast its net more widely than I have in order to round up an adequate quantity for analysis.  To look at the ways that academics actually were framed and discuss the ramifications of those choices, I have identified and named the following categories of frames:  The research frame  Of the 186 sources identified, only 11 were framed with clear reference to peer reviewed studies they had done in relevant fields. Eight of those were quoted to discuss their own research in articles specifically about that research -- those I have analyzed separately under the heading “The Author Frame” below.  30  Of the remaining three, two were in the same article, Reed Abelson’s “When Legislation Goes Into Overtime”, printed on December 27th 2009, which drew historical parallels to a quickly repealed Reagan-era attempt to prevent the medical bills of the seriously ill from spiralling out of control, the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. Jon Gabel and Thomas Rice were introduced in the article as follows:  \\'\\'What is similar is a lack of understanding,\\'\\' said Jon Gabel, a health researcher who  helped write a post-mortem of the repealed bill for the journal Health Affairs in 1990.   The support of groups like AARP is also a critical difference, said Thomas Rice, a health  policy expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is also one of the authors  of the 1990 Health Affairs piece.  Uncommonly, Abelson’s framing of Gabel does not make his institutional affiliation clear; though he is a senior research fellow at the University of Chicago the bulk of his work appears to have been done by way of the non-profit sector, so perhaps this is a deliberate omission. This highlights the power of the author frame, though, and indeed the broader points about peer review upon which this project is based: despite knowing almost nothing else about him, a reader encountering the passage above would have clear justification to give credence to his opinion. On that same note, though Rice’s framing contains additional information about his academic career, it does not seem like Abelson intends him to have more credibility than Gabel. 31  Regardless, both introductions are succinct; providing sufficient information to back up Gabel and Rice’s expertise does not disrupt the flow of the 1039-word article.  As an aside, though only four other sources quoted by Abelson were found in the total sample (two of them in this same article) all were somewhat more informatively framed than the norm.  The other academic framed in terms of her peer reviewed research is a somewhat marginal case, as it appears possible that it was incidental, and refers only to research that would undergo peer review in the immediate future, rather than a finished study. In Adam Clymer, Robert Pear and Robin Toner’s August 29th 1994 article “What Went Wrong? How the Health Care Campaign Collapsed”, we find this passage:  And newspapers and television failed to cut through the din and educate people, said  Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania.  Instead, they merely elevated public skepticism.  \"Everything the press did appeared to engender cynicism,\" she said, citing a study that  she and a colleague, Joseph N. Cappella, plan to present next Saturday to an American  Political Science Association convention in New York.  32  Jamieson’s introduction in the article, then, begins as an absolutely typical example of the authority and professional frames (described in more detail below). While the authors’ work- process can only be guessed at, it seems possible that Jamieson herself made spontaneous reference to a paper that was going to undergo peer review -- its inclusion thus appears more likely to be an accident than a deliberate effort on behalf of the authors to establish Jamieson’s academic credibility. Coincidentally, the study mentioned is almost certainly the same one by Jamieson and Cappella that is referenced in this paper’s literature review, “The Role of the Press in the Health Care Reform Debate of 1993-1994”.  Within a sample of 186 sources, three examples over two articles, and one of them marginal, can only be considered outliers. In sum, academics were effectively never framed with reference to their peer reviewed work in 1993 and 2009 when called to comment in anything save articles actually about their own research.  The discipline and professional frames   The two most common methods of framing academic sources in the sample were also the most informationally scant. As they are very similar in their ramifications, I will deal with them together.  In the first, which I’ll call the discipline frame, sources were introduced by a combination of 33  their institutional affiliations and disciplines of study. Of the 186 academic sources I examined, 40 were framed this way.  Here is an example, from Gina Kolata’s August 12th 2009 article “Insurers\\' Survey Points to Big Bills as Health Care Problem”:  The situation is so irrational, said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, that it simply cannot go on. “We will not emerge out of this decade with this lunacy,” Dr. Reinhardt said, adding, “You worry about credit card charges, you scream for consumer protection -- why not scream for it here?”  As is quite typical for this sort of article, the above is the entirety of Reinhardt’s participation in the article -- here he is agreeing with the basic conclusion of an insurance industry survey that pointed to inordinately high doctor’s fees as a key contributor to the country’s health care cost crisis. But especially with such an inflammatory quote, and one which is effectively impossible to fact-check, who he is is very important despite the brevity of his contribution. A “health economist from Princeton” seems, at first blush, someone who should have great deal of credibility on this topic. On closer examination, though, it doesn’t necessarily mean much; a reader doesn’t know if Reinhardt is a post-doc, a researcher, a professor, or indeed a hobbyist affiliated with the university in some other capacity (Allan 2009, 281). Nor does the reader have any way to know if he has done any research relevant to the topic, nor, if he has, if it was done 34  in the last 30 years. A “health economist” might be someone who studies outcomes and efficiency, or how demand works in the health care system, or any number of esoteric topics that might have little or no bearing on whether the fees doctors charge in the United States are rational. The discipline frame offers little by which a reader can judge the credibility of a source save a vague sense that they study something in the field, and of the credibility of their academic institution.  Very similarly, the professional frame introduces an academic source by their field of study and specific institutional positions (but excluding positions of authority, which I have chosen to discuss separately below under “Authority frames”). At 96 sources within the 186 collected, this was the most common type of frame used to present academics. The most common position by a considerable margin (50 total) was, unsurprisingly, “professor”; most of the rest were similarly generic titles like “lecturer”, “teacher”, “researcher” and “physician”.  A scattered few were introduced using more specific titles like “associate professor”, “senior fellow” or “professor emeritus”. Many of these titles carry quite a lot of information for those who understand their ramifications – for example, “associate professor” is a tenured position, which usually means that its holder has published a certain amount of peer reviewed research. However, though these carry more value for the reader, their use is limited by their impenetrability to those outside the academy (they are in effect jargon terms) and by the different standards academic institutions use to determine qualifications. A reader conversant 35  with the university faculty career path will find them informative, but there’s little reason to believe that they will carry much weight with the public at large.  Here is an example of this type of frame from Peter Kerr’s September 13th 1993 article “Doctors and Insurers Say Program Would Tread Too Heavily on Their Turfs; Cap on Premiums Is Seen as Stifling Real Competition”:  “What might happen if you have too tight a cap on insurance company premiums is that their profit margins get wiped out,” said Uwe D. Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University and a medical economist.  This is materially almost identical to the discipline frame example above, with the single additional piece of information about Reinhardt: that he is a professor at Princeton. This clears up a single question a reader might ask about Reinhardt’s credentials, he is some variety of professor rather than a less prestigiously positioned academic (however, to refer back to Peter Conrad as quoted in the literature review above, in reality institutional prestige does not necessarily reflect actual expertise; 1999, 291). Professors and other instructors might also be presumed to carry a broader base of knowledge than academics who do not teach, such as administrators or researchers. But the positional frame doesn’t help at all to prove his specific expertise.  36  As it turns out, Reinhardt, Princeton’s James Madison Professor of Political Economy, has done a significant amount of research in the areas he is commenting on here. He published an article in Health Affairs in 2006 titled “The Pricing of U.S. Hospital Services: Chaos Behind A Veil Of Secrecy” which, at somewhat greater length, expounds much the same point of view that he expresses in the first example above, backed by substantive research -- notably, in that article Reinhardt explicitly thanks his anonymous peer reviewers for their “constructive criticism on an earlier draft” (2006, 68). And he wrote an article for the American Journal of Law and Medicine’s first issue in 1993 examining, among other things, various schema for the pricing of health insurance titled “Reforming the Health Care System: The Universal Dilemma Implementing U.S. Health Care Reform”.  So in both these cases the source quoted appears to be one whom the academy would readily recognize as qualified to discuss the topics he is commenting on, but a conscientious reader might be forgiven for entirely disregarding Reinhardt’s opinions for lack of information as to who he is. Casual readers, of course, will presumably see “Princeton” and pay attention to what he has to say, but that in this case their confidence would be well-placed does not change that they could have as easily been wrong to do so.  An example of where such a reader’s faith may have been misplaced can be found in the article “Christian Leaders Unite on Political Issues” written by Laura Goldstein and published November 20th 2009. Therein, a Princeton “professor of jurisprudence”, later reintroduced as a 37  “legal scholar”, named Robert P. George is quoted regarding health care reform that “the dangers to religious liberties are very real.” This quotation is set against one from Ira Lupu, a “law professor at George Washington University”, who characterizes suggestions that religious institutions might somehow be forced to accept abortion or embryo-destructive research as “fear-mongering”.  In this case, Lupu has written several peer reviewed articles in the last decade on the ability of the American government to impose behaviour on religious institutions. But George doesn’t appear to have any current scholarship, and those articles of his I was able to locate address questions of natural law and Catholic morality; the case for his expertise on the question of how health care reform might impede religious liberty in the United States seems much weaker. Within the limited frame presented in the Goldstein article, however, a reader has no tools to make such a distinction. Indeed within the article the two are explicitly equal in stature as professors of law.  As someone with no personal knowledge of either of these scholars, or indeed any deep knowledge of law scholarship, it is very difficult for me to declare that Lupu is more credible on this topic than Robert. Moreover, it is of course entirely unrealistic to expect that any reader will do even the small amount of background investigation into the two that I have done. But this is precisely the bind that an article’s author, who has direct access to the sources and an existing obligation to verify their expertise, could have resolved for readers simply by explaining 38  what research these sources have done that leaves them qualified to comment. The authority frame  In the authority frame reporters introduce an academic by way of a position of authority or prestige, most often director of a centre or institute. While in many ways this carries much the same ramifications as an ordinary professional frame, constructions of this type carry a few interesting characteristics that merit separate attention.  There were a total of 38 examples of authority framed academics in the sample, including the above mentioned 29 professional frames, plus three in specialist frames and six in author frames (see below).  As a side note, despite Conrad’s assertion that all else being equal journalists prefer to quote scientists with prestigious titles over those without (1999, 291), this means that academics who did not hold prestigious titles were quoted approximately five times as frequently as those who did. Moreover, recall that this is in the New York Times, a newspaper whose reporters surely do not have difficulty gaining access to those in positions of authority (especially remembering that usually one of the duties of a director of an academic institution is to be available to the media). I  would not have been surprised to find a far greater proportion of managers and executives in the sample; that there were as few as there are implies to me that the Times reporters were considering more than just a source’s prestige when choosing whom to quote. 39   For an example of the authority frame, and how choosing an academic with a prestigious title can actual confuse issues of credibility, see this passage from David Herszenhorn’s October 12th 2009 article “Soaring Costs Remain a Bugaboo in Expert’s Eyes”:  Can all that money really be saved without rationing care or lowering the quality of  treatment?  “In three letters: yes,” said Elliot G. Fisher, director of the Center for Health Policy  Research at Dartmouth College, which produces an atlas showing how Medicare  spending varies widely across the country with no evidence that higher expenditures  achieve better outcomes for patients.  Fisher is then quoted at length through the article. This formulation raises three distinct issues:  First, though Fisher is director of a college centre for health policy research, his area of research and the currency of his expertise is not clear. This is basically similar to problems raised above with the professional and discipline frames, but problems of currency in particular are exacerbated in the case of a source in a managerial or executive role: though in many cases the opposite will certainly be true, these roles conceivably risk pulling even the most diligent scholars away from their own research. In Fisher’s particular case this may not be the case: he is 40  listed as the co-author of quite a few articles in the last decade on quality of care, for example “The Implications of Regional Variations in Medicare Spending”, a two-part article printed in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2003. None of this is clear from the article, however, and a reader could be forgiven for guessing that someone in Fisher’s position might not have much time to pursue his or her own research.  Second, Fisher’s connection to the atlas mentioned, a significant research endeavour even if it isn’t subject to peer review, is opaque: the reader, knowing nothing about the size or composition of the Dartmouth centre, has no real way of gauging his personal level of involvement in the research which produces it. Even had Fisher’s precise position within the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, “co-principal investigator”, been disclosed it would not be clear what his day-to-day role in its work is, sitting as he does atop a staff of about 20 other scholars plus assorted analysts. Barring a digression into the inner workings of the atlas, this is not an easily solvable problem; unlike “professor”, which carries a strong implication of both research and instruction, none of Fisher’s many titles necessarily imply that he is active in the production of knowledge.  Third is the issue that, unlike academics generally, executives in academic organizations are expected to be advocates, and thus advance agendas. Regardless of whether this is true on a case by case basis, this makes them very different from “ordinary” academics, who are quoted because they are seen as neutral (Page et al. 1987, 39) and are probably no more or less 41  agenda-driven than any other randomly selected individual. In his first quote alone Fisher is making a very bold assertion. The paragraph that follows implies that he has access to research to back it up, but because he is also clearly identified as the director of a health policy research centre I would expect a sceptical reader to take his assertion with a grain of salt -- what is he trying to gain for his centre by saying what he is saying?  This is not to imply that Herszenhorn should have concealed Fisher’s position from his readers, of course, nor that academics who attain managerial or executive positions shouldn’t be quoted when appropriate. But these three issues do suggest that such positions can actually be disadvantageous when attempting to establish an academic source’s expertise and neutrality, contrary to the perception (Conrad 1999, 291) that they are more desirable. This in turn emphasizes that when academics who have attained prestigious positions are quoted, effective and informational frames are even more important than for ordinary academic sources. The specialist frame  In somewhat fewer instances, 21 total in the sample, academics were introduced by way of their specific topics of study. This I have called the specialist frame, since it emphasizes not just the source’s discipline (though it includes it), but also their area of specialization. For example, see this passage from David Rosenbaum’s July 24th 1994 article on Newt Gingrich, “A Republican Who Sees Himself as a Revolutionary on the Verge of Victory”:  42  This could hurt Mr. Gingrich\\'s effort to win control of the House for Republicans, said  James Thurber, a political scientist at American University who studies Congress and the  Presidency. “The middle has shifted for the Republican Party in the House,” Mr. Thurber  said. “The data don\\'t show that the middle has shifted in the country.”  Though it is still not clear from this frame if Thurber has relevant and current peer reviewed research into the topic of discussion, it is at least much clearer than if he had simply been identified as a “political scientist” that he is in the right ballpark. A reader knows that Thurber studies Congress, rather than some unrelated topic of political science like international aid to the developing world or the emergence of the feminist movement.  This an improvement over the discipline frame, though readers still don’t really know precisely what it is that Thurber studies. As it happens, Thurber’s research on Congress in the decade or so before this article was printed was mostly concerned with congressional/presidential relationships, which seems at least broadly appropriate; again, though, Rosenbaum would have been the best positioned, when writing the article, to make that even clearer.  Here is another effective example of the specialist frame, from Monica Davey’s September 29th 2009 article “Health Care Overhaul and Mandatory Coverage Stir States\\' Rights Claims”:  Mark A. Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University who has studied the 43  constitutionality of mandates that people buy health insurance, said, \\'\\'There is no way this challenge will succeed in court,\\'\\' adding that the state measures seemed more “sort of an act of defiance, a form of civil disobedience if you will.”  On the one hand, a reader of the above passage has substantial assurance that Hall has applicable research to the topic at hand, in this case laws passed in some states pre-emptively attempting to outlaw, a significant part of the health care reform legislation that was then pending in Congress (Manchikanti et al. 2011, 35). But on the other, it also highlights the absurdity of not telling the reader, in so many words, precisely what that research is -- Mark Hall’s “The Constitutionality of Mandates to Purchase Health Insurance” was published in the Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics about a month before this article was written; the article could have explicitly stated this while barely changing a word.  Indeed, it seems quite clear that the authors of the news articles chose not to relay what they knew about the source’s research -- indeed, it seems very likely that Bailey contacted Hall because of the article he had just published. When the title of the article is paraphrased almost verbatim, why not make that connection transparent? The author frame  As mentioned above, I found a small number of academic quotes in the sample from articles that were pegged on a piece of research or a study. There were eight instances of this, all but 44  one of which contained clear reference to the peer review status of the article.  Here is an example, from a July 21st 1994 article without a by-line entitled “Study Predicts Large Surplus of Physicians”:  The United States will have a surplus of 165,000 doctors by the year 2000, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported today in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  More than 90 percent of the surplus doctors will be specialists and 40 percent of all  medical specialists could be unnecessary by the year 2000, the author said, adding that  that underscored the need for medical schools to push students into family and  community medicine.  \"Many medical students, given the choice of high-paying specialties with salaries two to  three times that of primary care, make the obvious choice,\" said Jonathan Weiner,  associate professor of health policy and management.  While this example bears many of the characteristics of the sort of peer review framing I was looking for, it is manifestly different for one simple reason: in the constructions I was examining primarily, academic sources are quoted because they provide expertise but are not 45  stakeholders in the stories they are commenting on. Conversely, in articles that are actually about discrete works of research (which in my cataloguing of the data I have been referring to as “study articles”), authors are not outside commentators but instead key actors in the story.  All that said, however, the small number of examples collected here of study articles suggest that this format of news article is far more likely in its existing conventions of reporting to provide readers with sufficient information to evaluate their academic credibility. This is a clear avenue of future research. Quotations directly from research  Additionally, academic studies were quoted 17 times in the sample without any direct commentary from their authors. As with study articles I recorded these but considered them to be a substantively different phenomenon from academic commentary. That said, I was surprised to find that, like academic quotations and unlike study articles, direct quotation of academic research contained reference to its peer review status relatively infrequently: in only three of these instances was the peer review status of the studies quoted clear. I say surprising because I had supposed that a study’s place of publication would be considered essential information when quoting from it.  Certainly it did not seem onerous or intrusive to include in the articles that did so. For instance this, from Craig Whitney’s November 14th 1993 article “How Others Do It: Germany; Coverage 46  For All, With Choices”:  Also, according to a study by John K. Iglehart in The New England Journal of Medicine,  \"German hospitals have fewer pieces of high-technology equipment than most big  urban  hospitals in the United States.\"  For a counterexample, a study quotation without reference to its peer review status, see this article by David Rosenbaum from October 26th 1993, called “Economic Outlaw: American Healthcare”:  To illustrate that point, researchers at Dartmouth Medical School tried to determine how patients would respond if they were thoroughly informed about various possible treatments. The researchers found, for example, that when they used videotapes and other techniques to explain carefully the advantages and disadvantages of prostate surgery, the number of patients at the Veterans Administration hospital in White River Junction, Vt., who decided against having such surgery increased significantly.  It is clear in this example that it would not have been difficult for Rosenbaum to have included a simple phrase telling readers what the study was called and where it was published, but he chose not to. As it stands, there is not even enough information for an interested reader to look up the article independently; after some sleuthing I believe that the study being referred to 47  was “Developing shared decision-making programs to improve the quality of health care” by Kasper, Mulley, and Wennberg, published in 1992 in Quality Review Bulletin 18:6. But I’m only somewhat confident in this guess -- certainly it can be said, though, that knowing next to nothing about the study based on only the article itself, it is hard to give its much credibility to what it reports it as saying.  However, in this example and indeed all the other studies quoted directly there was at least a short description of either how the study worked or what it found; at the very least this can be said to be at base more informative than the professional and discipline frames. 48  Conclusions and recommendations  When a journalist quotes someone, it is essential that it be clear for the reader who the source is and why their opinion matters -- academic expertise is only one of a myriad of reasons a journalist might choose to quote an individual in a news story, but it is a potent one, carrying substantial authority (Page et al. 1987, 39).  But unlike that of many types of expertise, academic credibility is derived from a fairly cohesive institution, and within that institution there is a system by which to determine who is qualified to speak on which topics: peer review.  Peer review is the preferred method of internal validation in the academy for good reason; it is also a very good way for readers and journalists to reassure themselves about an academic source’s expertise; it is not infallible (Henderson 2010, 738), but it seems likely that it is the best mechanism easily available for such a function (Oreskes and Conway 2010, 269).  In a perfect world, how credible a source is wouldn’t matter because everything they are quoted as saying would be independently verifiable. In reality, the things academic sources are actually quoted saying are often non-factive or otherwise difficult to evaluate (Conrad 1999, 292). In these cases sources’ personal credibility is the only metric by which a reader can decide how much stock to place in their utterances. Thus, how sources are presented to readers is 49  incredibly important; scant information could lead readers to doubt trustworthy sources, or conversely trust the expertise of a source who might not merit it.  However, it is clear from the data that in coverage by America’s preeminent paper of one of the highest-stakes political discussions in the country, the health care debate, academics were simply not framed clearly or transparently. Most were portrayed by way of their institutional positions and/or their broad disciplines of study, methods dramatically inadequate to express how and why an academic has applicable expertise on a topic.  This broad failure to adequately back up claims of academic expertise leaves readers vulnerable to active attempts to spread misinformation, as documented in coverage of climate change and tobacco health by Conway and Oreskes (2010) and Hoggan and Littlemore (2009). On a topic as politically heavy as health care reform, it is by no means difficult to imagine that similar attempts to misinform were made.  Even without deceptive behaviour, opaque framing also risks simple mismanagement of academic sources. Academics are highly educated and will thus often be broadly knowledgeable in a variety of fields, and as human beings many will have opinions on subjects that they in fact know nothing about at all. But actual academic expertise is an inch wide and a mile deep, subject at least in theory to constant checks and updates. A journalism which fails to recognize this will fail to take advantage of the real advantages that academic knowledge can 50  provide, while misassigning academic prestige where it is not warranted.  The public discourse suffers when the information presented by the news media is unreliable – a journalism that aims to inform the public would therein be failing if its sources, vital to the construction of journalistic knowledge, could not be trusted.  There appears to be a journalistic format already in existence which is more inclined to portraying academic knowledge transparently and credibly: the study article. Perhaps as a simple accident of the work process that generates them, or perhaps due to different beliefs about their intended audiences, articles of this genre seem much more inclined to take the time to explain study’s content and pedigree. Though the study article format is not universally applicable – if nothing else it is of no use to a journalist who wants to report on a topic that hasn’t already been through academic inquiry – it is nevertheless noteworthy that there is a genre of news that appears, at least from this small sample, to already manage academic sources quite adeptly.  But even in conventional news articles, it would not take a revolution in reporting technique to close this gap. In many cases, perhaps even most, it seems likely that the reporters were personally aware of their source’s peer reviewed research, but simply chose not to pass that information on to their readers. If a reporter walks into an interview without already knowing 51  anything his or her source’s academic background, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to simply ask to be directed to some of the source’s research in the field, or indeed to look it up back at the office. Information about a source’s scholarship is not difficult to obtain, and it would require minimal changes in a journalist’s professional routines to start incorporating it into the frames used to present academic sources to the public. But such a change would greatly improve the transparency and thus, I believe, enhance the credibility of the articles produced.  52  References  Allan, Stuart. 2009. The Future of Science Journalism.

Joe instructed me on how to put together a solid content analysis of the news media.  I also want to thank my secondary reader Ben Parfitt.  Ben’s expertise in my research area made the process of understanding and analysing forest policy in British Columbia much easier. The School of Journalism has provided endless support over the past two years.  Barbara Wallin was particularly encouraging and it was always reassuring to know she was there.  My colleagues at the school have been wonderful, providing professional support and friendship along this journey.  I’d also like to acknowledge the various funding bodies that enabled me to pursue graduate studies -- the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the School of Journalism and the University of British Columbia. i i     vii      1   In 2008, the British Columbia government released the BC Bionergy Strategy.  This strategy committed the government to putting $25 million towards establishing a provincial Bioenergy Network that would invest in new bioenergy projects and technologies.  It also mandated a BC Hydro two-part call for bioenergy power, and called for the development of ten community energy projects to be fired by biomass by 2020.  This strategy was developed as an offshoot of the BC Energy Plan which was developed by the Liberal government in 2007, and which sets strong environmental targets in an effort to fight the effects of climate change.  The province’s goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 33% below 2007 levels by the year 2020.  It also planned to ensure that all new electricity generation projects would produce no greenhouse gas emissions, that the province would become energy self-sufficient by 2016, and that it would continue to produce 90% of its electricity through clean and renewable methods.  The plan called for the development of the BC Bioenergy Strategy to: “take advantage of B.C.’s abundant sources of renewable energy, such as beetle-killed timber, wood wastes and agricultural residues,” (BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources BC energy plan outlines vision 2).  Using wood fiber to produce energy was not a new concept for the province.  For years, many of the province’s pulp mills had burned mill residues, or waste, to power their facilities (BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources The BC energy plan 2).  What changed was the idea that this technology could be used to provide power for other energy consumers.  A facility could generate power, and BC Hydro would sell that power to customers around the province. i      2   Wood bioenergy combines two resource based industries in the province: the forest industry and the energy industry.  Together, the two industries contribute about 12% to the province’s gross domestic product (Hoberg 332).  The nature of the industries and their role within the province has been changing in recent years.  The forest industry has experienced a sharp decline in revenues because of the economic downturn in the United States and a precipitous drop in housing starts and lumber demand.  In addition, the forest industry has dealt with the outbreak of the mountain pine beetle epidemic (Hoberg 339).  Since the 1980s, the energy industry has been moving towards privatization and deregulation, and premier Gordon Campbell and his Liberal government have been even more aggressive with this trend (Hoberg 347).  Since 2002, the construction and operation of new energy projects has been handled by independent power producers and without BC Hydro, the provincial crown corporation (331). British Columbia’s forest industry contributes about 7% to the province’s gross domestic product each year (Hoberg 332) making it a major contributor to provincial revenues.  The industry has experienced turmoil for years, but in 2007, the economic downturn began to be felt in the forest industry, and it suffered badly (Hoberg 340).  British Columbia’s forest industry is largely dependent on the U.S. market - wood products are exported to the United States and used in residential construction.  In 2007, the American housing market collapsed, and the demand for wood products plummeted.  At the time, the Canadian dollar had risen compared to the U.S. dollar, making Canadian lumber products even less attractive to potential buyers.   In addition to other market factors, the price of lumber dropped, meaning little revenue was made from the lumber that did sell (Hoberg 341).  In 2006, Canada capitulated to the United States and established the Softwood Lumber i i     3  Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America.  This agreement included a condition where taxes to export wood products to the United States would increase as the amount of wood exported decreased (Parfitt Softwood 6). The agreement also removed the policy of appurtenancy -- where companies that were given the right to cut down publicly owned trees in British Columbia had to support local sawmills by processing the wood in that region (Parfitt Softwood 3).  Further change to the industry came with the introduction of a market-based pricing system for wood -- a Liberal campaign promise and an essential step toward establishing the agreement (Parfitt Softwood 9). This new trade agreement with the United States compounded the impact of the market collapse for the forest industry.  Between 2007 and 2008, 20,000 forestry workers lost their jobs -- sawmill workers were affected particularly badly (Hoberg 332).  The decline in the forest industry has had major implications for forest practices.  The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives published a report examining the amount of usable wood being cut down and wasted at logging sites across British Columbia.  It was reported that 17.5 million cubic metres of usable wood was left behind between 2004 and 2008 (Parfitt Shortchanged 1).  The carbon content in this wood stream is equivalent to about 3.23 million tonnes, which if totally released to the atmosphere would add another 5% to British Columbia’s total carbon emissions (Parfitt Shortchanged 1).  In conjunction with the economic crisis, British Columbia is experiencing an environmental crisis.  The mountain pine beetle is expected to kill 80% of the province’s merchantable pine by 2013 (BC Ministry of Forest and Range 2).  As of fall 2009, roughly 620 million cubic meters of timbre, about 45% of the pine, had been killed (Hamilton).  Once killed this pine has a shelf-life, or a period of time the wood is still commercially valuable.  The minimum shelf-life predicted for beetle-killed wood is five years, the maximum is twenty years, v      4  but generally the trees are thought to be commercially valuable for up to twelve years (BC Ministry of Forest and Range 11).  The forest industry in British Columbia is at a critical point (Forest Products Association of Canada 1).  After a sharp decline in the industry as a result of the economic downturn, stakeholders are struggling to find new uses for the forests. At the same time, the climate change crisis is pushing citizens and governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Historically, the province has taken resources out of the forests to sell as wood products.  Now there is a movement to find ways to use the economic value of the carbon stored in trees and reduce the environmental impact of forestry practices.  The provincial government has endorsed the idea of using wood to produce a clean energy: bioenergy.  The targets set by the provincial government maintains that its energy plan can be partially fulfilled using bioenergy technologies.  This study explores the technology that burns wood to produce electricity and heat; other forms of bioenergy such as wind, solar, tidal, etc. are not dealt with in this report.  Wood bioenergy is an interesting subject because it has the potential to provide growth for the forest industry -- an industry that is currently in decline.  Since the BC Energy Plan was announced in 2007, BC Hydro has awarded four wood bioenergy contracts to generate 500 gigawatt hours of energy in 2008 - roughly the energy consumed by 50,000 households annually.  In 2010, the provincial crown corporation wants to secure contracts that will supply an additional 1,000 gigawatt hours of electricity (Parfitt Managing 18).     5   Different groups involved in the forest industry foresee a growing bioenergy industry affecting them in different ways.  The pulp and paper industry is concerned about the use of mill residues, meaning the waste created from processing wood --sawdust, chips and shavings -- for bioenergy.   The pulp and paper industry has been using these materials to make a product for decades.  It is worried that increasing the number of bioenergy facilities will drive up the price of these materials, making the pulp and paper industry no longer economically viable (Parfitt Managing 18).  The use of logging residues, the waste created from harvesting trees, and pine beetle- killed trees for bioenergy is part of the BC Bioenergy Strategy (6).  Some researchers and environmentalists worry about the ecological impact of removing this material from the forests in addition to the normal wood harvest.  This group insists this wood is needed to help forests re- grow after being harvested (Chapman).  There also are concerns about the cost of salvaging bioenergy wood from mountain pine beetle-killed trees and the waste logs that Parfitt researched (Shortchanged).  The cost of taking this wood out of the forest and transporting it to a facility may only be economically viable if the facility is a short distance from the wood source.  The price consumers pay for electricity is so low that power producers want a guarantee that it would still be economically beneficial (Clarke).  This technology also becomes less environmentally friendly, the further the wood is transported because of the greenhouse gases produced in transportation (Parfitt Managing 23).  If a company pursues a bioenergy project there is the need to have a constant supply of fuel or wood.  The industry is looking for a guarantee that it will continue to have access to the province’s publicly owned trees in the long term -- after the pine beetle-killed wood has been used and logging residues are not as readily available.  This is a concern from an i      6  environmentalist perspective; environmentalists want to preserve the forests, meanwhile companies that traditionally harvest the forest also need access to these trees (Parfitt Managing 24).  British Columbia has an abundance of trees, making wood bioenergy a seemingly obvious choice for “green” energy production in the province. Furthermore, forests re-grow making bioenergy a renewable form of energy.  But, once planted, trees must stay standing long enough to provide enough ecological benefits to be considered a renewable resource.  These benefits include carbon storage which generally increases as trees get older (Parfitt Managing 29).  Wood bioenergy is often said to be carbon neutral.  The reason for this being that the carbon released by burning wood is absorbed by living trees.  Parfitt has found that this is not necessarily true.  When trees are cut down and turned into wood products, they continue to store carbon.  But when trees are burned to produce energy, that carbon is immediately released into the atmosphere.  Furthermore, if the wood residues are left in the forest after harvesting, carbon is released as the wood decomposes but it is released slowly over time and some of the carbon remains tied up in nature without being released (Managaing 22).  The Vancouver Sun, the largest circulating province-wide daily newspaper in British Columbia, has both energy and forest beat reporters, indicating the importance of these two industries to the province.  How this newspaper presents wood bioenergy is important because of the government’s movement toward investing money and resources in to developing bioenegy projects. i i     7   This study shows that The Vancouver Sun has been following the growth of the bioenergy industry in British Columbia.  The public relies on the news media to learn about issues and events (Lippman 22), thus it is important to study how ideas are presented.  This paper explores how The Vancouver Sun has presented wood bioenergy to the public and how this has changed over time.  This paper goes on to suggest how this can affect the public’s understanding of a subject and the public’s beliefs and feelings toward it. Nuclear energy  Nuclear energy provides an example of where the news media focused on certain aspects of a new technology, only to drastically change how it was represented twenty years later (Palfreman, 2006).  In the 1950s, nuclear energy became a source of electricity and two vastly different view points existed about the industry.  As an energy source, nuclear energy can provide a plentiful supply of energy, but nuclear physics can also be used to make weapons. Palfreman (25) says both of these viewpoints were well known in the 1950s but most of the media coverage about nuclear energy was positive or neutral.  In 1966, there was a meltdown at a nuclear reactor near Detroit.  It was a serious accident, but one the press didn’t explore.  During the 1973 oil crisis, many stories focused on the energy generating potential of nuclear physics (Palfreman 25).  By the mid 1970s, nuclear energy was being presented differently - the negative aspects were presented in the news coverage.  The news media started presenting the views of physicists opposed to nuclear energy and protesters as well as the dangers of nuclear physics - explosions and radiation (Palfreman 26).  Nuclear energy illustrates how a story can be framed and how those frames may i i i    8  transform over time.  As the technology was emerging, nuclear energy was framed as a solution to an energy crisis.  Within a couple of decades the frames changed, and the news was dominated by the dangers of nuclear physics.  Certain actors gained support and became more vocal. Images of the destruction caused by nuclear weapons became prominent and there were accidents at nuclear power plants to act as focusing events.  This frame transformation is not unique to nuclear energy.  Using corn to produce ethanol and making a biofuel or bioediesel was a popular idea, a supposedly green technology.  Recently, the media coverage of the use of corn to produce fuel has changed to discuss the issues of an emerging food crisis and using agricultural land to produce a fuel.  There are multiple actors who have a stake in the growing bioenergy industry in British Columbia and each has a different perspective on the issue.  This content analysis should provide insight into whose perspective is being used as a frame for the news on bioenergy and if this frame has changed throughout the Liberal government’s leadership.  Wood bioenergy is being framed in two ways. One - wood bioenergy is the solution to the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Two - wood bioenergy is a green energy that is carbon neutral. To examine this hypothesis, this study asked the following questions  Were the following terms used: “carbon neutral” or a derivate such as “greenhouse gas neutral” “green energy” “renewable” “mountain pine beetle” or “pine beetle” or “mountain pine beetle-killed timber”   Does the article discuss how bioenergy works?  Does the article discuss wood bioenergy in the future?  Does the article address reforestation/rehabilitation?  Does the article address carbon balance?  x      9   One of the longstanding ideas about the role of the news media is that it defends the principles of democracy.  Walter Lippmann wrote that journalists were responsible for conveying news and information to the public.  Journalists act as the link between the policymakers and the public.  The news is a particularly important source of political information for the public (Iyengar Responsible 8).   The pubic turns to the news for information, and Lippmann believed that news forms public opinion (22).  Lippmann was quick to explain that this doesn’t mean the public is getting pure information.  The journalist does not witness the news; reporters depend on sources to act as witnesses.  News is second hand and is not an exact account; it is a representation of the story. This means that public opinion isn’t formed by events but by how those events are told. Lippmann draws on Plato’s philosophies and explains that the news media puts pictures in our heads and those pictures give us impressions of our external world.  The public responds to those impressions, or pseudo-environments, not the real environment.  This means news acts by instructing public opinion (Lippmann 12).   One of the ideals of journalism is that news should be presented in an objective way.  The method used to produce journalism should be transparent and the journalist should try to get the best information available (Kovach and Rosentiel 81-110).  News that is truthful and objective helps establish trust between the media and the public, the people the news media try to serve (Kovach and Rosentiel 52-3).  Despite news media’s efforts to be objective, it still has the power     10  to influence its audience.  There are three well established news media effects: agenda setting, priming and framing.  Maxwell McCombs, a prominent agenda-setting theorist, has also written about how agenda setting and framing can work together. Other effects have been discussed throughout the literature including the news media as informers, persuaders and the so called \"bandwagon effect\" that refers to political campaigns.  This study focused on the idea of framing and details about the other effects are not included in this report. A brief description of agenda- setting and priming is included below to help demonstrate how the framing effect is different.  McCombs first found evidence of the agenda-setting effect in the 1968 presidential election (McCombs and Shaw 177).  He found an almost perfect correlation in rank order between the issues that voters felt were most important during the election and the amount of news coverage those issues received. Agenda setting suggests that news media tell the audience what issues are important by focusing on those issues in their coverage.  Essentially, the volume of coverage is what matters - news coverage affects the salience of an issue on the agenda (McCombs and Shaw 186).  With extensive news coverage of an issue, the audience believes it has more importance nationally (Iyengar Responsible 133).  Priming, like agenda setting, has to do with the extent of news coverage.  The difference is that it specifically influences an audience’s political judgments.  Iyengar explains that news coverage affects the criteria used to evaluate political leaders (Responsible 133).  The best way to understand priming is with an example.  In the 1992 presidential election, the media focused on the economy in their coverage, and president George Bush lost the election to Bill Clinton. When asked, most voters said the state of the economy was the reason that they voted against Bush (Miller and Krosnick 265).  The authours suggest that if the media had focused on the triumph of the Gulf War, the outcome of the election may have been different. i      11    Framing as an effect of news media will be discussed to a greater extent because of its importance to this study.  Framing is discussed throughout social science literature and can be found in psychology, sociology, public opinion and political research.  Framing relates to the idea of how an issue is presented, which aspects of the issue are highlighted and in what context.  Todd Gitlin wrote about framing in the context of how the media portrayed Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) - the group that organized the first national demonstration against the Vietnam war in 1965 and that Gitlin was once president of.  Gitlin says framing is a way of seeing an event: “Journalism’s more regular approach is to process social opposition, to control its image and to diffuse it at the same time, to absorb what can be absorbed into the dominant structure of definitions and images and to push the rest to the margins of social life” (5).  Iyengar (Overview 214) explains framing as “a more subtle form of media influence, associated not with the amount of news but the manner of presentation.”  To Gitlin, frames are about selection and this selection works in various places.  He says frames help journalists do their job in reporting the news, and help news consumers understand the news (Gitlin 98). This means a journalist will take an issue and package it a certain way.  In the news media, journalists construct a frame based on ideology, attitudes and professional norms (Scheufele 109).  Gitlin (100) says this often happens because of the time constraints put on journalists and because of pack-journalism where journalists from different organizations follow the same angle of a story.  Scheufele (115) says the medium where the news is published also influences the frame through its political orientation and organizational routines.   Scheufele (115) argues that external sources of information, especially stakeholders and actors, are the third influence on the frame -- this is described in more detail below.  It has also been reported that a frame is what makes an issue interesting; it defines the story (Reese 13). i i     12   Agenda setting built on Lippmann’s ideas of the images in our heads by explaining why reporters and audiences think about those images.  Framing goes beyond Lippmann’s ideas of how personal perceptions are used to process the news media (Entman 52).   Agenda setting makes an issue more salient. Framing selects certain parts of the issue to become more salient. This puts the issue in context by explaining what the problem is, what caused the problem, how to judge its effects and how it should be evaluated or fixed (Entman 52).  It also means that part of the picture is left out.  Iyengar (Responsible 11) argues that the framing of an issue is a “contextual cue” and that these cues influence opinions and decisions.  He distinguishes between the two parts of this process; framing is different from a framing effect. Framing explains how an issue is presented, and the effect is how this changes a decision or opinions (Responsible 11). Iyengar stresses that this power to influence is not limited to naive or ignorant audiences - news directly affects public opinion of everyone (Responsible 130).  Iyengar (Responsible 14) breaks up news frames into two categories: episodic news frames and thematic news frames.  Episodic frames discuss an issue in the context of an event -- it\\'s an illustration of the subject.  Episodic framing results in making the acts or characteristics of individuals more accessible (Iyengar Responsible 14).  Thematic framing discusses an issue within a broader context.  Thematic framing occurs more often in print media than in television, and it “helps audiences to think about political issues in terms of societal and political outcomes” (Iyengar Responsible 14).  This study addressed how wood bioenergy was presented in a newspaper over nine years -- and focused on the framing trends that emerged in that time.   It did not try to break the frames into the two separate categories Iyengar discusses.  One way to identify a frame is to identify the voices that are being heard in the news (Tankard 101).  When it comes to public policy, issues generally have many stakeholders. Tankard (96) argues that media framing eliminates voices.  When an issue gets onto the public i i i    13  agenda, stakeholders start trying to frame it and establish a specific point of view (Miller and Reichert 108). They do this by highlighting certain aspects of the issue and leaving out others. The media will turn to these stakeholder groups to be used as sources in a news piece, and the group’s point of view becomes the frame (Miller and Reichert 108).  In an analysis of television network coverage of the Gulf War, more than 50% of all news reports came directly from official government spokespersons (Iyengar and Simon 256).  This practice of using the government “party-line” for news means that the government gets to frame the issue.  This affects the public’s understanding and opinions of the issue.  The audience\\'s feelings toward an issue will be similar to the government’s position (Iyengar and Simon 256).   Entman (52) explains that studying the presence or absence of key words or phrases, images, sources of information and facts or judgments used to reinforce a theme, can also identify frames.  McCombs’ first works on agenda setting built off the phrase coined by Bernard Cohen (13), that the press “may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about.”  But, as the body of research on framing grew, McCombs worked to show how agenda setting and framing worked as one theory (McCombs and Estrada 239).  McCombs claims that framing is the second dimension of agenda setting.  Together, agenda setting tells the audience what to think about and framing tells the audience how to think about these issues (McCombs and Estrada 246).  Wood bioenergy has existed in the province for a long time, but it only became a part of policy in 2007, when the BC Energy plan was released under the Liberal government.  A content analysis was performed of The Vancouver Sun’s newspaper coverage of wood bioenergy in the province.  A content analysis provides quantitative data to identify themes and perspectives i v     14  expressed in a text (Bengston and Xu 2).  Bengston and Xu (2) argue a content analysis allows one to examine the language of a text, and that language reflects a society’s values and beliefs which in turn influence the way its members think and behave.  A content analysis also allows us to examine trends over a long period of time and asses the changes in those trends (Bengston and Xu 2). Sample collection  To analyze the news media, newspaper articles from The Vancouver Sun were collected. Print media allows readers to control what they read by allowing them to select which articles they want to read, how much time they want to spend on the article and what information the reader takes away from the article.  This is different from broadcast news where a person has no choice over which pieces of news are given to them and they are forced to consume the news in a predetermined order and within a limited timeframe (Soroka 33).  Unfortunately, no recent data about consumption of forestry news by Canadians could be found.  In 1989, 51% of Canadians indicated that newspapers were their main sources of information on issues related to forestry (Environics Research Group).  The Vancouver Sun was selected as the source for newspaper articles because it is the largest daily province-wide newspaper in British Columbia, and it has the largest circulation of any paper in the province (Canadian Newspaper Association).  A provincial newspaper was used because wood bioenergy is part of the provincial government’s agenda - forests and energy fall under provincial jurisdiction.  If this were a national issue, national papers would be used (Soroka 35).  v      15  Data collection The articles were analyzed for general journalistic features: date, authour, location in paper, word count and article type.  This is a standard practice when doing a content analysis of how an issue is framed (Tankard 100).  Entman (52) explains that frames can also be identified by analyzing key words or phrases that come up often and those that are missing.  Facts or judgements can also be used to reinforce a theme (Entman 52).  Tankard (101) indicates that the lead of a story is a framing mechanism.  Often the lead explains the news element of the story although sometimes, especially with feature articles, the news is found in the nutgraph.  Miller and Reichert argue that an issue is framed in the news media based on which stakeholder group are used as sources and their point of view (108).  Tankard also identifies the selection of sources, affiliations and quotes as a framing mechanism (101).  The method for conducting the content analysis for this study was developed based on the framing mechanisms outlined by the researchers discussed above.  v i     16   Articles for this content analysis were found using a keyword search in Proquest’s Canadian Newsstand index.   Articles from The Vancouver Sun were found by performing the following searches: “wood waste,” “bioenergy,” “biomass” and “wood AND energy.” Duplicates were removed, and in the case where different versions of the same story appeared in different editions of the paper, the longest story was selected.  The reason for selecting the longest story is that as much information as possible would have been presented to readers.  Searches for other key terms that the study was looking for such as “mountain pine beetle” and “carbon neutral” were excluded because the number of articles produced was too great to pick out the few articles that would align with the study’s subject.  Similar searches for “mountain pine beetle” and “carbon neutral” with all the same parameters provided about 800 results each.  The initial set of articles was reduced further throughout the analysis when articles appeared that did not discuss wood bioenergy.  This often occurred if a person in an article had the name \"Wood,\" or the article was about waste from building materials, gardening or real estate.  Other articles were removed because they focused on biofuels.  This analysis was only interested in looking at the use of wood to produce power, not to produce gasoline for vehicles. In the instance that an article discussed the use of wood to produce a gas that could be used instead of natural gas, the article was kept in the data set.  In total 242 articles were analyzed.  Articles were retrieved starting from June 6, 2001, and ending December 31, 2009.  On June 6, 2001, Gordon Campbell’s Liberal government took power; the Liberal government has v i i    17  been very active in changing forest policy in the province.  Examples of some of the articles used in this analysis can be found in Appendix A.  The articles were analyzed for general journalistic features: date, authour, location in paper, word count and article type.  The type of articles were broken into four categories: news, feature, opinion/editorial and brief.  News articles have a sense of timeliness to them - news tends to report on important happenings within the preceding 24 hours.  The news must be gathered quickly and the information must be new, fresh and immediate (Garst and Bernstein 4). Feature stories lack the sense of timeliness, which means the information is newsworthy, but the story could appear on any particular day.  It could run tomorrow, the day after or even within the following weeks (Lanson and Stephens 343).  The section of the newspaper the articles are found in usually identifies opinions and editorials.  This category includes editorials - unattributed articles generally assumed to represent the institutional voice of the newspaper, letters to the editor, and columns which are attributed to a writer but express a distinct personal view.  For the purpose of analyzing the average word count of the articles over the course of each year, two articles 1  were removed from the data set.  These articles contained more than 4,000 words each and significantly skewed the data.  They are considered outliers.  The data collected from these articles for other parts of the analysis was left in the data set.   This paper analyzed the articles to determine which actors were quoted or used as sources the most frequently.  A group was quoted if a quote from spokesperson in that group was included in the article.  A group was mentioned if sources or information from that group were included in the article. Hessing identifies politicians, environmentalists, First Nations, industry representatives and labour groups as the major actors in BC forestry (121-31).  This study added  1  . Hume, Stephen. “Alternative energies will fill the void after the end of oil.” 15 June 2001.; Boei, William. “The new suburbia.” 6 September 2003.) v i i i   18  BC Hydro as an actor in the analysis because of the provincial crown corporation’s important role in the bioenergy industry.  A politician was defined as an elected member of government or a bureaucrat (i.e. chief forester, deputy minister of forests).  These individuals have an interest in being re-elected and / or gaining revenue for the government.  A First Nation is a person who identifies himself or herself as having a First Nations heritage.  An environmentalist is a person who supports conservation and saving the environment.  An industry representative is a person who has an interest in obtaining security for companies working in the wood products sector (this can include the bioenergy) and includes individuals from these companies.  A labour group indicates a union or someone looking for job security for a number of people working in the forest/wood processing or energy industries (Hessing 125).  A BC Hydro actor was identified as someone who works for the crown corporation.  In the case that a person represents more than one of these categories, he or she was identified as a source for whatever message he or she was promoting.  For example a First Nation who has been elected to government but who wants to preserve the forests for the sake of the environment was classified as an environmentalist.  These individuals were classified as First Nations if they want to preserve the forest for the sake of their band’s cultural values or as a politician if they were talking about the forest in terms of an election issue.  In the case that an individual represents more than one category and expresses more than one message, two categories may be indicated.  It was expected that more than one of these sources would be quoted and mentioned in each article, it is unusual to find an article with only one voice.  The wood fiber for energy production can come from a variety of waste sources including mountain pine beetle-killed trees, logging residues, mill residues, and urban waste.  The articles were analyzed to determine which source of wood was discussed in the article. i x     19   The forest industry is most active in rural British Columbia, along the coast and the interior of the province.  The urban population, centralized in the lower mainland and Victoria, has more voters and represent the environmental voters (Hoberg 337).  The location that the articles focus on was assessed in the content analysis. Urban areas were defined as Victoria, Vancouver and the lower mainland.  Rural areas of the province were defined as anything that is not urban including large cities in the interior of the province such as Prince George.  The context in which the bioenergy articles were written was analyzed as part of the content analysis.   Articles were separated into seven categories: the Ministry of Forest and Range made an announcement or began a bioenergy project; BC Hydro made an announcement or began a bioenergy project; a new policy was introduced about bioenergy; research was conducted on bioenergy; the industry began a new bioenergy project or made an announcement about the industry; a new facility was announced or started work; or some other context.  In the case where more than one of these categories would describe the article, they were both indicated.  Using wood as biomass is a contentious issue in the province (Parfitt Managing).   There are benefits to the technology but concerns about its economic sustainability and its impact on forest workers and the health of the forests.  The articles were studied to determine if any of the challenges for the bioenergy industry or any conflicting views were mentioned in the article.  An article was classified as including a conflict or challenge if it made any reference to a problem within a project or the industry.  Along with the above criteria, the articles were examined based on the questions asked in the Introduction of this paper:   x      20    Were the following terms used:  “carbon neutral” or a derivative such as “greenhouse gas neutral” “green energy” “renewable” “mountain pine beetle” or “pine beetle” or “mountain pine beetle-killed timber”    Does the article discuss how bioenergy works? This means at least two sentences were dedicated to explaining how wood is burned to produce energy.   Does the article discuss wood bioenergy in the future? This means the article addressed bioenergy 20 years in the future.  Twenty years was selected because it represents the upper shelf-life limit of the mountain pine beetle-killed wood (BC Ministry of Forests and Range 11).   Does the article address reforestation/rehabilitation? The BC Ministry of Forests and Range defines reforestation as the planting of forests on lands that have recently previously contained forests.  The article addressed reforestation/rehabilitation if there are at least two sentences dedicated to explaining how forests were restored in the passed or will be replanted or restored in the future.   Does the article address carbon balance? This means the article dedicated at least one sentence to describing how carbon was released from burning wood for bioenergy.  Alternatively the article could dedicate at least two sentences to explaining carbon sources, carbon sinks and the role of forests as carbon sinks.  Occasionally, this question was explained incorrectly in an article.  This happened frequently enough that it was counted separately. x i     21    Is wood bioenergy the focus of the story? Many of the articles mentioned wood bioenergy as part of a larger story.  An article was classified as focusing on wood bioenergy if more than half of the paragraphs discussed this idea.   Two masters of journalism candidates from UBC’s School of Journalism were given the methodology and ten randomly selected articles from the 242 used in the content analysis. They were asked to perform the analysis on each of the ten articles to test intercoder reliability. Intercoder reliability of 93% was achieved, indicating the analysis questions and definitions were appropriate for this report.  x i i    22   In total, 242 articles met the criteria for analysis.  Of that sample 25% of the articles discussed or focused on wood bioenergy for more than half of the paragraphs, while the remaining articles mentioned or dedicated a small portion of the article to discussing wood bioenergy (Figure 5).  The data were analyzed in its entirety, and the 60 articles that focused on the issue for over half the article were also isolated and analyzed separately.  The data were also separated into two time frames: 2001-2006 and 2007-2009.  The number of articles discussing wood bioenergy increased between 2001 and 2009 (Figure 1).  Because Gordon Campbell and his Liberal government did not take office until June 6, 2001, articles were only obtained starting from that date.  Seven articles were written about bioenergy between June and December of 2001.  Between 2002 and 2004, the number of articles ranged from 11 – 15 per year.  In 2005, there was an increase in the number of articles, totaling 25 that year.  Another spike occurred in 2007, when 48 articles were written about wood bioenergy.  The number of articles in 2008 remained the same as 2007, and increased slightly to 51 in 2009. After the two articles mentioned in the “Methods” section were removed from the data set because they contained more than 4,000 words each, the length of the articles was found to be consistent over time (Figure 2).  News stories accounted for 120 of the articles, or about half of the data set Opinions and editorials were the second most common type of article at almost 24% followed by features making up 16% and briefs making up 11% (Figure 3). x i i i   23  Figure 1 - The number of articles about wood bioenergy in The Vancouver Sun between June 2001 and Dec. 2009  Figure 2 - The average number of words per article between 2001 and 2009    x i v    24   Of the 242 articles, Gordon Hamilton and Scott Simpson, The Vancouver Sun’s respective forestry and energy reporters wrote 40%.  The articles were split evenly between the two reporters; Hamilton, the forestry reporter, wrote five more articles on the subject than Simpson, the energy reporter.  The remaining 60% of articles were written by various reporters and editorial contributors (Table 1).

Industry spokespeople were quoted 42% of the time and industry sources or information was included in 60% of the articles (Figure 4).  Individuals in government appeared second most frequently, followed by B.C. Hydro.  Environmentalists were quoted in 8% of articles and information or sources from environmentalists were included in 15% of articles.  First Nations were quoted in 1% of articles and the information or sources about the group appeared in almost 5%.  Labour was quoted the least and discussed the least at less than 1% and just over 2% of the time respectively.  In 38% of articles no group was quoted and in 12% of articles none of the groups were mentioned. Of the 242 articles analyzed, 19% referred to a conflict or challenge of the wood bioenergy industry.  In the group of articles that dedicated more than half the article to discussing wood bioenergy, this number increased to 33% (Figures 5 and 6). The articles were analyzed for terms that play into the idea of burning wood as an environmentally friendly method of energy production.  In the data set, the term “carbon neutral” was used in 9% of the time, “green energy” was used in 26% of articles and “renewable” was used in 18% of articles.  “Carbon neutral” was used more frequently in the articles where more than half the paragraphs dealt with wood bioenergy, 17%, than in the entire data set.   The terms “green energy” and “renewable” decreased in frequency when the more than half the article focused on the subject.    “Green” was used to describe wood bioenergy in 17 % of the articles and “renewable” was used in 3% (Figures 5 and 6).  x v i    26   Figure 4 - The frequency that sources were quoted and mentioned in the articles         0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 P e rc e n ta g e  o f a rt ic le s to  a d d re ss  e a ch  s ta k e h o ld e r (% ) Groups with a stake in the forest industry Quoted Mentioned x v i i   27   Figure 5 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in the entire data set   0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% F re q u e n cy  o f y e s/ n o  a n sw e rs  t o  f ra m in g  q u e st io n s (% ) Subject of the question Wron g No x v i i   28   Figure 6 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in the data set of articles where more than half the article discussed wood bioenergy  In total 17% of the articles in this study mentioned the pine beetle-killed wood and wood bioenergy together in the same article.  This number increased to 33% when the selection of articles was limited to those that focused on wood bioenergy (Figures 5 and 6).  Only 3% of articles in the entire data set explained how wood could be used to produce clean energy but this number increased to 10% in articles that where more than half the article focused on wood bioenergy.  This was much higher than the number of times the future of the industry was discussed, which was once in the entire sample or less than 1% of the time.

Reforestation was also discussed in only one article in the entire selection and this article did not happen to focus on wood bioenergy (Figures 5 and 6).  Articles either explained carbon balance, did not explain it or explained it incorrectly to readers.  In total, five articles discussed carbon balance correctly, or 2%.  Three of these articles were in the group where more than half the paragraphs in the article were about wood bioenergy. Almost 5% of articles in the data set went into detail about carbon balance and wood bioenergy but presented the information incorrectly and 12% of the articles where bioenergy was the subject of more than half the article explained it incorrectly.  In total, 93% of all articles did not provide any details on carbon balance nor did 83% of the focused articles (Figures 5 and 6).  The articles were analyzed when they were broken into two time frames: 2001-2006 and 2007-2009.  Some of the information conveyed in the articles was not significantly different between the two time frames; other pieces of information were significantly different.  The number of articles that dealt with bioenergy for more than half the article remained fairly constant.  Throughout the data set about 25% of articles focused on bioenergy (Figure 5). Almost 29% of articles focused on bioenergy between 2001 and 2006; between 2007 and 2009, it was 24%.  Articles that explained how wood can be burned to produce energy and carbon balance also did not vary significantly between the two time frames.  The process of how bioenergy works was discussed in 2% of articles prior to 2007 and in 4% of articles in the second data set.  Carbon balance was explained correctly in 1% of articles prior to 2007 and in 2% of articles after that date (Figures 7 and 8).  Only one article in the data set discussed the future of the bioenergy industry and only one article discussed reforestation.  In each case these articles were found in the second data set, years 2007-2009. x x     30   The term “green energy” was used in about 26% of articles over the data set.  This did not change a great deal.  It was used only 22% of the time prior to 2007 and 28% of the time from 2007-2009 (Figures 7 and 8).  Differences were noted between the two time frames with the use of the terms “carbon neutral” and “renewable” and how frequently the mountain pine beetle was discussed in conjunction with wood bioenergy.  Prior to 2007, the term “carbon neutral” or variations of it, was used in 2% of the articles.  After 2007, the term was used in 13% of articles.  The term renewable was used in 11% of the articles analyzed prior to 2007.  This number doubles to 22% after 2007.  In 8% of the articles prior to 2007 mountain pine beetle-killed wood was discussed, but between 2007-2009 this number jumps to 24% (Figures 7 and 8).  The frequency that the conflicts or challenges of developing a wood bioenergy industry come up in articles, changes slightly between the two time frames and decreases in the later years.  Prior to 2007, 22% of articles discuss obstacles, while after 17% do the same.  Over the data set the conflicts or challenges are discussed 19% of the time (Figures 7 and 8). x x i    31  Figure 7 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in articles written between 2001 and 2006   0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% F re q u e n cy  o f y e s/ n o  a n sw e rs  t o  f ra m in g  q u e st io n s b e tw e e n  2 0 0 1 - 2 0 0 6  ( % ) Subject of question wrong no yes x x i i   32   Figure 8 - The frequency of yes and no answers to the analysis questions in articles written between 2007 and 2009 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% F re q u e n cy  o f y e s/ n o  a n sw e rs  t o  f ra m in g  q u e st io n s b e tw e e n  2 0 0 7 - 2 0 0 9  ( % ) Subject of question wrong now yes x x i i   33   The keyword searches for wood bioenergy articles yielded 242 articles for analysis between June 6, 2001, when Gordon Campbell’s Liberal government took power in the province, and the end of 2009.  When the data set is considered together, it does not support the study’s hypothesis that wood bioenergy is being framed as a carbon neutral energy source and as a solution to the mountain pine beetle epidemic.  But, when the data is analyzed for changes in trends over time, the study shows that the articles were more likely to be framed according to the hypothesis after 2007.  These trends are discussed in more detail below:  The number of articles written throughout each year of the analysis increased over time as was expected to happen.  The first big jump occurred in 2005, and there was another spike in 2007.   In 2007, the British Columbia government announced its goals to cut carbon emissions, become energy self-sufficient and use renewable energy (  1-2).  These policies were outlined in the BC Energy Plan and later, in 2008, the province released the BC Bioenergy Strategy.  BC Hydro collaborated with the government on these plans and targets. Following the release of these documents, BC Hydro put out two separate calls for project proposals and has accepted four projects by this study’s conclusion.  These actions explain why news coverage increased in 2007 and remained at that level.  In addition to provincial wood bioenergy projects, companies and groups are also beginning to use wood burning technology to produce power.  An example of this is the new Dockside Green development in Victoria.  This new neighbourhood is powered by Nexterra’s wood gasification system.  x x i v   34    Across the literature, researchers emphasized the importance of determining which voices were heard in the news media.  This study monitored how frequently the following groups were consulted by : government, BC Hydro, industry, labour, environmentalists and First Nations.  The most striking finding of this study revealed that the voice of Aboriginal groups was consistently missing in the articles about wood bioenergy.  When compared to the frequency that government voices are used as sources in the same set of articles, the elimination of First Nations’ voices is even more pronounced (Figure 4).  First Nations spokespeople were only quoted in about 1% of articles compared to government spokespeople, who were quoted 29% of the time.  Moreover government sources and information were included in more than 50% of wood bioenergy articles whereas Aboriginal sources were noted less than 5% of the time.  This polarity is particularly shocking when one considers the efforts the provincial government had gone to in recent years to work with First Nations in a more productive way. Establishing a “new relationship” with First Nations was arguably the Liberal government’s biggest accomplishment and most significant change. ( ).   This “new relationship” has been particularly important in the forestry sector. Delgamuukw, Haida, and Tsilhqot’in all had successful court cases throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s against the province and industry groups over lack of consultation (Palmer ).  The rulings from these cases indicated the fundamental importance of more fully consulting with and accommodating Aboriginal groups, especially when issues over the use of x x v    35  natural resources occurred on lands that they had claims to.  Gordon Campbell’s government responded by taking a new attitude toward First Nations groups (Palmer ). It was decided that consulting with First Nation groups prior to making forestry decisions was no longer sufficient because the individuals were more than just stakeholders.  Now, First Nations are analogous to the provincial government.  Other actions in the forestry sector also demonstrate the new relationship.  As part of the Forestry Revitalization Plan in 2004, 8% of the land taken back by the government to establish a market based pricing system, was given to First Nation groups (13-14).  This change has not been reflected in the reporting of wood bioenergy in  – information about Aboriginal groups was only included in 5% of the articles. The impact of this in public opinion and policy is discussed in more detail below.  A limit of this study is that it does not explain why certain voices have been left out. Further research should aim to answer this question.  Specifically it would be important to study First Nation representation in the news across all forest topics to determine if the news media has reflected the changes in the province’s attitudes towards First Nations and, if not, to investigate the reasons for this.  This content analysis found that the voice of labour groups was also consistently left out. This was significant because of the number of forest and mill workers who have lost their jobs since 2007.  One frequent criticism of the wood bioenergy industry is the potential impact it might have on pulp and paper mills.  In the articles from  the sources of wood for bioenergy were most often mill residues and mountain pine beetle-killed wood. The use of mill residues as a source of bioenergy is the primary cause of concern for the pulp and paper industry.  Fiber from mills and the pine trees were each mentioned almost twice as often as any other source of wood for bioenergy. x x v i   36   The environmental actors were also consulted less frequently than other groups -- environmental quotes appeared in less than 10% of the articles and information and sources from that group was mentioned in about 15% of articles.  This finding was not surprising because of the current relationship between the forest industry and environmental groups.  After an agreement was reached to protect the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, environmentalists took a step back from focusing on forest issues.  Instead, groups such as Greenpeace focused on other environmental matters such as the tar sands.  First Nations, labour groups and environmentalists were thus unable to frame and shape how bioenergy initiatives were portrayed in The Vancouver Sun.  The opinions and attitudes of these groups were not found in the articles and thus the public does not have access to them. This means the public is getting a skewed or narrowly defined idea of the issues and concerns of using wood bioenergy.  The issues and concerns of First Nations, labour groups and environmentalists cannot influence the public opinion of this technology because they are not included in the articles being read by The Vancouver Sun audience.  The voices that are included determine public opinion and set the agenda (Lippmann 12).  They also determine the frame and decide the aspects of an issue that get discussed (Entman 52).  These frames play a role in the decisions that are made – forming public policy. This study does not suggest that  intentionally left out First Nations, labour groups and environmentalists in an effort to frame bioenergy a certain way.  This study did not investigate why a quote from a group of actors was included or how the reporting was conducted.  This study only suggests that the audience of will not hear what these groups have to say about the growing bioenergy industry.  The omission of these voices may tie into why the conflicts and challenges of this industry were only discussed in about 20% of articles. x x v i   37   This study found that the voice of the industry, government and BC Hydro came up the most often in articles from (Figure 4).  Out of all groups, the industry’s voice is heard the most  industry was quoted in 42% of all articles.  This means the industry has a major role in setting the agenda and framing wood bioenergy (Lippmann 12). What is less clear is the position of the forest industry on wood bioenergy.  Economically the industry has been harmed by the financial situation in the United States and Canada, and there is reason to look for new and innovative revenue streams.  But, there are apprehensions about bioenergy development and the ability to secure long term access to trees.  It is hard to identify how this group would frame the issue because different voices in this group could be saying different things. It is also clear that BC Hydro and the government, who are in favour of promoting and developing wood bioenergy in the province, play a major role in determining the frame and setting the agenda.  These groups have initiatives in place to expand the wood bioenergy industry and want the public to support these plans.  This indicates that the aspects of wood bioenergy the government and BC Hydro would highlight would be the positive aspects.   The specific issues these groups have made more salient by being able to frame the issue are more clearly identified by looking at the second half of the study – focusing on the language and messages that appear in the articles.  The first question used to analyze framing in bioenergy articles from examined the use of specific keywords and phrases.  In this study, the articles were analyzed for the following keywords: “carbon neutral,” “green energy,” “renewable” and “mountain pine beetle.”  These words or phrases were identified as being in line with how the provincial government and BC Hydro wanted to frame the issue. x x v i   38   Overall these phrases were used in fewer than 50% of the articles, and even when more than half the content of an article discussed wood bioenergy, the frequency was low.   This was surprising until the data was isolated into two separate time periods.  Articles written prior to 2007 -- the year when the provincial government announced its new environmental initiatives and developed the BC Energy Plan -- were less likely to include the above keywords, while some of these keywords and phrases doubled in frequency after 2007 (Figure 7 and 8).  The most significant increase was observed in the use of the term “carbon neutral”.  Prior to 2007, it was used in 2% of articles, and increased to being included in 13% of articles after 2007.  This is six times more frequently.  Renewable energy came up twice as frequently after 2007, appearing in 22% of articles.  References to mountain pine beetle-killed wood almost tripled, becoming a common phrase in about 24% of articles (Figure 8).  This indicates that the frame shifted around 2007 and wood bioenergy was discussed as a solution to environmental problems -- the message the government and BC Hydro have been promoting.  This change is particularly interesting when considered in conjunction with other analysis questions. As the terms “carbon neutral,” “renewable” and “green energy” were used more frequently after 2007, it could be assumed that the terms would be qualified or explained.  For example using the term carbon neutral is almost useless without an explanation of the role of forests in maintaining carbon balance.  The term carbon neutral was used six times more frequently after 2007 while an explanation of carbon balance only increased from 1% to less than 3%.  No observable change was noticed in how frequently carbon balance was explained incorrectly across the two time periods -- this happened in around 5% of all articles. This suggests that  was using the language offered by the government without x x i x   39  trying to put it in context.  One of the provincial government’s energy policies says that all new electricity generation projects would produce no greenhouse gas emissions. Providing readers with context is one way to be objective in the news media (Kovach and Rosentiel 80-110).  The more objective the articles are, the less likely it is that the actors can frame an issue in the media and influence the opinion of the public. The articles frame burning wood as a carbon neutral practice, but they don’t make any effort to explain where this carbon comes from or the role that forests play in both storing and releasing carbon.  For the term “renewable” to make sense, it also needs to be qualified.  For trees to be considered a renewable resource means new trees have to be planted and allowed to grow for a specific amount of time.  This amount of time has been hotly debated -- trees should provide a minimum amount of ecological benefit to the area and should stand long enough to be a carbon sink (meaning the length of time a tree will continue to store more carbon than it produces).  It is believed that the longer a tree stands, the more carbon it stores (Parfitt  29). “Renewable” was used in twice as many articles after 2007, increasing from 11% to 22%.  While this term became more common in the discussion, only one article in the data set went into reforestation.  This was a surprising result because reforestation is the responsibility of the tenure holder, the group cutting down the trees, not nature.  Articles seem to lack context if trees are described as renewable without an explanation of who is responsible for this.  This finding indicates that  was framing bioenergy as a renewable energy resource.  One of the provincial government’s energy policies is that 90% of energy will come from renewable sources. l      40   Prior to 2007, 8% of articles discussed wood bioenergy in conjunction with mountain pine beetle-killed wood.  After 2007, almost 24% of articles did this.  When bioenergy and mountain pine beetle are discussed together, it gives the reader a sense that pine beetle killed- wood will be used for bionergy projects.  Despite the increase of this message in the news media over time, the bioenergy projects in the province do not reflect this increase.  As discussed earlier, the first call for bioenergy yielded no mountain pine beetle projects.  Approved projects from the second call for power were not announced prior to the study’s completion.  In conversations with Forest Minister Pat Bell, he explained that mountain pine beetle-killed wood will play a role in the future bioenergy industry but the majority of the wood fiber for bioenergy will come from logging residues.   This message is not consistent with previous statements from the ministry and provincial government (BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. 6) nor is it reflected in the news coverage of the issue.   This indicates that wood bioenergy is being framed as a solution to the mountain pine beetle epidemic.  Residents of British Columbia are aware of the damage caused by the mountain pine beetle, and the number of beetle-killed trees that would be available for bioenergy projects.  Failing to explain that this is not where the majority of the wood comes from seems unfair to the audience who rely on  to form opinions on forest issues and energy policies.  This would not help to promote a relationship of trust between the public and the news media (Kovach and Rosentiel 52-3).  The results of this study indicate that the The Vancouver Sun has framed bioenergy according to the messages of BC Hydro and the provincial government.  The elements that has selected to frame wood bioenergy are that it is carbon neutral and a l i     41  renewable energy source that can solve the mountain pine beetle epidemic.  As explained earlier this has the power to effect the public’s perception of this idea.  Bioenergy should be something the public understands correctly.  A commonly cited problem with the explanation of environmental issues or green products is that the information is confusing.  If bioenergy is pursued as a power source and the province becomes reliant on it to contribute energy to the grid, the public may feel duped when their preconceived notions of this industry are shown to be untrue. l i i    42  BC Ministry of Forests.

Vancouver, B.C.:Oct 18, 2006.  p. D8  (501  words)  PRINCE RUPERT -- A partnership between Canadian Forest Products, Pinnacle Pellet and the Moricetown First Nation will see wood pellets travel through Prince Rupert and overseas in order to lower greenhouse gas emissions in Japan. Leroy Reitsma, business development manager with Canfor, said the pellets that will be moving through Prince Rupert\\'s Ridley Terminals in 2007 will be sent to Japan where they will be used in a coal displacement project. The coal-fired electrical generation facility in Japan is being converted to burn pellets. \"It\\'s all about reducing the use of coal and meeting targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Reitsma. The wood pellet plant is part of a larger project that includes the installation of a new bark-fired energy system at the Houston Canfor sawmill in the northern Interior. The combination of the wood pellet plant and the bark-fired energy system provides an economically viable, value-added alternative to beehive burners. Since 1968 when Canfor opened a sawmill in Houston, 16 million gigajoules of energy in the form of bark and sawdust have simply been expelled into the atmosphere -- a value of $300 million. \"When you look at that, there has to be a better way,\" he said. Reitsma went on to explain Canfor\\'s sawmill in Houston produces three types of waste: bark removed from the outside of the logs; sawdust produced when logs are cut; and shavings left over from planing the logs to size after they have been dried. Previously, the debris was put into a beehive burner, but provincial regulations required Canfor to phase out the burner by 2007. In 2004, Canfor began working with Pinnacle Pellet to market pellets made from waste wood using heat and high pressure. That left the question of what to do with the bark. it\\'s now burned at the sawmill and provides the heat required for both lumber and pellet production. The project is also an opportunity for Canfor to further their relationship with the Moricetown Band. They already do business with Kyahwood Forest Products -- a joint venture between the two parties that directly employs 75 people in Moricetown in lumber remanufacturing. l v i i   48  In addition to sending the pellets through a silo storage facility at Ridley Terminals and on to Japan, the partnership will also sell product into the U.S. \"We are working with Ridley Terminals to ship wood pellets and we are working with CN to use their Prairie train car fleet to back- haul to U.S. markets,\" said Reitsma Pellets are proving a popular alternative to the high cost of natural gas, said Reitsma. Before they had financing they were able to sell out the product for the first five years. \"We are currently producing pellets on budget and most important of all, all of our partners are on the same page.\" In addition, turning biomass into energy is part of a strategy to keep Canfor competitive in the current lumber market, he said \"Wood residue is an asset that must be used to improve our competitive position.\" l i x    49  Forest industry faces major changes; Much of B.C.\\'s wood supply will be used for bioenergy instead of pulp and lumber, expert says:[Final Edition] Gordon Hamilton. The Vancouver Sun.Vancouver, B.C.:May 11,2007.  p. H1 (714 words)  Natural Resources: The B.C. forest industry turned in one of the world\\'s worst performances in 2006, but a transformation of historic proportions is just over the horizon, one of the province\\'s leading industry consultants said Thursday. PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Craig Campbell said traditional pulp and lumber production, particularly in the pine beetle-ravaged Interior, is going to give way to bioenergy, smoothing over the boom- and-bust cycles that characterize the industry today. Campbell\\'s forecast of a prosperous future comes at a time when the industry is the world\\'s basket case. He said mountains of logs are piling up alongside forest roads today because companies cannot economically convert them to lumber. The industry tumbled from the world\\'s top performing region two years ago, when it had $1.5 billion in profits, to the bottom of the heap in 2006, losing $500 million, according to findings released Thursday by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Further, return on capital employed -- a key indicator of financial health -- dropped to -1.8 per cent as the industry fought against the mountain pine beetle infestation, a depressed U.S. housing market and a soaring Canadian dollar, Campbell said at PWC\\'s 20th Global Forest and Paper Industry Conference. Lumber prices are bumping along the bottom but he said he sees no sign that they are going to improve soon. Despite the bad performance, Campbell said huge changes are under way -- a consequence of the mountain pine beetle infestation -- that will transform the province\\'s wood products industry from reliance on cyclical commodities to more stable energy production. \"The next five years in the B.C. forest industry are going to be without a doubt the biggest transformation we will ever see,\" Campbell told the 500 people attending the conference. The pine beetle is the greatest challenge and, as wood quality deteriorates in the dead pine stands, less of it will be suitable for lumber. \"The outlook is very bleak for the Interior sawmilling industry. Dozens of sawmills are going to close.\" He said that in the Interior, 15 million cubic metres of timber - - enough lumber to fill half a million logging trucks -- is going to waste in huge roadside piles because it cannot be economically converted to lumber. Other factors driving the change include:     50   Ownership of the industry is changing rapidly, with new investors buying stakes in B.C. companies.  Softwood duty refunds injected a $2.5-billion windfall that PWC did not include in its earnings report.  Carbon credits trading is coming, adding a new source of revenue. It all adds up to \"big opportunities for biomass energy using beetle wood,\" Campbell said. In a later interview, Campbell said the industry is buzzing over the potential of electrical generation. BC Hydro has committed to promoting bioenergy and the key question remaining is what kind of subsidy it will offer producers. \"We are getting phone calls to do studies for energy companies vis a vis the wood supply. There is a lot of momentum and interest. That\\'s where I see we are going to shift: from traditional lumber to energy.\" He sounded a note of caution on subsidies, however, saying that in Europe subsidies to energy producers lead to higher wood prices, forcing some traditional wood-products manufacturers out of business. Mark Connelly, investment analyst with Credit Suisse, said diversifying into energy production looks like a smart move, but he questioned how ready B.C. companies are to diversify, noting many have not diversified out of the region, a basic financial strategy. \"One of the reasons B.C. wood companies have such a problem is that they are B.C. companies,\" he said. \"What you have here, in my mind, is an industry that locked itself into a region that now suddenly has a real problem,\" he said, referring to the beetle. \"Every time you read a money- management thing, it says diversify. And B.C. didn\\'t.\" Both Campbell and Connelly noted that the face of the industry is changing as activist investors buy stakes. Campbell singled out B.C. billionaire Jim Pattison, Montreal\\'s Stephen Jarislowsky and New York-based Third Avenue Management, which has a $800-million investment in B.C. companies. He said the industry needs to consolidate beyond what has taken place already. \"The question looms whether Third Avenue will role its pulp assets all under one banner,\" he said. i      51  New independent power could add $26.1 billion to B.C. economy: report Scott Simpson.  The Vancouver Sun.  Vancouver, B.C.:Nov 3, 2009.  p. C.7 (546 words)  The independent power sector could inject $26.1 billion into the British Columbia economy by 2020, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study to be released today in Vancouver.  The report, commissioned by the Independent Power Producers Association of B.C., says $26.1 billion in capital investment could generate $9 billion for economic growth over the next 11 years -- representing a 4.5-per-cent increase in the size of the provincial economy.  PwC is still polishing the report and expects to release an authoritative version before year\\'s end.  A draft version is being presented today to IPPBC members at their annual conference. IPPs are now working through a BC Hydro call for power that seeks 6,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of new green energy from wind, run-of-river hydro, bioenergy and other renewable sources of electricity.  But the report says IPPs could deliver more than four times that amount -- 26,500 GWh -- to the grid by 2020. The numbers are not far-fetched -- Hydro\\'s most recent call received bids totalling 17,000 GWh, and there are many projects around the province still in earlier stages of development.  Some of the electricity could be used to develop a substantial export industry -- producing 12,000 GWh per year to sell to green-power-eager markets in the United States. But the report also notes that electricity demand within B.C. could absorb all 26,500 gigawatt hours if new high-density office and residential buildings opt for electric heating instead of natural gas.  Total employment impacts from IPPs, at that level of development, would reach 87,000 person- years, and government revenues generated through the construction phase of potential IPP projects are estimated at $1.6 billion, the report says.  PwC says the Central Interior would realize the greatest benefit from biomass projects -- which require waste wood for fuel -- because it is the hub of B.C.\\'s forest industry.  The Lower Mainland-South Coast has the greatest potential for benefit from run of river development.

Between June 25 and 27, with the world’s political and economic leaders concealed behind a six-kilometer, $5 million fence, (Kirton M1) tens of thousands of social movement members1, individual protesters2 and onlookers converged on the streets of Toronto. Participants sought to use the G8-G20 as a forum to get national and international media coverage and to encourage a public conversation about a variety of Canadian and global social justice issues and Canada’s role and objectives within the international diplomatic community. The news frame that Canadians witnessed was not a conversation but instead a cacophony: burning police cars, broken windows and cops marching in riot gear. The Canadian audience saw, heard and read about confusing, turbulent clashes among social movements organizations, protesters, residents, police, onlookers and the media that covered the event -- which culminated in the arrest of more than 900 people -- Canada’s largest-ever mass arrest (Gray A1). Throughout the summit weekend, it became increasingly difficult for Canadians to differentiate between the crass and destructive minority (which absorbed the bulk of the media’s attention) and the reflexive, organized and communicative majority of protesters whose narrative got lost in the riot story.  1 The G8-G20 in June 2010 hosted a complex, fluid and intersectional array of individuals, organizations and networks with varying commitments, interests and objectives. For the sake of consistency and clarity in this study the term social movement organization (a well- discussed term in its own right among social movement scholars) will be used to characterize protest groups. Mario Diani (1992) provides a “synthetic definition” of social movements that is suitable for the purposes of this paper: “A social movement is a network of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in a political or cultural conflict, on the basis of a shared collective identity.” (13) 2 In instances where no discernable, relevant network or organizational structures applies, individual demonstrators will be called protesters.  2 This study takes a timely snap shot of how the Globe and Mail  -- Canada’s foremost national publication -- covered protest during the G8-G20 in Ontario. It looks at the Globe’s use of language and its construction of coverage regarding social movements and protesters. In other words, this paper explores the Globe’s protester frame. In the current journalistic environment -- which is clearly in technological, social, and economic transformation -- it’s important to pause and assess how the Globe situates itself within large-scale, public disruption to local, national and global order. The Globe was selected because it is Canada’s largest national daily paper of record (second to only the Toronto Star, a paper with a larger circulation, but one that is primarily regional). Another motivating factor in selecting the Globe is its identity and marketability as an elite publication, and one that can legitimate public discourse3. With the Globe as my source, I searched Factiva for all articles including: “G8 or G20 and Protests or Protesters.” I cross-referenced those findings (47 articles) with the Globe’s G8-G20 summit hub website which provided an additional 15 articles for a total sample of 62 articles including news stories, editorials, columns, features, profiles, and analysis. My sample includes articles from June 24, 2010 to July 1, 2010. The date parameters were selected to catch anticipatory stories filed on the two days before the summit, plus two days during the summit to collect breaking news reports, and four days of follow-up, analysis and editorial coverage throughout the following week. I looked for:  3 According to Media-Corps, the Globe and Mail’s international advertising representative, the Globe reaches more Canadians with: University educations, household incomes of more than $125,000, personal incomes of more than $100,000, senior management positions, and more professional positions than any other Canadian newspaper. http://media- corps.com/Media-Corps_print_globeandmail.html  3 1.) SOURCES: instances of primary reliance on attributed official sources such as politicians, business leaders, police leadership, or spokespeople (Gitlin 1980; Paletz, Entman 1981; Schudson 2003; Gans 2003); 2.) MARGINALIZATION OF PROTESTORS: descriptions, language and primary/dominant frames that emphasized violence and civic disruption (Gitlin 1980; Ashley, Olson 1998; Gans 2003; Boyle et al 2005; Boykoff 2006); 3.) TRIVILIZATION OF PROTESTORS: coverage that showed disparagement by numbers, disparagement on the basis of identity, undermining tone, frivolous quotation marks (Gitlin 1980; Lee, Craig 2002; Ashley, Olson 1998); and 4.) DISSENTING FRAMES: that introduced first person accounts of the protests by social movement activists, or primary frames that contested official or hostile narratives about the protests or protesters. I tallied those findings and then pulled relevant examples into my overall analysis of the coverage while acknowledging fundamental scholarship on media framing and social movement theory. Research question: As Canada’s national paper of record, how did the Globe and Mail explore themes and messages brought forth by SMOs, and protesters during the G8-G20? Hypothesis: The Globe, throughout the G8-G20 adhered to a dominant discourse in favour of the status quo. The Globe’s social, economic and cultural identity conforms to a particular hegemonic ideology -- pro-business, pro-civic stability and pro-status quo -- and the newspaper as an institution found itself at odds with protesters and their messaging resulting in a coverage of protest that emphasized violence and disruption to political, social and economic order.  4 1.1 Background: The G8-G20  Rambouillet, France played host to the first G7 in 19754. Participants included France, Germany, the UK, the US, Japan and Italy. Canada was added for the 1976 summit in Puerto Rico, and representatives from the European Community attended in 1977. The annual meeting between the world’s largest industrial economies was arranged to discuss issues including macroeconomics, international trade, development, east-west relations, terrorism, human rights, arms control, and energy resources. Russia first attended in 1994 and rounded out the G8 as a full member in 1998 at the summit in Birmingham. After economic and financial crisis in the late 1990s, finance ministers from the G8 suggested that a secondary informal meeting be held among the G8’s finance ministers, central bank managers, and representatives from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the suggestion of then-Canadian finance minister Paul Martin, the meetings were expanded to include representatives from emerging economies as a way to comprehensively deliberate and discuss global economic issues. The G20 was first held informally in 1999, and consisted of the G8, plus the European Union and was joined by Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, China, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Australia. In 2008, George W. Bush invited the G20 heads of state to Washington DC for an official summit. The joint G8-G20 in Toronto and Huntsville marked the fourth episode, and it’s been decided that the G20 will continue to meet annually, each fall. France will host in 2011, followed by a summit in Mexico in 20125.   4 Information on G8 origins from University of Toronto’s G8 Information Centre: http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/what_is_g8.html 5 Information on G20 origins from University of Toronto’s G20 Information Centre: http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/g20whatisit.html  5 2    Chapter: Literature Review  2.1 Protest, freedom and democracy  Healthy, enduring, democratic communities rely on active exchanges of ideas, opinions and information (Dewey 1922; Freire 2005). In the Canadian context the Globe and Mail has the privilege of facilitating those exchanges. We must look at an institution like the Globe and ask whether it’s providing Canadians with information that is needed to exercise freedom, hold leaders to account and nourish democracy. Our system of governance is constructed with democratic institutions but that framework is only a mechanism to secure the idea of democracy. Active -- even turbulent -- communication has to be the primary ingredient in the recipe for great, sustainable, democratic communities. Knowledge and wisdom cannot be created in a vacuum and grows best out of active interaction and exchange (Dewey 144). The press remains the prime facilitator. Without criticism and without holding truth to power -- one of the fourth estate’s ideal objectives -- freedom is fleeting. Individuals, communities, societies, and countries must reject the “fear of freedom,” and seek humanization through accountability and responsibility (Freire 2005). “Liberation is…a childbirth, and a painful one (51). Freedom, as we enjoy it in Canada, requires reflection, solidarity, dialogue and vocal, visible action. The best venue for this action is our public spaces -- our streets. Toronto, during the G8-G20, presented an opportunity for comprehensive and far-ranging public dialogue pertaining to an array of social justice disorders at home and abroad. 2.2 Frame theory  The central focus in this study is how news gets framed (Tuchman 1978; Gitlin 1980; Ashley, Olson 1998; Entman 2003; Gans 2003). When journalists report a story there is a  6 series of decisions that must get made while reporting in the field and while crafting the news story back in the newsroom. What is the tone? Who gets a voice? What is the purpose? What gets emphasized? De-emphasized? What’s the angle? The sum of all of those parts is the story’s frame (Tuchman 5). Who gets a voice in the story is one of the most important aspects of the news frame. When political or business leaders have something to say, the press usually listens attentively and reports it (Gans 52). Official or authoritative sources have the opportunity to set the news frame and to even influence what language gets used to tell a story (Entman 2003). Official press conferences, typically closed to the public, are the primary intersection for reporters and leaders (415). It’s at these contained, arranged and structured events that most public policy narratives originate. When the media relies on information and language provided by officials and leaders, news organizations participate in cultural strumming (Entman 2003). By “strumming” officials’ talking points, the media can reproduce news frames posited from the top-down. This “cascading activation” sets in motion a cultural logic that permeates communities and spreads through popular discourse (418). Like a waterfall, discourse flows down to lower levels from higher ones. The water (discourse) mixes with other perspectives and then over time eventually finds its way back to the origins of the system creating a dominant frame. It is possible that the result is hegemonic social and cultural congruence, a level of acceptability for any given subject or news story. Another ingredient in a news frame is the overall treatment of voices, characters and participants. The way that protesters during the G8-G20 were framed reminds of experiences by other challenges to the status quo. Studies of media framing have found de-legitimization  7 of protester messaging by using undermining quotation marks (Ashley, Olson 1998). Media coverage of protest movements or protest events has also been found to trivialize protesters on the basis of appearance and dress (Gitlin 1980; Ashley, Olson 1998). Furthermore, newspaper coverage has been shown to emphasize internal dissension and undercount participants while contrasting protesters against other favoured counter- movements more congruent with the media outlet’s economic, political and cultural sensibilities (Ashley, Olson 266, 268, 269; Gitlin 27; Lee, Craig 1992). It’s important then to consider whether the Globe afforded G8-G20 protesters a straight face while covering social justice action for the Canadian public. As much as a news frame is a sum of many parts (voices, words, tone) it’s also a lens through which the world is viewed. Like a window frame, a news frame’s quality depends on many variables (Tuchman 1978). Variables like size, vantage point, clarity, shape, can either reveal or blur a vision of the outside landscape (1). Part of understanding where those elements come from is recognizing that news is “first and foremost a social institution” (Tuchman 1978; Chomsky 1997; Gans 2003). The media’s institutional construct depends a variety of different political and economic entities (corporate parent companies, advertisers and government) and they can impact how information gets framed. If one of these sections, or individuals within them, want to float an idea or a perspective through the media, they can. Ordinary citizens are rarely provided an opportunity to express their interests, feelings and impressions (Tuchman, 4). The structure of the newsroom also plays a role in how dominant frames get established. News is increasingly a mass production built within an environment similar to that of a factory (Gans 49). In recent years the urgency within news production has  8 intensified. News organizations continue to produce daily iterations of the paper, but they must also update the web regularly while posting to various social media outlets. This perpetual news grind and continuous cycle limits a reporter’s ability to comprehensively gather news. One of the side effects is that reporters increasingly rely on official sources and oversimplify narratives in order to keep the news flowing while holding the reader’s precarious attention (Gans 49, 52, 61). The factory-esque construction of news may diminish the opportunity for covering stories about social movements and protest in a way that teases out complexity, reflexivity and nuance. Urgency begets simplicity and the simplest stories at the G8-G20 were burning cars, broken windows and violence on the streets. When assessing the protester frame wrought by the Globe and Mail I drew from Gitlin’s seminal frame analysis (1980). He found that CBS and the New York Times: 1) trivialized protesters (by making light of language, dress, age, style and goals, and by disparaging on the basis of numbers and effectiveness). 2) Marginalized protesters (by portraying demonstrators as deviant or unrepresentative, and by amplifying violence and communist imagery); and 3) relied disproportionately on official sources (government officials, police etc) to set the frame of the news story and to interpret the issues for the public (27). 2.3 Stereotypes  Stereotypes are a quick and easy way to establish a news frame. When building narratives and telling stories the media (and most individuals) resort to stereotypical or symbolic portrayals (Lippmann 1922; Gitlin 1980). People often communicate based on the images in their heads, rather than through substantive criticism, observations and engagement (Lippmann 77). When a reporter or publication is packaging a story, limited time and space  9 forces boiled-down versions of comments, events and observations resulting in easily digested baseline narratives (Gitlin 230). One of the elements of news frames that this study considers when assessing the Globe and Mail’s coverage is its use of intellectual shorthand. How did the paper portray, describe and characterize protesters? 2.4 Ideology, hegemony and the news  The way we talk (or write) about things is the one of the drivers of ideology and hegemony (Lee, Craig 1992). Media frames enacted upon protesters can draw them either within the margins of public discourse or can push them to the fringes. The way that a protest event, a protest organization or a social movement gets framed can have lasting consequences on how those entities operate and deliver their messaging to the public (Gitlin, 1980). In the 1960s, hostile coverage of the Students for Democratic Society -- a multi-issue social movement organization that led the resistance to the Vietnam War -- pushed the organization to social and political margins. The corporate media (the New York Times and CBS, in this case) were unable and/or unwilling to disrupt the hegemonic discourse constructed and maintained by U.S. political, economic and social elite -- of which those two organizations were a part. A convergence of factors including newsgathering routines (reliance on official sources), framing tendencies, and the inability of the SDS to handle increased attention and membership growth caused tensions within the organization regarding how to engage the public and express their mandate. Within a couple of years of first finding the spotlight, the SDS found itself increasingly radicalized and on the fringes of the public conversation about U.S. foreign policy, the war, and participatory democracy.  10 It’s important to consider sociological studies of framing while acknowledging political and social power as a driving force for elite hegemonic discourse (Carragee, Roefs, 2006). Too often scholars wield notions of framing without thinking about the causes of those frames, relying heavily on assessments of the effects of media filters and outputs (216). To think about how the media situates itself within social, political and economic power it’s worthwhile to draw scholars such as Tuchman (1978), Gitlin (1980), Gamson (1992), and Entman (1993) back into the fold of framing research because those scholars thought of framing as a fluid, reciprocal, and intersecting process. The media is not an insular thing. It’s made up of individuals who are just as vulnerable to cultural, social and political influences as anybody else, and those individuals are making decisions in the newsroom. To understand how any media organization works, it’s important to understand its institutions (Chomsky 1997). Whether it’s CBS, the New York Times, (or the Globe and Mail) -- those organizations’ institutional structures lend themselves to upholding the political, economic and social status quo to the detriment of social change (3). Mostly, media organizations like the Globe are large, profitable, corporate entities, and many are linked to corporate conglomerates outside of the media industry. These institutions are by nature tyrannical -- if there is dissention in the lower levels of the structure, the only option for the dissenter is to exit the organization (2). The Globe like other elite, media companies relies on readers who are typically affluent and politically, economically or socially mobilized. Business leaders, University experts, government spokespeople, and other media elites also typify the sorts of voices found in the paper. Reliance on those sorts of readers and sources foster echo chambers that construct adherence and conformity (4). When it comes to reporting, it’s not that journalists are  11 prevented from doing their job properly or independently, it’s that organizations resist individuals with divisive perspectives and they weed out individuals who refuse to conform to the approved status quo (4). The outcome of institutional perpetuity and congruence is that major players in the media can actually preserve the legitimacy of political, economic and social systems (Paletz, Entman 1981). By failing to access alternative voices outside the institutional and structural power brokers, the media decrease the ability of ordinary citizens to exercise their own power, their own voices (6). 2.5 The global justice movement  What took place during the G8-G20 was clearly more complex and diverse than one group or a single SMO reacting and protesting to a single social justice issue. Much like what happened during the WTO meetings in Seattle in 19996, the protests in Toronto had the flavour of a global justice movement (Boykoff 2006). Many different antagonistic frames were put forth by the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, ABC, CBS, FOX, CNN, and NBC during the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle (Boykoff 2006). Five different framing filters emerged from the media coverage of the Seattle protesters: the violence frame, the disruption frame, the freak frame, the ignorance frame and the amalgam of grievances frame7. That framework of framing provides a good point of reference when assessing how  6 Jules Boykoff (2006) found it worthwhile to consolidate the plethora of social justice concerns and activists during the media’s portrayal of Seattle’s “jamboree of teamsters, and turtle protectors” and “astonishing array of causes, costumes and voices” into the notion of the global justice movement. 7 Boykoff’s framework combined with Gitlin’s provided my study with the criteria to judge how the Globe and Mail framed protesters in Toronto. \\t\\r \\xa0  12 the Globe framed its coverage of protests under similar circumstances more than a decade later in Toronto. 2.6 Social movement theory  Studying how the media handles social movements and activism requires an understanding of what social movements actually are. A framework of protest helps us look at the diverse protest agenda at the G8-G20 and problematizes monolithic characterizations and generalizations of protesters by the media. Social movements can be understood by carving out four major themes or features. They are: 1.) collective behaviour: loose in organizational structure yet collective in a common pursuit to create change or resist; 2.) resource mobilization: a set of beliefs or activities united in a way to disrupt the reward/distribution system in a given society; 3.) political process: a social movement or organization attuned to seizing political agency; and 4.) new social movements: mobilizations that articulate the structural impediments to healthy communities and societies (Diani 2000). Understanding thematic characteristics of social movements can be complimented by exploring how individuals go from believing in something -- a cause, a movement -- to acting on behalf of those beliefs (Klandermans 1997). A movement must establish a collective action frame that includes common concerns, a sense of injustice, and action-oriented beliefs. In a study of Dutch anti-nuclear protesters, it was found that for a movement to successfully mobilize, it had to recruit through networking, articulate a target, sustain interest, and remove obstacles (Klandermans 22). Of course, mobilizing a network or group  13 of activists is more complicated than that. The disincentives to protest can be powerful. A disapproving family, or concerns over lost wages (if the movement plans a strike), or the threat of arrest can reduce willingness to participate. Another challenge in mobilizing a network is how the media portrays protesters and members. Thinking about protesters and social movement organizations in terms of motivations, strategies and anticipated outcomes can help eliminate protester essentialism and stereotypes. Often, the relationship between media and protesters seems to be a “dialogue of the deaf” (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 1993). Social movements traditionally rely on the press to disseminate their message while the reporter or news organization looks to protesters and movements to make news (115). Social movements need the mainstream media in order to gain recruits, achieve validation and increase the scope of the movement (116). In exchange, the reporters expect drama. It’s not a balanced reciprocity and social movements typically rely more on the mainstream media than vice versa. When the media does engage social movements or protest networks reporters find them complex and confusing (115). 2.7 The changing media landscape  Much of the literature since Gitlin (1980) has assessed the balance of power between social movements, protesters and the media. The power of the news media in recent years may be waning (Cottle 2008; Shirky 2008; Goldstein 2007; Castells 2007). SMOs and individual protesters or onlookers now have the ability to interact directly with the public via smart phones, and with blogs, Facebook, podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, bypassing traditional, commercial gatekeepers (Cottle 858). New opportunities within the realm of social movements and protest are arising for communication, story telling, mobilization and public interaction.  14 The Internet combined with new mobile devices and growing dissatisfaction with media gatekeepers can result in the public taking the responsibility for disseminating information into their own hands. Take, for instance, the case of the 2004 Ukrainian Orange Revolution (Goldstein 2007). During a presidential election citizens were growing frustrated with electoral fraud and with the Ukrainian media that were failing to provide critical and balanced election coverage due to government restrictions and censorship (2). Electoral activists turned to the Internet en masse as a way to bypass government restrictions on the press. Mobilized via social networking, personal websites and digital forums, protesters camped out in tent cities across the country throughout the election calling for electoral transparency and accountability. The true value of online communication in Ukraine came to light when Viktor Yanukovych (the 2004 presidential hopeful who was handpicked by the previous president) was attending a rally. As he passed onlookers in the street, a protester flung an egg that burst against Yanukovych’s chest. Feigning injury he retreated and his campaign team quickly announced via the press that he was hit and wounded by an attacker who threw a battery. Digital footage taken by a person attending the rally was soon uploaded onto the web. It proved otherwise. Presidential messaging was corrected not by the media, but by onlookers that captured the unfiltered truth8 (6). Protesters and onlookers in Toronto were able to cover the G8-G20 in a similar manner. The service that the Globe and Mail provides is a becoming less expensive, and more accessible to non-professionals (Shirky 2008). The Internet provides unlimited space for news, punditry, videos, images, forums, social networks and other publishing and  8 It’s worth noting that Yanukovych ended up losing the 2004 election, but eventually ascended to the presidency in 2010.  15 mobilization tools. The question of “why publish this?” has shifted to “why not publish this?” (60) We’re living in a networked society, and one that is arranged by mass self- communication (Castells 2007).  Before this information revolution, stories that didn’t make to, or through the media, didn’t make it to the public. The media gatekeepers may be losing their mandate. If a flung battery turns out to be an egg or if a Toronto police officer is badge- less and beating people indiscriminately, the public will see it regardless of whether an editor decides they ought to.   16 3    Chapter: Research Data  The study examines 62 Globe articles; 33 can be arranged as news stories, 14 as opinion/columns, 3 as Globe editorials, and 12 articles fell into a fourth general category in which I included features, analysis, profiles, and “Q and A-style” interviews9. 3.1 Sources  Of the 62 articles, nearly a third were framed by use of various official or authoritative sources including police leadership, members of the Integrated Security Unit, government officials, or members of business improvement associations and local business owners. In other words, the main thrust of the story was shaped or directed by the impressions, comments and opinions by authoritative stakeholders with a specific set of interests. Table 3.1 Official, authoritative, business perspective as primary source/total number of articles Percentage of articles with official/authoritative/business voice as primary source 20/62 32%  A story by Adrian Morrow published on June 27, the final day of summit, reported on the easing of security precautions by the Integrated Security Unit as the end of the summit approached, but cautioned that police forces retained the ability to extend their mandate into the following week if necessary. The first attributed quote went to Sergeant Tim Burrows, a  9Writing and Reporting the News (2008), a journalism instructional text, explains that news content usually includes facts, attribution, quotations, background and context, supplemented with accurate observations. Features would also include many or all of the above qualities but would also provide the writer more flexibility to exercise tone, colour, analysis and interpretation. Columns or editorials are opinions, prescriptions and impressions that are expressed by individual writers or the news organization’s editorial board. Taken together all portions of the newspaper contributes to overall discourse on a given subject.  17 spokesman for the ISU:  “Our security plan runs from the 18th to the 28th, so [the plan] will remain in place until midnight Monday evening,…“If [police are] required to stay longer, we’ll make that decision then.” Morrow continued in paraphrase: “He [Sergeant Burrows] said officers would remain on duty around the security perimeter, but if the situation was peaceful enough, they might start letting people into the secure perimeter early.” Morrow then provided Toronto City Councillor, Adam Vaughan, an opportunity to respond. “I think we’ll see the anxiety leave as the G20 does…my understanding is that some of the barricades are coming down tonight.” Morrow went on to report that by Sunday afternoon Mr. Vaughan was able to pass into the security zone “via Queens Quay without being stopped by police.” In next graph Morrow touched on the councillor’s hope that the city would return to normal during the following week. Morrow then turned to Janice Solomon, the director of the Entertainment District Business Improvement Area. Paraphrasing Solomon, Morrow wrote that local businesses would likely keep their own security precautions in place through Monday as they assessed whether it was safe to return to business as usual. Most editors expect to see tension in news reporting. It’s clear that Solomon’s contribution to the story is to assess the loss of business due to the G8-G20, but her assessment of blame is ambiguous, but seems to assign fault to the protesters. Now we have to wait out tonight and wait out tomorrow and see what happens, she [Ms. Solomon] said Sunday evening. Businesses shuttered during the protests would likely try to re-open Monday. Ms. Solomon said none of the businesses in her area were vandalized by protesters, but they lost enormous amounts of business. On Saturday, the most violent day of protests, she said only a handful of restaurants and clubs remained open to serve the few patrons in the area. (web)   18 No voices from residents, protesters, or accused vandals were included. This story about an expanded police mandate could be framed in many different ways. It could explore obstructed mobility for residents by police, or concerns by protesters that their rights to freely assemble and demonstrate could be curtailed into the following week due to a handful of vandals. In this instance the Globe allowed a police officer, a politician and a business advocate to shape the story according to their own particular interests and mandates. It follows then that the story’s news element is business-centric and appeals to the pre-protest status quo. A second example by Globe reporter Siri Agrell illustrates a similar disruption to business frame posited by official sources. This story (published on June 28) begins with a local resident expressing shock over the level of vandalism and violence from throughout the summit weekend. Agrell then turns to Laura Schaefer of the Queen Street West Business Improvement Area. “I think as a country, Canada\\'s so lucky to be a democracy and support peaceful protest. What we saw on Queen Street West yesterday was absolutely not peaceful...To see this destruction is beyond unfortunate.” At this point it would be useful to explore the notion of democratic rights and to hear from one of the many protesters who were on site exercising their freedom of speech in a “peaceful” manner. Agrell solely includes voices that construct a singular frame that emphasizes disruption, while also touching on the lack of effectiveness of the unnamed, monolithic protesters-as-vandals. Agrell continues: At least eight stores sustained damage during Saturday\\'s vandalism, and had begun filing insurance claims. The iconic Steve\\'s Music marquee was melted from the heat of a police car that had been torched in front of the store. But with protests still underway in other locations around the city, the singed outline of burnt police vehicles was the only residue of events on Queen Street. Ms. Schaefer said city cleaning crews had quickly picked up broken glass and garbage. (A10)  19 After including a short quote from Councillor Adam Vaughan, Agrell includes comments by another member of the Downtown Business Improvement Association who said that about 40 member-businesses had damaged windows, but it was too early too say how much the cost of repairs would be. The voices or sources within a story often set the parameters and initiate the context. The next two elements: marginalization of protesters and trivialization of protesters take a look specifically at the content and tone of the Globe’s frames. 3.2 Marginalization of protesters  Of the total 62 articles, 27 (43.5 per cent) were framed in ways that marginalized protesters, primarily through emphasizing violence and civic disruption10. Table 3.2 Marginalizing frames/total articles Percentage of marginalizing frames 27/62 43.5%  Some, like this July 1 column by Christie Blatchford, provided Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair the opportunity to frame protesters collectively as deviant, immoral and disruptive11. The event took place during the repatriation of Canadian soldier Sergeant Jimmy MacNeil (his body was being delivered to the coroner’s office upon its return to Canada from Afghanistan on July 1, at the same time that protesters had gathered at a nearby location to protest police actions during the summit.) Blatchford writes:  10 To discern if the Globe was marginalizing protesters I drew from Gitlin (1980) and Boykoff (2006). Taken together their studies provide criteria to judge whether media frames are marginalizing protesters and social movement organizations. Thus my test for marginalization considers emphasis of violence, disruption to civic order, and vandalism. 11 This example also illustrates how single sourcing of an authoritative voice can posit a presumptive, unchallenged frame.  20 At the time the cortège carrying Sgt. MacNeil\\'s body was arriving at the coroner\\'s office on Grosvenor Street, just two short blocks north of College Street, a group of about 30 demonstrators dressed in black moved out of a crowd of 2,000 who had massed in front of police headquarters on College. “The Black Bloc was here and they charged up the thing [laneway], as a matter of fact the repatriation was kind of interrupted,” Chief Blair said. (A10)  Without reporting on whether or not these protesters were in fact, Black Bloc, what that meant, whether they were aware of the repatriation proceedings, Blatchford permits Chief Blair to define the intentions of the protesters, and to frame their activities as morally reprehensible and disruptive. Curiously, the column was not about protesters, nor the repatriation. It was actually an assessment of a controversial law that sought to give police the power to search or apprehend people who breached a five-meter buffer around the security fence. The column continues: The Black Bloc group, he [Chief Blair] said, was “clearly evident in the centre” of that protest. “I\\'m looking down on it, my people are taking pictures of this thing. You can very clearly see the formation of this Black Bloc group in the centre.” (A10)  Blatchford continues: The backlash against the way police conducted themselves has been bizarre, with critics first accusing them of being too lenient, then too harsh, then of abusing their authority in arresting or detaining hundreds. Spectacular claims have emerged, among them lesbians alleging that they were segregated in the temporary detention centre and a female filmmaker from Montreal who says she was threatened with “gang rape” there. (A10)  Blatchford eventually gets Chief Blair to acknowledge concerns regarding the fence regulation, but Blatchford’s dominant frame portrays a busy head-cop struggling against an immoral, reckless and “bizarre” angry mob. Chief Blair is provided a platform to justify particular police actions -- security and order at any cost. In a departure from a typical news story, a “Q and A” between the Globe’s Kelly  21 Grant, and Chief Blair, ran on June 29. The primary frame of the conversation was assessing why the police couldn’t do more to prevent protester violence and destruction. Chief Blair’s statements adhere to this frame, and also carved a second frame -- one that equates protest and public assembly to criminal behaviour. We were trying to strike a balance, as we have to in law, between the lawful rights of citizens to protest … now unfortunately they [protesters using the Black Bloc tactic] turned their criminal intent away from the summit and they turned it on the people of Toronto. They rampaged on Queen and up Yonge…. It took time to get the resources up there. We\\'re looking very hard at ways in which we can respond to those types of tactics. (A1)  The conversation then turns to a scene that occurred at the intersection of Queen and Spadina. Grant asks Chief Blair how it came about that police contained so many people, and for so long. Chief Blair responds by seemingly arguing that once turbulence erupted among a select group of vandals, everyone on the street thereby forfeited their right to be present. Chief Blair continues: The police gave three very clear warnings, separated by time, asking people to disperse, asking people to leave the area, warning those curious to leave the area to allow us to deal effectively with those who had come to commit criminal acts. They declined. Some left, some didn\\'t. So we had to contain that. (A1)  Chief Blair continues, neglecting (and is not asked) to qualify how it was determined who was acting criminally or how it was illegal (“a breach of peace”) for people to gather in a public place regardless of whether they were “Black Bloc”: This was not a site where somebody casually walked up to catch a bus. It was clearly a large and dangerous demonstration. It was clearly a situation that we were asking people to avoid. We were asking people to disperse. They ignored that request. When they were warned that if they remained in the area they would be subject to the breach of the peace, I suppose for some of them their curiosity -- or perhaps their profession -- compelled them to stay. (A1)   22 Chief Blair reiterates the criminality frame: There\\'s no sanctuary from criminality. And what happened is after they rampaged along Queen and up Yonge Street, we watched them. We watched them as they went over to Queen\\'s Park. We watched them as they changed into other clothes, and we watched them as they hid in the crowd among the people that had gathered at Queen\\'s Park. We went in to apprehend them. (A1)  The excerpt is not included to question whether there were instances of criminality -- there certainly could have been. The point is to show how a frame can posit a singular impression. This particular one -- established by Toronto’s chief of police -- equates large-scale public assembly to criminality. The frame persists without a contestation of the premise that simply being present on the streets of Toronto is a breach of peace. Furthermore it treats protesters as a violent monolith, shedding no light on motivations or messages of other peaceful protesters present. At the heart of the issue of marginalizing coverage is the concept of intellectual shorthand and stereotyping (Lippmann 1922). In the top story from the Globe’s G8-G20 web hub titled “Standoff ends in downtown Toronto,” (reported by a team of four Globe journalists and sourced almost exclusively by members of the Integrated Security Unit) a group of detained protesters are described as: Looking “older than typical students, seated on the ground outside a U of T residence, with clear plastic bags of evidence or belongings around them. One man had a bushy grey beard. Others appeared to be university-aged women. Another arrested man, with a shaved head and green flipflops, sat on the sidewalk in handcuffs as police milled about. The suspects were being loaded on a bus, to be taken to the detention centre at Eastern Avenue.12 (Morrow et al web)  The descriptions continue:  12 My emphasis.  23 One bearded young man, being led to the bus in handcuffs, shouted: \"I\\'m innocent! I\\'m innocent!\" Another young man in a t-shirt and jeans appeared distraught and near tears as he was loaded into the bus. Most appeared to speak French as a first language, and police confirmed some were from Montreal. They said they might have been staying in U of T dorms for the summer. (web)  The descriptions that reporters use convey particular meaning to the reader. What does describing a person as “a bearded young man” symbolize? What does emphasizing the use of French imply? The use of protester essentialism can act as a “backdoor” way to construct a frame that places protesters firmly outside of the margins of normative public opinion (Gitlin 118). Nearly half of the articles in the Globe sample included references or frames that emphasized violence13, deviance and civic disruption. Many articles also relied on intellectual shorthand and stereotypes to construct meaning surrounding un-sourced protesters. In essence, the prominent narrative during the G8-G20 became a riot story, blocking a more comprehensive conversation about social justice and the expectations by citizens of their political leaders and diplomats. 3.3 Trivialization of protesters  About one-fifth of all the articles framed protesters in a way that made light of their activities, disparaged their effectiveness or focused on their appearance or dress in a condescending tone14 (Gitlin 1980; Boykoff 2006).  13 Civic disruption and vandalism in many cases were conflated with violence. This particular point, though not dealt with directly in this study, should provoke another separate discussion on how the media frames its discourse around protest and could ask the questions: when/why/does breaking a window constitute(s) an act of violence? 14 As with marginalizing frames, work by Gitlin (1980) and Boykoff (2006) provide the criteria by which articles were found to trivialize protesters or not.  24 Table 3.3  Trivializing frames/total articles Percentage of trivializing frames 13/62 20.9%  This June 29 column by Marcus Gee establishes a disruption frame, but then trivializes un-sourced protesters on the basis of their inability to fulfill their apparent objectives. Yes, a small band of so-called anarchists went on a brief rampage through the downtown, producing shocking scenes of mayhem. But the world did not come to an end. No one went to hospital, thank goodness. Broken windows were the worst of the property damage. When it was all over, the city picked itself up, dusted itself off and went on with its business. Sorry, Black Bloc, but we survived, disgusted by your scripted display of adolescent outrage but just fine in the end, thanks. (A14)  The following June 28 column by John Doyle is another example of trivialization based on protester descriptions and ineffectiveness. Interestingly, Doyle (an arts and culture columnist) casts two stones, one at protesters, but another at the mainstream media, which he aptly suggests is foolishly preoccupied with the spectacle of violence. Without even seeing the footage we could all picture it -- kids in black hoodies and bandanas throwing stones, breaking windows and, probably, setting a police car on fire. That\\'s precisely what it was, of course. See, the G20 is the Oscars of the protest-world. Tons of media attention, not much context. Photo-ops and fame. And television coverage of the G20 Summit and the protests in Toronto has been drearily predictable, and mostly as mindless as Oscars coverage. The protests -- representing nothing more than infantile, pay-attention-to-me-Mommy exhibitionism and destruction -- are photo- opportunities as much as the politicians\\' statements and handshakes, are photo-ops. Getting on television is pretty much the point of everything, and television loves live, violent action as it loves movie stars. (R1)  Doyle’s frustration with the media’s failure to provide thematic context is a noteworthy grievance. Despite his own concerns though he fails to disrupt his own marginalizing and trivializing frames: violence, disruption and disparagement of effectiveness, supplemented  25 with condescending tone. He also takes it one step further by suggesting a singular intention of protesters that “getting on television is pretty much the point of everything.” Another column by Marcus Gee, this one on June 25, reflects one of Boykoff’s (2006) primary findings during his study of commercial media coverage and framing of the anti- WTO protests in Seattle in 1999. In that study Boykoff found: Negative portrayals of movement diversity were seven times more common than positive representations. For instance…USA Today reported, “A bewildering spectrum of voices has converged on Seattle” in order to give trade “a black eye.” The authors later asserted, “Anti-WTO forces are united by a profound mistrust of globalization -- and almost nothing else. (220)  Boykoff’s “amalgam of grievances” frame was well represented in the Globe’s coverage, and most sharply in this instance when Marcus Gee disparages protesters for complaining about too many things at once. Protests at international gatherings tend to be eclectic events -- many groups, many causes -- but Toronto’s G20 protests may set some kind of record for the variety of complaints being voiced at one time. Even before the weekend summit gets under way, we have seen marches and demonstrations for gender justice, queer rights and disability rights; environmental and climate justice; and indigenous sovereignty. Monday’s day of protest was a mouthful, calling for “migrant justice and an end to war and occupation, income equity and community control over resources.” (web)  Gee continues with the trivializing frame and then draws in stereotypical portrayals of the voiceless protesters: Two young guys with long hair and marijuana-leaf kerchiefs wore T-shirts advertising Oshawa Cannabis Day. On the less festive side, a group of about a dozen men and women wore ninja black from head to toe, with hoods and masks to keep their identities private. Their shouted message was simple enough: “Fuck law and order.” It was all very colourful, but you have to wonder: with so many messages, does any one of them really stick? (web)   26 Despite his disparaging, condescending tone and his decision to emphasize marijuana activists as representative of the collective body of protesters and social movements, Gee asks a relevant question -- albeit one that remains unanswered -- do any of the issues really stick? 3.4 Dissenting frames  When looking at the Globe’s total coverage (62 articles) it’s clear that not all Globe coverage adhered to official frames that marginalized and/or trivialized protesters. In 15 per cent of the sample coverage, the Globe published unchallenged, dissenting frames including protester-friendly angles, explorations of excessive police force, coverage of curtailed civil rights and others. Table 3.4 Globe frames that challenged or disrupted official, authoritative frames/total articles Percentage of dissenting frames 9/62 14.5%  Consider the following excerpt from a first person essay written by Cinders McLeod, the Globe’s design editor. In it McLeod recalls his own background as an activist in Britain during the 1980s and his sense that the G8-G20 protests would provide a good opportunity to introduce his young children to protest and participatory democracy: I thought since the detention centre was local and far away from the G20 security zone, it would be a gentle introduction into the peaceful art of protest. I cared for the community, I cared for the people who were unjustly detained and I cared that my children cared too…There were young folk, folk my age, folk with dogs, folk with children on their shoulders, older folk and media…With no warning, there was a sudden penetration and retreat in the crowd. The police had moved in for a couple of arrests. I called Diarmid and Anya in closer…without warning, police officers stormed the peaceful crowd, swinging their sticks and throwing people to the ground. I saw  27 Anya being pushed by one of the group of police. I screamed out her name. They threw the young man next to her to the ground. Diarmid ran toward the skirmish just as a kind boy pulled Anya out of the policemen\\'s path. She looked so thin and vulnerable and 14 in her short shorts beside the black, violent swarm. The front line of protesters sat down again, hands held in the air in peace signs, chanting, ‘We are peaceful, how \\'bout you.’ (L8)  McLeod’s experience culminates as he flees with his children down a nearby alley. While making their escape, McLeod was hit in the back with a rubber bullet -- a burst, he speculates, from the gun of a police officer. McLeod’s account represents an independent perspective, speaking to the issue of excessive force against protesters, and the diminishment of free speech. Its major premise though is supported by much of the scholarship on the media’s pre-occupation with protest violence (regardless of the perpetrators) rather than investigating protest motivations and thematic grievances (Gitlin 1980; Boykoff 2006; Boyle et al 2006). While McLeod provides a captivating, albeit episodic, narrative about his family’s day among the protests, it still loses traction on the reasons for protesting in the first place and descends into yet another Toronto riot story anchored to violence. An overall assessment of the Globe’s coverage would not be complete without acknowledging a good example of introducing complexity, nuance and motivations regarding protesters or social movements, and one that is divorced from the monolithic violence frame. An essay by Annahid Dashtgard published in the Globe on June 25 exemplifies that. Dashtgard’s essay begins: “I am a protester. I believe in the power of mass groups of people gathering to stand up for an issue that would otherwise be invisible. I was there in Seattle in 1999 in the rise-up against the World Trade Organization, and in Quebec City for the protest against the Free Trade Area of the Americas in 2001.”  28 Dashtgard, according to her article, became interested in protesting following unsatisfying political party work in Edmonton. While working within the Canadian democratic system, she routinely fielded calls from “single mothers unable to make welfare, students facing bankruptcy with ever-increasing tuition rates, recent immigrants with nowhere else to turn” and felt she unable to help them in a meaningful way. “As a young woman wanting to make the world a better place, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of pain.” After meeting with a “seasoned union activist,” Dashtgard started arranging speakers, rallies and conferences to garner attention to various issues but quickly started asking “how much impact these mass protests were having on decisions being made?” Should she “just accept that inequity was the name of the global economic game and make peace with it?” There were enough people encouraging her to move beyond a “rebel” phase and accept the world for what it was. Yet she resisted. She recounts the positive and successful movements that she has been a part of in her life and she summarizes her perspective and her intentions thus: I am a Torontonian. I live in this city that is to be host to the G20 this weekend. And I am planning to protest…I will put my body on the line to march against this inequitable system where 20 nations make decisions affecting the whole world. Yet this time, instead of being supported in my right to protest, I find myself explaining why I am legitimate…Media coverage has mostly focused on disruption to businesses and traffic. Police have been harassing my friends already while they have been passing out flyers, riding bikes or just lying down in the park. My head can\\'t help but feel despair of ever reaching that world where decisions are truly democratic, where eradicating poverty is more important than furthering profit…Surrounded by fear and fences, hope and passion for an equitable and democratic world can yet be set free. (L6)      29  4    Chapter: Discussion  4.1 Findings  To return to the hypothesis of whether the Globe and Mail found itself at odds with the messaging of protesters and social movements during the G8-G20, to discern if this was the case four aspects were assessed: sources, marginalization tendencies, trivialization tendencies, and the publication of dissenting perspectives. Firstly, when looking at how the articles about the protests were assembled it was found that 32 per cent of the sample coverage was framed by an authoritative source. This finding illuminates one of Herb Gans’s (2003) findings: “Journalists respect their official sources, reporting what these sources tell them. They may be critical of what they are told and of the sources themselves, but the sources usually have the first say, thereby putting the others in a reactive and as such inferior position” (46). That inferior position does not necessarily occur because of intentional de-emphasis of alternative voices (such as government critics, protesters or social movement participants) by journalists, but because of well-shaped relationships and networks among and between official newsmakers and news organizations and their reporters. In this regard, the Globe and Mail is no different than other Canadian commercial news organizations. The structures of media institutions that journalists work within often shape the news as much as a reporter’s own values and perspectives (Gans 45; Chomsky 3; Tuchman 4). Trying to make tight deadlines and provide credible reporting while working within corporate profit- seeking institutions can lead to dependence on official sources to establish the frames of news (Gans 49).  30 Voices in the news typically come from within institutions, organizations and structures that have channels built into them that streamline access for journalists who are working within demanding “mass production” circumstances (Gans 49). Spokespeople from law enforcement, government, and business mark a news story as legitimate in the eyes of news editors. These relationships are reciprocal; when the mayor of Toronto, or someone of that stature makes a statement, it’s most likely to be included in the story, and in some instances that information will provide the basis for an entire uncontested frame (49). Reporting the perspectives, opinions and ideas of officials or institutional stakeholders is easier and cheaper than spending hours in the field cultivating sources with unfamiliar participants, especially in a situation like the G8-G20 when news is breaking continuously and the appetite for information is high. There is not a complete dearth of communication between reporters and protesters, but often, those relationships are laboured (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 1993; Rohlinger 2002). Social movements and protesters, like the ones present on Toronto’s streets in June, look to the mainstream media to get their message out. In turn, the media expect activists to produce compelling news. This usually comes in the form of making “trouble” (Gans 48). Turbulence makes for good TV and for attention-grabbing headlines, but the “dialogue of the deaf” between protesters and media usually fails to tease out nuanced objectives, motivations, and actual grievances directed at brokers of power by protesters (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 115). Reporters are often unfamiliar with protesters, and when the two parties come together to interact at a complicated and confusing venue like the G8-G20, there is often a breakdown in communication or none at all (115).  31 Social movements are diverse and complex. Some are fluid, loose, arrangements between individuals, and some are sophisticated networks with coherent public relations departments (Diani 2000; Rohlinger 2002; Cottle 2008). No matter the sort of organization, the movements and activists continue to depend on the mainstream media for mobilization, validation and scope enlargement (Gamson, Wolfsfeld 116). Many protesters lack the ability to communicate with the mainstream media and feel the pressures to attract attention by any means possible -- often relying on visually stimulating material favoured by mainstream media outlets (Gitlin 1980; Gamson, Wolfsfeld 1993; Boykoff 2006). When protesters do make into the core of a news story, it is no surprise that the confusing choreography between protesters and mainstream media lends itself to a frame dominated by violence and disruption -- it makes for simple, easy to report, captivating copy and footage.  The Globe and Mail’s use of official, authoritative sources (more than 30 per cent of the time) raises a question beyond the scope of this study: are reporters from the Globe establishing these dominant frames and then matching official sources to the narrative, or are official sources afforded the opportunity by the Globe to construct the frame of a story? The way the Globe sourced its coverage of the summit protests became a factor in its marginalization of protesters. The numbers show that in nearly half of the articles, protesters and the general protest narrative was pushed to the fringes and clouded by a monolithic riot and civic disruption frame. The primary tendencies within the Globe sample were; framing protesters as a violent and destructive bloc, emphasizing civic disruption as in opposition to a favoured business-as-usual perspective, failing to cover protesters as diverse, pluralistic entities, and by basing observations on stereotypes.  32 In the weeks and months following the summit weekend (beyond the date parameters of this study) a lot of news coverage was dedicated to exploring police brutality, civil rights and the ISU’s approach to security. Many stories have come out about journalists who were detained among the protesters and bystanders throughout the weekend. Yet as the news broke during the summit from the streets of Toronto, the narrative was markedly different. This could be due, in part, to the comfort that the media has in reporting what the police disseminate. Typically, the relationship between police and reporters is a formalized exchange and the policeman as a source is rarely marginalized. “Crime stories sell papers, and reporters rely almost exclusively on police reports and official accounts to relay events to the public. This relationship, in the case of large-scale civil unrest, compromises journalistic integrity” (Paletz, Entman 1981, 111). “When the power to define news is, in effect, turned over to the police, the media are serving to confirm the existing control mechanisms in society” (Gitlin 43). It’s predictable then that when police are afforded the foremost opportunity to tell their story about a major social justice challenge to the status quo, that narrative will undoubtedly emphasize violence. (Paletz, Entman 111). In Toronto, when Chief Blair spoke of “criminals,” and “violence” he was correct to think that his words could activate a  “cultural strumming15” that would make its way into headlines and stories and would help shape the overall G8-G20 narrative while the summit unfolded. Police rhetoric during the summit routinely conflated violence with vandalism and civic disruption (recall Chief Blair’s criminality frame, page 22). Much of that information was reiterated by official sources from within the political and business  15 By “cultural strumming” Entman is not suggesting that the media indoctrinates a passive public. Rather the waterfall-like discourse arrives to public from above and then mixes within the “pool” of public opinion but then gets “pumped” back up into institutions and organizations by way of its parts, its individuals.  33 community resulting in a “cascading activation” of language that may have resulted in the construction of the dominant violence frame (Entman 2003, 415). Reliance on posited stereotypes can reduce plurality and diversity among protesters down to a marginalized catch-all (Gitlin 1980). By reporting voiceless character descriptions like “the young bearded activist with torn jeans” or the “French speaking protesters” reporters paint the protesters and protests with a singular colour that maintains existing stereotypes about protesters and their intentions. It’s difficult to measure what these sorts of observations are meant to convey, yet focusing on age, language, facial hair, and dress can act to mark participants as either inside or outside normative hegemony. These characteristics may symbolize: “these people are young, un-kept, idealistic, and francophone (read: from elsewhere).” This frame can destabilize their messaging and it provides information to readers absent of context and meaning. Stereotypes and intellectual shorthand starve readers of a more comprehensive understanding about the issues that social movements and protesters are seeking to highlight during something as significant as a global political, economic and social summit. Yes, the protester may be young, they may be idealistic, but what they have to say still has meaning and is an important contribution to social order at the local, national and global levels. Out of the sample of articles, about one-fifth trivialized protesters and made light of protesters’ intentions, effectiveness and character. Predictably, most of these instances were found within the paper’s opinion columns where there is a greater mandate for colour and entertainment. When a reporter shares their impressions about social movements or protesters they often do so by contrasting what they see, against what they consider acceptable and legitimate (Gitlin 69).  34 This study did not find a tendency to use frivolous quotation marks, but it did find a reliance on superficial observations to create trivial, de-stabilizing frames. When Christie Blatchford comments (p.20) on “spectacular” and “bizarre” claims among detainees she’s enacting a frame that makes light of the participants’ testimonies. When Marcus Gee bases his impressions (p.25) of the G8-G20 protesters on a few guys with “marijuana-leaf kerchiefs” and people in “ninja suits,” he’s cheapening the overall meaning of why so many people were there doing what they felt was important and necessary. The next step then is to ask: where does this formulation of what is legitimate and what is normal come from? 4.2 Hegemony  The Globe and Mail newspaper is jointly owned by Woodbridge Company Ltd, the primary shareholder in Thomson Reuters, a publicly traded, international media giant, and BCE -- Canada’s largest telecommunications company also known as Bell16. Though it’s the typical business model for newspapers and media organizations to operate as for-profit, commercial enterprises, it is still worthwhile to think about how stories about protest and disruption to social, economic and political order get dealt with by a newspaper that is part of a hegemonic system that depends on political economic continuity. Social movement activism that seeks to disrupt pro-capitalist governance, and social, political and economic hegemony is at odds with many of the values of elite, commercial media (Gitlin 1980; Paletz, Entman 1981; Lee, Craig 1992; Chomsky 1997; Gans 2003). Protesters, by design, question that status quo and seek to disrupt it through collective action and mobilization (Klandermans 1997).  16 Information available at: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/10/c8647.html  35 It is too simple to think about why the Globe would handle protesters and social movements in such a way without thinking about the newspaper’s position within existing systems of social, political and economic power. The Globe and Mail is a collection of individuals, organizations and institutions that are all, without exception, part of intersecting networks that change, become motivated, evolve and adapt in fluid, reciprocal and unpredictable ways. There are particular institutional, commercial interests at stake in the news media, and many of those companies’ relationships and networks are formed on that basis (Chomsky 1997; Tuchman 1978). Relationships are rarely equal and as Chomsky pointedly puts it: “It’s not that reporters don’t have the freedom to do their job properly or independently, it’s that organizations don’t hire dissenters or they weed out individuals who don’t conform to the approved status quo” (4). When looking at the relationship between say, the Globe and Mail, its reporters, and any given reader of the daily iteration of the paper, the way that a story about protesters is framed will have an impact on how a reader relates to those protesters. 4.3 Media effects  What then are the effects of such coverage on public opinion? As just mentioned, theories that assume that the audience or readership passively swallows everything the media gives them are outdated and overly simplistic (Gitlin 1980; Gans 2003; Schudson 2003; Entman 2003; Carragee, Roefs 2004). Many scholars appear to be in agreement that the mainstream media interacts with society in a fluid, reciprocal fashion. Editors and reporters are part of a public. Schudson, in particular, finds that the mass media has little, in any, ability to tell the public how to think, though it can emphasize topics and amplify aspects of the public conversation. In other words, the mass media and its components like the Globe  36 and Mail can set the agenda of topics for Canadians, but it will not indoctrinate them (Schudson 29). Studies of media effects must explore the demand (what the public is interested in hearing) as much as the supply (what the mainstream media is interested is showing) (Gans 2003). The media consists of individuals; they’re members of communities and parts of dominant culture (71). The news can initiate topics, inform, legitimate, emphasize, and affirm previously held perspectives within mainstream culture, politics and society (71, 72). With that in mind it could be reasoned then that the Globe and Mail did not tell Canadians what to think about protesters at the G8-G20, but by establishing a dominant frame of “protest as civic disruption” it neglected to widen and contextualize the public discourse mandate regarding social movements and protests at the summit. The Globe’s dominant frame may have constricted the protest-conversation agenda. In 1980, Gitlin wrote that The New York Times set the standard for “pack journalism” (98). If the New York Times validated an event with its coverage, it wouldn’t take long for affiliates, the wire service, or other news outlets hungry for stories, to republish or cover the same story and with similar frames. We must ask: in 2011 does the Globe and Mail set that same standard? 4.4 The end of the information gatekeeper?  The way we are communicating is changing (Castells 2007, 239). Before the rise of the Internet as a tool for mass communication, if a story (or a story angle) didn’t make it into the media, it didn’t make it to the public agenda (241). New opportunities for networked, or “many-to-many” communication has shifted the balance of power in the dissemination of information. The role that information gatekeepers like the Globe play is becoming less  37 important; the power of those institutions is deteriorating. To what extent though is not yet known. What is clear is that information has become cheaper; journalism less professionalized (Shirky 58). Today’s media ecology provides new political opportunities for organizations and individuals to get their message out beyond the structures of the mass media and its agenda-setting function (Cottle 2008; Shirky 2008). In Toronto, anyone on the street with a smart phone could record images and footage, and broadcast immediately via Twitter. Bloggers and tweeters stimulated information while it bypassed the Globe and Mail. On June 27, police forces in Toronto converged on a group G8-G20 protesters and bystanders at the street corner of Queen and Spadina17. Over a short period, a peaceful, yet agitated group of people waited, penned on all sides by a wall of police. Tensions escalated when police broke the front line, seizing protesters, and pulling them away from confused family, friends and onlookers despite the seemingly peaceful nature of the situation. That footage wasn’t shot by news cameras or reporters (a version was eventually posted on the Globe’s website). It was captured by a participant, and uploaded on YouTube for the whole world to see. The footage is telling. It’s raw; it’s without police or government interpretation. It has no frame. It’s clear that people are relying less on media to determine what they ought to, and what they will see, read or hear (Castells 2007; Cottle 2008; Shirky 2008).     17 Footage of the protest can be viewed on YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aohGLp00MmU&playnext=1&list=PLCDDB203E9E1C E271&index=11.   38 5    Chapter: Final Thoughts  Healthy communities require active communication and exchange. In liberal democracies, our institutions are only sufficient to secure the idea of democracy (Dewey 1922, 144). Without public feedback, criticism and action democratic institutions will remain unchecked. The media has a role to facilitate that exchange. Let’s think back to Marcus Gee’s assertion that the foremost protest messages tended to circulate around a “fuck law and order” paradigm, an interesting statement but one that misses the point -- that it’s the Globe’s role within Canadian society to get beyond that simple, episodic narrative. The G8-G20 in Toronto was a complex situation with a variety of different events, players and situations. Nearly half of the Globe’s frames marginalized the messaging of protesters by clouding the social movement story with a darker, monolithic riot story. Preoccupied with violence and disruption, the Globe shares the responsibility in stimulating and creating that dominant frame. It set the protesters at the G8-G20 agenda as one preoccupied with violence and civic disruption. Apart from a few examples of dissenting accounts and explanations by protesters (see McLeod and Dashtgard p.26-28), The Globe did little to bypass official narratives of the protesters posited by government, police and business, and it failed to get beyond the riot story and explore protester’s themes, motivations and objectives in a thematic way. Presumably many protesters and social movement organizations arrived in Toronto hoping to share a more nuanced and coherent message with the public than the one that was delivered, and presumably too, much of the public found those issues worthy of attention. If the Globe, or any other elite, commercial news organization fails to report in a more robust, comprehensive way, the public will be quick to look to the growing list of alternative sources  39 for unfiltered information. This is not to say that covering turbulent protests thoughtfully and critically is easy. It’s a challenge to be sure, but if it’s not the role of a respected, national, commercial news organization like the Globe to use its resources to do it, then others may step in and fill the information gap. This thesis solely takes the current temperature of one elite, commercial media outlet’s coverage of one instance of social movement activism in a Canadian context. It acknowledges some of the foundational literature on frame and social movement theory and pulls it through a tract of Globe and Mail coverage of protesters during the G8-G20 in Toronto -- a worthy and timely case study for social justice activism and Canadian media attention. The summit provided an opportunity for the media to participate in conversations about global social justice and Canada’s role in an increasingly globalized world, but also provided an opportunity to test mainstream media coverage of a mega-protest event in Canadians’ back yard. Through discourse analysis, and quantified research, this research explored the Globe’s sources, marginalization of protesters, trivialization of protesters and affordance of dissenting frames. The finding that stands out among the rest is that in nearly half of the sample coverage the Globe marginalized protesters by treating them as a violent, disruptive monolith and contrasted their story against a dominant frame that prioritized business-as-usual. This research does not explore the Globe’s coverage of G8-G20 news that did not reference protesters specifically. It may be the case that the Globe dedicated a tract of copy to issues pertaining to social justice, globalization, and Canada’s role in international diplomacy. Those topics, though, did not turn up in articles pertaining to protest, so we can suspect that social movement activism and protest is not treated by the Globe and Mail as a  40 portal into conversations about global social inequality, as much as it considers it an avenue into a discussion about civic disruption. Research like this usually opens the door to more questions than it answers. There are two particular issues that arose here that deserve more attention in the future. First, the issue of reporting on protest violence. In the Canadian context (and exemplified by the Globe) vandalism and violence tend to get used interchangeably. Breaking windows or damaging property is regularly described as violence, and interpreted as such by the public. Yet as part of a large-scale social, economic, and political uprising throughout other parts of the world today, the discourse of “violence” is getting routinely subverted into a discourse of “resistance,” “revolution,” and “freedom.” Are there, or will there be instances in a Canadian context where breaking a window or damaging a car is not just justified, but necessary in order to draw attention to the need for social, political and economic change? Secondly, this paper criticizes the reporting of the Globe and Mail but does little to explore how covering protesters and social movements can be done better. What then, could best practises look like in a complex, turbulent situation like the G8-G20? How should reporters approach their story telling? If the predictable narrative told of protesters and protest events is a riot story, how can news organizations get beyond that?             41 Bibliography  Agrell, Siri. “Torontonians try to make sense of G20 vandalism.” The Globe and Mail 27 June 2010: A10.

It compares measured audience market share against expected average market share on a province-by-province basis, replicating a 2002 study authored by Robert Picard that pioneered this method and applied it to various European public service broadcasters (PSBs) (Picard 2002a). Picard found that most European PSBs exceed statistical expectations for their market share, and in most cases led their respective markets (ibid.). Research suggests that Canadians generally feel that the CBC\\'s use of the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars it receives each year is justified (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 2003, 190). Canadians\\' feelings in this regard, however, hinge largely on the use they make of the CBC – non-use value accounts for somewhere between 25% and none of their perceived value of the CBC (ibid.). Better understanding the market performance of the CBC (i.e., how much it is used compared to its competitors) further refines our knowledge of how it relates to the audience it serves. Picard\\'s approach makes market share data more meaningful by accounting for the number of competing media outlets in a given market to generate statistical expectations of average outlet performance (Picard 2002a). Applying it to the CBC will further our understanding of how it fares against its competition. CBC Radio\\'s national audience was roughly 3.8 million people between 2005 and 2007 (CBC Annual Report 2006-2007, 37, CBC Annual Report 2005-2006, 27), representing its largest audience share in eight years (StatsCan, 2008). That share varied from 9% to 12% in the last 10 years of data available from Statistics Canada (ibid.). While these detail the scope of CBC\\'s listenership, they do not communicate anything about how competition affects PSB market share – an important consideration, given the impact of increased competition on the CBC\\'s television operations (Eillis 1991, quoted in Hoskins and 1 McFayden 1992, 275). To date, research done on many aspects of the CBC and its audience appears underdeveloped (Eaman 1994, ix). Ien Ang offers a powerful warning against leaning too heavily on ratings in her book Desperately Seeking the Audience. Ratings view the audience from a perspective above or outside it, portraying the audience as an objectified group needing to be shaped, manipulated, or controlled (Ang 1991, 5). They are a way of “making the audience visible in such a way that it helps the institutions to increase their power to get their relationship with the audience under control” (ibid., 7). This applies, she argues, regardless of whether an audience is thought of as a collection of citizens or as a public in need of education, information, entertainment, and possible reform so they may better perform their democratic function (ibid.). Audiences are controllable, external objects (ibid., 5).  In practice, according to Ang, any attempts to reform an audience will fail because reform demands an understanding of audiences that goes beyond what ratings can provide (ibid., 103). The suggestion that ratings are not the only tool required to understand the performance of a PSB has traction, but that is not to say ratings are unnecessary. Ratings, while not the only tool needed to understand a PSB\\'s performance, can still be meaningful and useful for doing so. Broadcasting aiming to serve the public can only fulfil that goal if the public in question tunes in. Studying ratings is an important component of understanding public service broadcasting. This is confirmed by their appearance in PSB studies. For example, Lund and Berg\\'s 2009 study uses comparative analysis of television PSB ratings performance in Denmark, Sweden and Norway from 1987 to 2006 to discuss government policy\\'s relationship with market share (Lund and Berg, 2009). Nord and Ibarra\\'s work on the television PSBs of Spain and Sweden between 1995 and 2005 uses market share as a measure of a PSB\\'s performance 2 (Nord and Ibarra 2008, 11). PSBs also use ratings to justify themselves to the publics they serve (e.g., CBC Annual Report 2005-2006). This study\\'s main research question is, “how does the actual audience performance of the CBC on a province-by-province basis compare with statistical expectations of audience performance between 1999 and 2007?” Answering this question will further our understanding of CBC Radio\\'s performance in relation to private broadcasters – an important consideration to the extent that public service broadcasting aims at different ends than private broadcasting. As will be shown, such a difference exists and PSBs serve an important function in modern democratic life. The CBC is no exception to this.  Indeed, as the Committee on Canadian Heritage found in 2008, the CBC is Canada\\'s only national radio broadcaster delivering education, culture and entertainment from coast to coat in both English and French (Committee on Canadian Heritage 2008, quoted on insidethecbc.com 2008). Given CBC Radio\\'s long history and prestigious reputation, it seems likely that any comparison with its private competitors will reflect favourably on the Corporation. Concern about the continued viability of PSBs in Europe has garnered attention at least since the early 1980s. Garnham, writing in 1983, expressed fear that the BBC was in the process of slowly transforming into a de facto commercial station in the face of competition from the commercially-oriented network Independent Television (ITV)  (Garnham 1983, 23). In 1998, Tracey compared preserving PSB into the new millennium to “the preservation of primeval bugs in amber” (Tracey, 1998, 33). Lange argues that corporate convergence and technological innovation could undermine public service broadcasting across Europe (Lange 2006, 1). Picard describes PSBs in Europe as facing increased competition and market upheaval from the early 1980s to 2002 (Picard 2002a, 227). However, research on public service broadcasting in Canada has tended to focus on matters of broadcasting policy (e.g. Raboy 1990). This research will focus on the influence of competition on a PSB in Canada. 3 In 1972, Canadian broadcasting pioneer Graham Spry gave a speech in Ottawa in which he identified the ultimate aim of broadcasting in Canada as producing a strategy of identity (Spry 1975, 89)1. Spry advocated a specific remedy to the looming problem of cultural assimilation into the United States: the reformation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the increased circulation of its programs (ibid., 93-94). If control of communication can foster community, the best way for a community to ensure its continuity is to control its communication. This is best done through one of the primary organs of large- scale collective action, government. Therefore, Spry considered government-funded broadcasting as a viable tool for nation-states concerned with their cultural sovereignty (ibid., 93). Given Spry\\'s influential role in founding the Canadian Radio League and lobbying the federal government to create a national public broadcaster in the 1930s (Babe 2000, 40-41), his advocacy of CBC reform and promotion might not be surprising. Equating, on some level, the fate of a PSB with that of a democratic nation-state, however, is not a radical idea; scholarly examples are manifold. Ferguson argues that public service broadcasting and nationalist values are deeply entwined in English-speaking Canada (Ferguson 2006, 192). Splichal also contends that the ideal of public-service media sits at the heart of the ideas of publicness and democratic government (Splichal 2006, 17), while Garnham presents public service broadcasting as a necessary alternative to commercial broadcasting which, if unchallenged, will strip a nation-state of its strategic and cultural power (Garnham 1983, 27). Tracey goes so far as to regard the decline of public service broadcasting in Britain as a challenge to “the whole character of our lives, ... principles and values and moral systems” and, indeed, democracy itself (Tracey 1998, xvi). Raboy contends that “the fundamental question of democracy” lies at the heart of all the debates surrounding communication, culture, and public service broadcasting (Raboy 1990, 355). Though none of these thinkers 4 take a uniformly positive view of PSBs – Garnham, for example, critiques the British Broadcasting Corporation as too eager to serve the state and ruling elites at the expense of the working class (Garnham 1983, 25) – they all agree that PSBs can play a vital role in serving the interests of the citizens of a nation-state and in some fashion contribute to that state\\'s cohesion and continuity. This study is important because it will measure an under-studied aspect of the performance of a Crown corporation with a unique mandate and an annual budget that approached $2 billion in 2008-2009 (CBC Annual Report 2008-2009, 61). The measurement will be done in a fashion that makes it easier to avoid the common confusion around the importance of market shares and the causes of changes in those shares (Picard 2002a, 228). It also adds to what we know about how well CBC Radio fulfils its unique mandate to cultivate national identity in Canada (Broadcast Act 1991, 3(1)(m)). Meeting this goal may have been more difficult between 1999 and 2007 (the period examined in this study) than in previous years. As Picard points out in The Economics and Financing of Media Companies, media outlets must compete with other outlets in the same format (intramedia competition) and with outlets of all formats (intermedia competition) (Picard 2002b, 149-150). The Internet may have made each audience member into a potential competitor for the CBC: as Shirky writes in Here Comes Everybody, in the modern world everyone with access to the Internet is a potential media outlet (Shirky 2008, 55). Getting them to pay attention to a single given outlet is therefore more difficult than ever before. Measuring the CBC\\'s effectiveness in recent years is thus a matter of some interest. This is complicated by the status of multiculturalism in Canada. Modern media and transport technologies increasingly allow immigrants to feel themselves members of what Karim dubs trans-nations; diasporic communities that overlap traditional national borders (Karim, 2006, 272). This tendency can subvert mass communications systems, which 5 potentially reinforce belief in the political validity of a nation-state (ibid., 269). Canada, with a higher per capita immigration rate than any European nation excepting the Isle of Mann, Luxembourg and San Marino (CIA World Factbook, 2010) may be more susceptible to this phenomenon than European countries. Canada, as a former British colony, also has a long history of immigration. Examining the performance of PSB in Canada over the period of time examined in this study is thus important and interesting. 6 Chapter 2: Literature Review My work aims to better understand the condition of public service broadcasting in Canada, and is situated within the scholarly debates about public service broadcasting and competition between media outlets. As such, the literature review will comprise two sections. The first will address the role of public service broadcasting in Canada. The second will review the competitive landscape of radio broadcasters in Canada in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries and studies of that landscape. 2.1 Broadcasting and Public Service in Canada As the original public service broadcaster, the BBC operates under a royal charter which obliges it “to inform, to educate and to entertain; to report the proceedings of Parliament; to provide a political balance” (Crisell 2002, 28). This broadly characterizes the purpose of public service broadcasting since its birth, including in Canada: to inform citizens of the activities of their government, to build social capital in one way or another and to treat the audience as a group of citizens. Kees Brants argues that the ideal PSB makes available what “the public needs in order to participate fully as democratic citizens” in public life (Brants 2003, 8). Though funded by the state (and therefore the public), public service broadcasting is more than just broadcasting funded by the public (Eaman 1992, 59). As Barnett and Docherty write, public service broadcasting is more about commitment to principles than ownership (Barnett and Docherty 1991, 24). Barnett and Docherty also offer a useful theoretical framework for interpreting public service in broadcasting. Based on a report from the British Broadcasting Unit, they explicate eight criteria that an ideal PSB fulfils. The first is universal access to the broadcast, regardless of location (Barnett and Docherty 1991, 26-27). The second criteria is providing programming that appeals to the media preferences of the entire population (ibid., 27-28). The third criteria is universality of payment – that is, since the entire population can access 7 the PSB\\'s materials, the entire population ought to pay for it in some fashion, whether it be through license fee, government subsidy, or some other means (ibid., 29-30). Fourth, argue Barnett and Docherty, the ideal PSB is free from any sort of external interference, be it political or commercial, with its mandate or capacity to fulfil that mandate (ibid., 30-32). The fifth criteria for the ideal PSB is that it recognize its special mandate to provide coverage of national interests, events, and culture and thereby “foster a sense to national identity” (ibid., 32). The sixth criteria requires that a PSB be especially conscious of the interests and preferences of minorities, both ethnic and otherwise (ibid., 33-34). The seventh criteria contends that the ideal PSB must be allowed and encouraged to experiment with programming (ibid., 34-35). Finally, though the ideal PSB will compete with other broadcasters for excellence in programming, it should not, argue Barnett and Docherty, engage in an obsessive contest for the most viewers or listeners (ibid., 35-36). These criteria provide a lens through which we may examine the work of other scholars studying PSBs. For example, Christopher Hanretty\\'s method of analysing the de facto political independence of PSBs evaluates them on the basis of Barnett and Docherty\\'s fourth criteria (Hanretty 2010). The CBC ranks below the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), but above the PSBs of countries such as New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, France, and South Africa (ibid.). Irene Costera Meijer investigates potential tension between the first (universality of appeal) and seventh (competition for programming quality, not audience numbers) of Barnett and Docherty\\'s criteria (Costera Meijer 2005). She argues that quality and popularity should be weighed equally as goals for PSBs (ibid., 47). Christian Nissen  studies one dimension of the fifth of Barnett and Docherty\\'s criteria; that PSBs should foster a sense of national unity and identity. Using statistical data from the European Audiovisual Observatory, Nissen describes the programming profile of various television PSBs and commercial broadcasters in Europe (Nissen 2006, 78). He concludes that 8 European PSBs generally air more news and information-oriented programming than their private competitors, and presents this as evidence PSBs attempting to fulfil their broadcasting mandates (ibid., 78-79). This fifth criteria is perhaps the most important to consider for Raboy, a leading critic of the CBC. Raboy contends in his comprehensive accounting of public service broadcasting in Canada that for most of its life the CBC has fused the ideas of public and state interests (Raboy 1990, 8). These interests, Raboy claims, generally fall into one of three categories: preventing Canada\\'s conquest in whatever form by the United States, suppressingQuebec separatism, and protecting the market to allow commercial interests to flourish (ibid., 336). To achieve this, Raboy argues, the Canadian government routinely places financial and political pressure on the CBC, routes broadcasting through Ottawa and Toronto (ibid., 340), and, through the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), resists proposals to set up alternative public broadcasters (ibid., 340). This results in a public service broadcasting system that treats its audience as a mass rather than as a public (ibid.)  – that is, as a numerous, spread-out, anonymous collection of individuals with relatively little in common and no ability to organize or act, rather than as an active, organized body of citizens engaged in political discourse (McQuail 2000, 41-42). Raboy lays out five requirements for improving public service broadcasting in Canada and moving towards treating audiences like publics. They include expanding the levels of government that influence PSBs, defining the question of cultural sovereignty in a broader context, and increasing public participation in public broadcasting (Raboy 1990, 355-356). The public interest, he argues, means allowing the different and conflicting publics that make up Canadian society to coexist equally and peacefully (ibid., 356). Public service broadcasting, by extension, would be broadcasting that furthers this goal, and this is currently repressed in Canada through the primacy of cultural sovereignty in Canadian PSBs (ibid.). 9 Raboy\\'s critique of the CBC challenges the notion that it functions as a PSB in the true sense, and other scholars have criticized the CBC as an instrument of nationalism (e.g. Filion 1996, Ferguson 2007) or simply accepted that this is so (e.g. O\\'Neil 2006). While this study analyses the audience performance of the CBC and not the qualities of its programming or policies, it is still based on the assumption that understanding the leading PSB in Canada (i.e., the CBC) is important. It may well be the case that the CBC too often conflates the interests of the federal government with the interests of the public, but it remains the oldest national public broadcaster in Canada (CBC Annual Report 2006-2007, 17). Barring the creation of an entirely new government-funded national broadcaster, which seems unlikely given modern political attitudes toward funding the already-established one (e.g. ibid.), the CBC is the largest PSB in the country. Recent research from Finn, McFayden and Hoskins at the University of Alberta found that Canadians feel the CBC is worth the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars it receives each year (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 2003, 190). Therefore, it remains a unique part of the Canadian media landscape and an important one to study. Ferguson, surveying print media coverage of the 2005 CBC lockout, sees public service broadcasting in Canada as a stronghold of the democratic ideals of public participation and access (Ferguson 2007, 197). Programming produced and consumed by the public, Ferguson argues, would make public service broadcasting enrich Canadian society and public life, and make Canada more democratic (ibid.). However, she contends that the CBC\\'s behaviour makes it de facto a tool of nationalism, albeit a democratic and representational nationalism (ibid.). Certainly, nationalism is abundant in some of the CBC\\'s defence of itself (e.g., Basen 2003). Ferguson does not define the CBC solely as a means to defend national identity in Canada – rather, she argues that nationalism dominates other conventional PSB values like high journalistic standards and accessibility (ibid.). She ends 10 her study of the lockout by admonishing the CBC for its state-centric orientation and encouraging it to allow greater public participation in the future (ibid.). Prang lays out a similar state-centric view of the CBC\\'s function as Raboy. Government support for the creation of a national broadcaster (i.e., the CBC) grew out of concern for broadcasting\\'s potential to blur the boundaries of national identity (Prang 1965, 3). This blurring made real the possibilities of American cultural annexation (ibid.) and Quebecois separatism (ibid., 10). Prang describes the CBC as the national government\\'s answer to Graham Spry\\'s famous statement that “the question is the State of the United States” (Spry, quoted in Prang 1965, 28). If Prang is right and public service broadcasting is first and foremost used by policy makers as a tool of national unity designed to prevent the northward cultural march of the United States, the validity of Raboy\\'s critique seems given. Eaman, a scholar at the Carleton University School of Journalism and Communication, analyses the CBC from the perspective of audience research. Using archival sources from the CBC\\'s audience research department and interviews with CBC employees, he argues that response to audience preferences, as discerned through audience research, plays a vital role in public service broadcasting (Eaman 1994, ix). According to Eaman, the CBC generally fails to respond to audience preferences and tastes in a meaningful way in both radio and television (ibid., 226). He points out audience ratings in particular as misleading instruments in this regard, as they show simply what is being consumed, not what audience members want to consume or what they think of it; at their worst ratings are used to determine the staying power of content-production formulas in the market (ibid., 144). He proposes a new model of audience research for the CBC to embrace: public participation, wherein the Canadian public is allowed to set basic broadcasting priorities and goals which the CBC then strives to meet (ibid., 224-226). 11 Eaman holds ratings to be of low equality and moderate meaningfulness (ibid., 162) for PSBs because they don\\'t in-and-of themselves indicate any substantive audience interaction with the programming and they favour heavy users over light users (ibid., 145- 146). Accounting for competition\\'s influence on market share makes partial redress of these problems, since it weighs ratings against statistical expectations. That 4 in 10 people listen to a given radio station means less than the knowledge that 4 in 10 do so in a market where the average broadcaster is expected to garner 2 in 10. Since ratings compare media outlets of the same format, this can indicate more clearly that people may prefer Outlet A\\'s content over Outlet B\\'s – a meaningful distinction. Competition between media outlets is different than competition between most other businesses (Picard 2002b, 139). This review now turns to an overview of the scholarly literature on competition between radio outlets in Canada. 2.2 Radio Competition in Canada Media outlets do not compete with one another in the same way that other business do. As Picard states in The Economics and Financing of Media Companies, compared to beer producers, shoe retailers, detergent manufacturers or farmers, competition among media firms in the same format (e.g., newspapers)  is notably lower because of relatively limited choice of outlets (ibid., 139). Substitutability between different formats of media outlets is comparatively limited (e.g., a television station and a radio station substitute less well for each other than a pizza and a hamburger) (ibid., 139-140). This further lessens competition between them (ibid., 139). However, competition among media firms has increased globally in recent decades, and there is still high competition to hold market leader position (ibid.). Competition between media producers of the same format tends to be highest when the producers target the same 12 audiences in the same location (ibid., 151). Intramedia competition is generally stronger than intermedia competition (ibid., 150-152).  Competition is highest in markets with many firms and low product differentiation and barriers to entry (ibid., 149). Picard argues that the more power a single firm holds in a media market, the worse that market will operate (ibid., 141). Radio stations are not immune to this, but their competitive relationships can be distorted by government funding (Berry and Waldfogel 1999, 190). For example, Berry and Waldfogel, though regression modelling of market share with various sociological data, found that public funding of jazz and classical music stations in the United States crowded out private stations that would serve the same audiences (ibid., 210). They argue private stations would provision for jazz and classical music audiences in large markets in particular (ibid., 209), though they stop short of suggesting that public funding to stations of this kind in said markets should be reduced (ibid., 210). It is interesting to note that many studies of American radio find a healthy degree of competition between stations (e.g., Greve 1996, Compaine 1985). This is not the case for Canada, where concerns about media ownership monopolies have persisted since at least 1977 (Beatty, 1977). Beatty, surveying the history of media ownership in Canada, highlighted the tendency of any Canadian media market, including radio markets, to tend towards fewer and fewer competitors over time because of mergers and acquisitions (ibid., 13). Beatty cites a theoretical example put forward by Leibling of a newspaper market with multiple firms (Leibling, quoted in Beatty, 1977, 13.). It is tremendously lucrative, he argues, for any firm that can afford the expenditure to buy out all others (even if this means paying much more than market value for them), since this will allow for monopolistic leverage (ibid.) and exorbitant future profits. Beatty argues that Canada experiences increased concentration of ownership each successive year, and that this harms Canadian journalism and public life (Beatty 1977, 15). 13 For him, competition is necessary for the proper functioning of both  media markets and Canadian democracy (ibid.). Surveying the Canadian media landscape in 1977, he saw a severe competition deficit (ibid., 20).  However, he remains skeptical that unregulated private enterprise will produce the required level of competition, and he cites numerous failed policies attempting to promote competition and divergent media ownership (ibid., 11, 14, 17). More recent scholarship on telecommunications competition in Canada also describes a competition deficit. Globerman, Janisch and Stanbury, reviewing the decision-making of the CRTC, found that it operated to promote cultural nationalism and diminish protectionist fears of American cultural invasion (Globerman, Janisch and Stanbury 1996, 156-157). They argue that Decision 94-19, which dealt with long-distance telephone service, is representative of the protectionist stance of the CRTC and the influence that established broadcasting interests and cultural nationalists have as a lobby over the CRTC (ibid., 157). They contrast this with the situation in the United States, which is more open to competition (ibid.). The CRTC, they say, rejects basic economic advice for increasing the competition in an industry: “reduce barriers to entry to the greatest extent possible” (ibid.). According to George, convergence – the merger and acquisition of firms in the telecommunications industry to create fewer and fewer players in a given market – peaked in Canada in the 1990s (George 2010, 556). This happened because the federal government and the CRTC liberalized broadcasting and telecommunications laws to allow for greater concentration of ownership (ibid., 557). This process continues across print, radio and television to this day, he argues (ibid.). George cites the 2007 purchase of the CHUM network (including its 33 radio stations) by CTVglobemedia as a more recent example of this (ibid.). He also argues that conglomerates like Rogers and CTVglobemedia make it increasingly difficult for new telecommunications firms to enter Canadian markets (ibid., 14 561). George contends that the Quebec broadcast media landscape is the least competitive in the country (ibid).  This concentration of ownership is potentially troubling, according to George. Concentration of media ownership can inhibit public discourse and media pluralism, partly because information professionals (e.g. journalists) tend to have limited employment choices (ibid.). Some scholars place the height of convergence at a different time. Winseck argues that concentration of ownership in broadcast media may be more acute now than at any time in the last 15 years (Winseck 2010, 365), while Finn, McFayden and Hoskins hold that it peaked in the 80s (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 1994). They approach the question of increased competition from a strategic perspective, reasoning that greater competition, which they associate with increased market convergence, demands more market-driven thinking from producers of cultural content (ibid.). Smaller producers, they hold, are at a competitive disadvantage compared to large (typically American) producers (ibid.). In radio, this effect is known as double jeopardy (Ehrenberg, Goodhart and Barwise 1990). McDowell and Dick define the double jeopardy effect as the tendency of less popular competitors in a market to accrue less customer loyalty per capita, while, conversely, more popular competitors accrue more customer loyalty than average (McDowell and Dick 2005, 272). Through the use of Arbitron quarter-hour listening diaries, they found modest evidence of the double jeopardy effect in the 100 most lucrative radio markets in the United States in 2002, though their analysis ignored non-commercial stations (ibid., 281, 278). If Winseck is right and convergence of media ownership is greater than ever in Canada (Winseck 2010, 365), new radio stations could suffer more from double jeopardy in Canada. He identifies ten media conglomerates that he argues control the majority of broadcasting and news in Canada: Shaw, Quebecor, Bell, Canwest, Astral Media, Torstar, Rogers, CTVglobemedia, Cogeco and CBC (Winseck 2010, 366). Through a survey of 15 financial records, he highlights two periods of marked conglomerate growth, the first from 1996-2000 and the second from 2003-2007 (ibid., 377). Winseck also deploys several competition metrics to assess how concentrated ownership of the Canadian media landscape really is for different formats. Competition ratios suggest that radio is less concentrated than newspapers or TV, but that it experienced a marked increase in concentration from the mid- 90s to roughly 2002 (ibid., 378). Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) scores, produced by squaring a firm\\'s market share and then totalling all the squares to make a score between 100 (100 competitors with one percent market share) and 10,000 (one competitor with an absolute monopoly) suggest that radio ownership is slightly concentrated, though less so than television and newspapers (ibid., 379). Ultimately, he argues, this presents concerns for the health of media in Canada and therefore Canadian democracy (ibid., 388). McDowell and Dick also offer a conventional definition of audience share, which might be thought of as equivalent to market share for a broadcaster: they define audience share as the fraction of audience members tuned in to a given outlet or program divided by the total number of audience members (McDowell and Dick 2005, 272). But unaltered audience share is not as helpful as it could be in this regard, as it does not account for the degree of competition in a market. Addressing this problem with respect to CBC Radio\\'s audience share in a small way is the aim of this research. The methods employed to do so will be discussed in the following section. 16 Chapter 3: Methodology 3.1 Research Approach This study is quantitative and examines the audience share of CBC Radio on a province-by-province basis across Canada against statistical expectations of average radio station performance, using a technique pioneered by Robert Picard in 2002. While qualitative methods like content analysis and in-depth interviews are appropriate for many aspects of mass media study, they are less useful for the objective of my research. Contributing towards a more accurate understanding of CBC Radio\\'s market share across Canada demands the macroscopic perspective and precise language that numerical data and quantitative research provides. This study adopts two of the goals of audience research described by McQuail: assessing media performance and fulfilling obligations to serve a given audience (McQuail 2004, 365). Quantitative methods have a long history in communications research, where they contribute to the eventual formation of theory and causal explanations of the role of media in society (Gunter 2002, 209). Though proposing causal connections is beyond the scope of this study, it will still engage in their foundational enterprise: hypothesis proposal and testing (ibid.). This testing is done through statistical analysis of data acquired Statistics Canada, the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement (BBM), and the Canadian Communications Foundation. 3.2 Research Question An overview of the scholarly literature studying public-service broadcasting and audience performance has informed the research question this study seeks to answer: How 17 does CBC Radio\\'s measured audience performance compare with statistical expectations across Canada on a province-by-province basis from 1999-2007? 3.3 Picard\\'s Approach To Audience Performance This study\\'s methodology is largely based on a technique first published by Robert Picard in 2002. Analyzing the audience performance of a variety of European television PSBs in the year 2000, Picard generated a measurement of a given PSB as follows: CMS – EAAS = Channel Performance CMS stands for channel market share and EAAS stands for expected average market share (Picard 2002a, 231). For the purposes of this study, CMS will translate to station market share, or SMS. Based on the number of television channels in a given media market, EAAS represents statistical expectations of market share percentage. Picard calculated each EAAS value by dividing the number of channels in a market into 100 (ibid.). The equation produces a numerical score that represents a station\\'s performance weighted against expectations of an average broadcaster in that station\\'s market called the channel performance, or CP. A positive CP score represents performance above expectations while a negative score represents performance below expectations. Picard\\'s technique is useful because it allows one to make more accurate comparisons of broadcaster performance across time and space, which can change a station\\'s number of competitors and, therefore its EAAS value. For the purposes of this study, CP will be changed to station performance, or SP. To adapt Picard\\'s method for this study, some tweaks were necessary. First, the available market share data relates to CBC Radio\\'s performance at a provincial level, and multiple CBC stations exist in every province, often in the same market. To compensate, the 18 EAAS for a station in a given province and year was multiplied by the number of CBC stations in that province and year to produce an EAAS value for every CBC station in the province at the time. This change assumes a high degree of intra-CBC competition, producing demanding aggregate EAAS values for CBC Radio in each province. In his study, Picard takes a different approach and treats multiple channels operated by a PSB in a given market as one channel for the purposes of assessing PSB performance (Picard 2002, 231). This better reflects the fact that PSBs design different channels or stations in the same market to appeal to different segments of an audience. In the case of CBC Radio, we might think of Radio One and Radio Two, or of Premiére Chaîne and Espace Musique as examples of this strategy. Clearly, English-language news and general interest programming (i.e., Radio One) and French-language music (i.e., Espace Musique) target different audiences and thus avoid competing with each other to the same extent that two radio stations of very similar type would. Collapsing all of a PSB\\'s outlets in a given market into one channel better reflects this. Yet some degree of competition exists between all outlets in a given market. One can, after all, only listen to one radio station at a time. To compensate for this, the data analysis was performed with both the more-competition and less-competition approaches and the results will be presented in tandem. The SP scores for the More Competition Model (MCM) are calculated as follows: Total CBC Market Share – (EAAS x Number of CBC Stations in Market) = SP 19 These scores are premised on expectations of at least average market-share performance from each CBC station in a market – a demanding assumption that produces lower SP scores than the Less Competition Model (LCM). LCM scores are calculated as follows: Total CBC Market Share – EAAS = SP This equation treats all CBC Radio stations in a market as one outlet. In other words, average market performance in the LCM (i.e., SP = 0) represents equivalency between a market\\'s EAAS value for one station and the combined market share of all CBC stations in that market. LCM scores are higher than MCM scores, and the actual performance of CBC Radio likely lies somewhere in between. Without some measure of competition between CBC Radio stations in a given market, the range of SP scores unfortunately cannot be resolved further. However, the LCM and MCM scores combined still form a useful metric, presenting, respectively, a best- and worst-case scenario for CBC Radio\\'s performance. 3.4 Hypothesis Given government\\'s resistance to establishing non-CBC PSBs in Canada (Raboy 1990, 340) and the hundreds of millions of dollars the CBC receives each year in government funding (Finn, McFayden and Hoskins 2003, 177), I hypothesize that CBC Radio performs above expectations in general, producing a positive SP score in each province and year examined in this study.  3.5 Data Collection The majority of the data in this study comes from a radio listening databank released by Statistics Canada on September 18, 2008 (Statistics Canada 2008). The data set contains 20 market share information for all CBC stations in all 10 Canadian provinces from 1999-2007. This is the most recent period of data released through Statistics Canada. The data were collected by BBM in the following fashion: the ten provinces of Canada were divided into 400 non-overlapping cells whose boundaries generally follow borders previously defined by Statistics Canada, such as counties or census agglomerations (ibid.). BBM then generated the sample size for each cell required to return statistically significant data from the survey based on population estimates (ibid.). Each cell\\'s previous response rate to past surveys determined the number of diary packages needed to achieve the required sample size of each cell (ibid.). Using computerized telephone listings and manually chosen telephone directories, BBM then compiled a listings database from which a stratified sample was taken. Then BBM\\'s Enumeration division used computer-assisted telephone interviewing to recruit sampled households to participate in the survey (ibid.). 40.2% of the sampled households agreed to participate. These households were mailed listening diaries for each household member 12 years of age or older (ibid.). Survey participants used these diaries to document their radio listening habits over a designated survey week in quarter-hour intervals (ibid.). The survey weeks used were always in the fall months (ibid.). Once completed, the diaries were mailed back to BBM, where they were sorted, screened and amalgamated into the results eventually published by StatsCan. This sample frame excludes some Canadians from the sample population. Excluded groups include residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Indian Reserves, institutions such as prisons and hospitals, households where no member speaks English or French, and individuals without telephone service (ibid.). Since BBM is Canada\\'s only national radio ratings measurement firm, these limitations must be accepted in order to continue the present study. 21 To determine the number of radio stations in each province for each year, I conducted a comprehensive tally through the Canadian Communication Foundation\\'s directory of station listings. The Foundation, a registered charitable organization established by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters in 1967, maintains an authoritative directory of Canadian radio stations, including CBC stations, from the advent of broadcasting in Canada until the present day. I counted the stations in each province, accounting for closures and openings, for each year from 1999-2007 to generate the EAAS values used in this study. The directory can be viewed through www.broadcasting-history.ca. The statistical analysis and graphing in this study were done with a combination of OpenOffice and R. 22 Chapter 4: Findings 4.1 Canada The utility of Picard\\'s approach to understanding the performance of CBC Radio is illustrated by comparing the following two graphs. Figure 4.1 is a histogram of CBC Radio\\'s national audience share over the time period under study. The graph\\'s mean is 10.78%, with a standard distribution of .97, a minimum of 9%, in 2005, and a maximum of 12%, in 2007. A  graph like this is less meaningful than one that compares actual performance against statistical expectations of performance. Accounting for the number of radio stations in all ten 23 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 CBC Radio National Market Share Year M ar ke t S ha re  (% ) Figure 4.1  4 provinces makes possible the generation of Figure 4.2, which depicts a very different picture of CBC Radio\\'s national performance. The MCM scores, represented by the lower line, have a standard deviation of 1.50, a minimum of -1.35 (1999) and a maximum of 3.41 (2007). Overall, CBC Radio goes from performing below statistical expectations in this model to performing above them during the period under examination. However, the progression is not uniform, with the notable exception of a reversal in 2005, when the national SP score drops to -0.86. The SP scores have a mean of 0.61, suggesting that overall CBC Radio performs slightly above statistical expectations during the period being studied. The LCM scores show similar trends, peaking in 2007 with a score of 12.29 and bottoming out at 8.68 in 2005. The LCM scores have a standard deviation of 1.04 and a mean 24 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 National Performance of CBC Radio Year S P S co re Figure  4.2 4 of 10.6, suggesting performance above expectations. When looking at the SP scores for the entire country, the LCM is likely more meaningful than the MCM. Radio stations in other provinces do not compete with each other to the same extent as radio stations within the same province, so a model that discounts the effects of competition is likely more accurate than one that incorporates it like the MCM. There were 75 CBC stations across the provinces in 1999 and 79 in 2007. 4.2 Alberta As shown in Figure 4.3, CBC Radio\\'s performance in Alberta differs from the national picture in several notable ways. 25 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 CBC Radio Performance in Alberta Year S P S co re Figure  4.34 The MCM SP scores in the figure are all positive except for 2005. The scores also generally decline until 2006, which has the second-highest MCM SP score, 2.08, of any MCM score on the chart. The scores are have lower spread than the national SP scores for CBC Radio, with a standard deviation of 0.88, a minimum of -0.17 (in 2005) and a maximum of 2.39 (in 2007). Though CBC Radio in Alberta produced positive SP scores over a period of negative SP scores for CBC Radio as a whole (1999 and 2000),  Alberta\\'s mean MCM SP score of 1.16 suggests that CBC Radio there performs at least slightly above statistical expectations for the period under study. The LCM scores, with a mean of 6.87 and a standard deviation of 0.65, suggest performance above expectations. They also move differently than the MCM scores, peaking in 2000 at 7.38 and declining slightly from 2006 (7.35) to 2007 (7.07). The minimum score of 5.39 is still earned in 2005, however. There were 5 CBC Radio stations in Alberta from 1999 until 2001, and 6 thereafter. 4.3 British Columbia Figure 4.4 shows that the SP scores of CBC Radio in BC are significantly higher than national averages from the period under study. CBC Radio in BC produces such high MCM SP scores that its smallest score, 5.3 in 2005, is 1.55 times that of the highest of the national average scores, 3.41 in 2007. Figure 4.4 has relatively low spread, with a standard distribution of 1.93 under the MCM and 1.83 under the LCM. The maximum SP score under both models occurs in 2006 (11.04 for the MCM and 16.78 for the LCM). The mean MCM SP score is 8.71; over 14 times that of the equivalent national 0.61. Comparing LCM makes British Columbia\\'s scores look slightly less impressive, though the mean of 14.74 is still higher than the national LCM SP mean of 10.6. 26 It is interesting to note that, though CBC Radio in BC still maintains comparatively high SP scores of 5.3 (MCM) and 11.34 (LCM) in the year 2005, that particular year still produces the lowest score of any in the present study. Also, unlike the national mean SP scores, which peak in 2007, CBC Radio in BC peaks in 2006 in both LCM and MCM scores. Overall, this approach suggests that CBC Radio in BC exceeds statistical expectations by a considerable margin. There were 7 CBC Radio stations in BC from 1999 to 2001, and 8 thereafter. 4.4 Manitoba Figure 4.5 demonstrates that CBC Radio in Manitoba may have performed below statistical expectations in the period under study. 27 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 CBC Radio Performance in British Columbia Year S P S co re  Figure  4.44 Manitoba\\'s MCM SP scores have a minimum of -4.2, for 2005, and a maximum of -0.03, seen in both 2006 and 2007. The scores have a standard distribution of 1.3 and a mean value of -1.70, which is below the national MCM mean of 0.61. It is interesting to note that CBC Radio in Manitoba garnered its lowest MCM SP score in 2005, while most other provinces (as well as the national averages) garner their lowest scores in 1999. Manitoba does match the general trend of strong performance in 2006 and 2007, however, with its highest scores earned in those years. The LCM SP scores generally follow the same patterns, though of course at higher values. The scores have a mean of 7.93 and a standard deviation of 1.24.

The lowest value of 5.32 occurs in 2005, and scores generally increase in the period under examination, growing from 7.27 in 1999 to the maximum scores in 2006 and 2007. There were 4 CBC Radio stations in Manitoba in 1999 and 2000, and 5 from 2001 until 2007. 4.5 New Brunswick Figure 4.6 shows the SP scores of CBC Radio in New Brunswick from 1999 to 2007. Like the national MCM SP scores, the lowest score in New Brunswick happens in 1999. However, New Brunswick\\'s score of -3.98 in that year is lower than the national score (- 29 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Performance in New Brunswick Year S P S co re Figure  4.64 1.35). The following year scores considerably better (though still below expectations) with a score of -1.15. Indeed, yearly MCM SP scores increase until 2002, where they reach 1.75. CBC Radio in New Brunswick generates positive MCM SP scores in 2004, 2006 and 2007, but, like the national scores, a negative score is observed in 2005: -1.84, in this case, again lower than the national score in the same year (-0.86). This changing from positive to negative MCM SP scores is frequent compared with the other provinces and the MCM SP scores of CBC Radio across the whole of Canada. The MCM SP scores have a maximum of 2.07 (2004), a minimum of -3.98 (1999), and a standard deviation of 2.09. Their mean is 0.05. The LCM SP scores do not show the same growth as the MCM SP scores between 1999 and 2002, but they do generally indicate performance above expectations, with a mean of 11.81. The scores have a minimum of 8.36, earned in 2005 like most minimum SP scores in this study. The maximum value of 13.56 comes in 2000. The LCM SP scores have a standard distribution of 1.62. Overall, the MCM and LCM SP scores suggest that CBC Radio in New Brunswick performance generally exceeded expectations between 1999 and 2007. There were six CBC Radio stations in New Brunswick during the period under study. 4.6 Newfoundland and Labrador Figure 4.7 shows that CBC Radio Newfoundland and Labrador garnered negative MCM SP scores for the whole period examined in the present study. The scores follow the general trend of low values in 1999 and 2005, with scores of -13.24 and -17.83 in those respective years. It is interesting to note that, unlike the national scores, those of CBC Radio in Newfoundland and Labrador show relatively little increase between 1999 and 2007, starting at -13.24 and finishing at -11.73. This represents a change in SP score of 1.51, which 30 is 31.6 percent of the difference in the national scores of the same period (CBC Radio\\'s national MCM SP score increases by 4.76 between 1999 and 2007). Overall, the scores have a minimum of -17.83 (in 2005), a maximum -10.24 (in 2001), a standard distribution of 2.3. The mean MCM SP score of -12.54 suggests that CBC Radio in Newfoundland and Labrador performs below statistical expectations in the period studied. The LCM SP scores move in a similar pattern, though at higher values. They have a mean of 7.86, a maximum of 10.45  (2001), a minimum of 2.17 (2005), and a standard distribution of 2.55. This suggests performance above expectations, albeit by a smaller margin than most other provinces. 31 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Performance in Newfoundland and Labrador Year S P S co re Figure  4.7 4 Since the LCM and MCM scores together describe the possible range of CBC Radio\\'s performance against statistical expectations, the scores in Figure 4.7 present the possibility that CBC Radio is performing above or below expectations in Newfoundland and Labrador. The true performance likely lies somewhere between the two bounds, suggesting performance marginally above or below expectations. There were seven CBC Radio stations in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1999 and 2007. 4.7 Nova Scotia As Figure 4.8 shows, CBC Radio in Nova Scotia garnered positive MCM SP scores between 1999 and 2007 with the exception of 2005. The scores have a minimum of -1.61 (in 2005), a maximum of 3.74 (in 2006), and a standard distribution of 1.67. The scores also decrease relatively drastically from 2006 to 2007, going from 3.74 to 1.28 – not much higher than the 1999 SP score of 1.18. This is atypical compared to other MCM SP scores at both the provincial and especially national level, where it grows from 2.24 to 3.41 in the same period. Overall, the mean MCM score of 1.69 suggests that CBC Radio in Nova Scotia performs above expectations for the period examined in the present study. Since this score represents a worst-case scenario, it seems likely that CBC Radio in Nova Scotia performs above expectations on average. The LCM SP scores, unsurprisingly, follow a similar pattern with higher values. The LCM SP standard distribution is 1.92, while the maximum score of 10.45 occurs in 2001. The minimum LCM SP score of 9.2 occurs in the same year as the minimum MCM score, 2005. The LCM SP mean of 13.26 suggests performance above expectations. There were five CBC Radio stations in Nova Scotia between 1999 and 2007. 32 4.8 Ontario As Figure 4.9 shows, Ontario garnered positive MCM SP scores in every year examined in the present study. The MCM SP scores also generally increase, with the second lowest score of 1.42 occurring in 1999 and the maximum score of 5.22 coming in 2007. This latter score is 3.68 times the size of the former. The minimum score, 0.35, was garnered in 2005. The scores have a standard distribution of 1.39 and a mean of 2.79. These scores suggest that CBC Radio in Ontario performed above statistical expectations between 1999 and 2007. 33 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -5 0 5 10 15 20 CBC Radio Performance in Nova Scotia Year S P S co re Figure  4.84 The LCM SP scores suggest performance above expectations by a greater margin. The maximum score of 10.43 occurs in 2007, the minimum of 6.20 in 2005. The scores have a standard distribution of 1.17 and a mean of 8.85. The positive means of both the LCM and MCM SP scores suggests that CBC Radio in Ontario performed above on average expectations during the period under study. There were 15 CBC Radio stations in Ontario during the period examined. 4.9 Prince Edward Island As Figure 4.10 shows, CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island garnered negative MCM SP scores in every year examined in this study. The minimum score is -23.73, coming in 34 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 CBC Radio Performance in Ontario Year S P S co re Figure  4.94 2005, and the maximum is -8.23, garnered in 2006 – interestingly, one year after the minimum score. The SP scores also increase overall by 5.06, from -16.23 in 1999 to -11.17 in 2007. CBC Radio\\'s SP scores in Prince Edward Island have a standard distribution of 4.92, the largest of any of the provinces. The mean MCM SP score of -15.09 is the lowest of any province. The mean LCM SP score of 1.04 is also the lowest of any province. Prince Edward Island\\'s LCM SP scores also have a comparatively large spread, with a standard distribution of 4.91. The lowest score of -7.07 occurs in 2005, while the maximum score of 8.43 in 2000. Negative scores are earned in 2001, 2005 and 2006. Since LCM SP scores represent a best-case scenario of performance, these scores suggest that CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island performed below expectations in 2001, 35 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -25 -22.5 -20 -17.5 -15 -12.5 -10 -7.5 -5 -2.5 0 2.5 5 7.5 10 CBC Radio Performance in Prince Edward Island Year S P  S co re Figure  4.104 2005 and 2006, and may have performed below expectations in other years as well (e.g., 1999 has an LCM SP score of 0.43). There were 2 CBC Radio stations in Prince Edward Island between 1999 and 2007. 4.10 Quebec Figure 4.11 demonstrates that CBC Radio\\'s MCM SP scores in Quebec go from negative to positive the time period studied. The minimum score, -3.19, occurs in 1999, while the maximum score of 4.50 occurs in 2007. With the exception of 2004, when the score remained the same as the previous year at 0.49, MCM SP scores increase every year – even in 2005, when the MC SP score of every other province\\'s CBC Radio stations decreased. The scores have a standard distribution of 2.57. The LCM SP scores show the now-familiar similar patterns at higher values. The scores have a mean of 9.83, a standard distribution of 2.29, a maximum of 13.88 and a minimum of 6.88.  The maximum and minimum scores occur in the same years as the equivalent MCM SP scores, 2007 and 1999, respectively. As will be discussed later in this study, the SP scores of CBC Radio in Quebec in 2005 is somewhat unusual. The scores of CBC Radio in every other province went down in that year. One explanation that immediately suggests itself is that the higher number of French-language (Radio-Canada) stations in Quebec compared with the rest of Canada might have played a role. It may well be that French-speaking audiences behave differently than English-speaking ones in this context. Future audience research might investigate the possibility. Another explanation is that English-speaking programming changed in some fashion detrimental to maintaining market-share. A carefully-done content analysis could test such a hypothesis. Another possible cause might involve the labour dispute of 2005, which saw most CBC employees outside of Quebec cease work for seven weeks and one day 36 (Ferguson 2007, 182). It is beyond the scope of the present study to investigate the resiliency of CBC Radio in Quebec in 2005, but it certainly warrants future research. It is interesting to note that CBC Radio in Quebec\\'s mean MCM SP score is nonetheless still negative, at -0.26. This suggests that overall, CBC Radio in Quebec may have performed below statistical expectations during some of the years examined by the present study. There were 15 CBC Radio stations in Quebec in 1999 and 2000, and 16 from 2001 onwards. 37 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Performance In Quebec Year S P S co re Figure  4.114 4.11 Saskatchewan Figure 4.12 illustrates that CBC Radio generally garnered positive MCM SP scores between 1999 and 2007.

The LCM SP scores have a mean of of 8.32 and a standard distribution of 1.24.

The findings suggest that CBC Radio performance against statistical expectations varies significantly between provinces and over time. The national mean MCM SP score of 0.61 suggests that CBC Radio generally performs at least slightly above expectations, while the LCM mean of 10.6 suggests it does so by a significantly wider margin. However, this macroscopic view of MCM scores resolves to a somewhat different outlook when one moves past the national perspective to examine the provinces, as Figure 5.1 illustrates. 40 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 CBC Radio Provincial MCM Scores Year M C M  S P Sc or es Figure  5.14 The two lines along the bottom are Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, while the line along the top is British Columbia. The seven other provinces cluster in the middle, generally between -5 and 5. Between the seven middle provinces, the range between the MCM scores is biggest in 2001, at 6.08, and smallest in 2006, at 3.99. Their collective mean increases year-over-year from 1999 to 2007, with the exception of 2005, where it dips from its preceding score of 1.26 to -1.05. Ontario has the highest score in every year except 2002, when Nova Scotia leads with 3.55, and 2005, when Quebec leads with 1.14. 41 The MCM SP scores, examined in isolation, suggest that CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland perform markedly worse than in the rest of the country, while its performance in British Columbia exceeds expectations by a considerable margin. The LCM SP scores viewed together produce a different picture, as illustrated by Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2 has the same legend as Figure 5.1 – Prince Edward Island\\'s scores form the green line along the bottom, while British Columbia\\'s form the orange line along the top. It is interesting to compare the position of Nova Scotia\\'s scores, represented by the navy line, in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2. While its MCM SP scores place it with those of most other provinces, its LCM SP scores are the highest in the period studied in 1999 (13.68), 2000 (14.68) and 2002 (15.67). Newfoundland\\'s scores, represented by the yellow line, jump into the middle of the pack. Though Prince Edward Island\\'s scores remain markedly more 42 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 CBC Radio Provincial LCM Scores Year S P S co re s Figure  5.24 negative than the other provinces (excepting 2004, when it peaks at 8.43), the LCM SP scores overall have a smaller spread than MCM SP scores, as indicated by their smaller average range (10.86 to 14.12). Given the differences between the two sets of scores, it is useful to examine the picture produced by their means. Figure 5.3 does this. Figure 5.3 presents a more coherent picture of CBC Radio\\'s performance, though a less reliable one. It represents the mean of the MCM and LCM SP scores. British Columbia\\'s scores remain the highest while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland\\'s scores are still the lowest, but by smaller margins than in the MCM graphs. The combined scores have a mean 43 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 CBC Radio Combined Provincial SP Scores MCM and LCM scores combined Year S P S co re s Figure 5.34 of 3.82, a maximum of 13.91 (British Columbia in 2006) and a minimum of -15.4 (Prince Edward Island in 2005). Figure 5.3 represents the middle ground between the upper and lower bounds on CBC Radio\\'s performance established by the MCM and LCM scores. There is no greater likelihood of the Corporation\\'s actual performance corresponding to these values than to the MCM or LCM scores, or any other value between them.  It is important to keep this in mind when looking at the means. They are a useful illustration of CBC Radio\\'s performance, but by no means are they authoritative. Beyond comparing SP scores across geography, it is interesting to examine the scores on a chronological basis. 5.1 The Influence of 2005 The year 2005 saw a dip in SP scores for CBC Radio in every province across the country, with the exception of Quebec. The national aggregate MCM mean fell 1.88, from 1.02 in 2004 to -0.86 in 2005. The LCM mean dropped 2.29 to 8.68 in 2005 – the only year- over-year decrease between 1999 and 2007 excepting the 0.10 contraction seen between 2003 and 2004. Prince Edward Island suffered by far the biggest decreases. Its MCM SP score fell from -8.23 in 2004 to -1.61 in 2005, while its LCM score dropped from 8.43 to -7.07. British Columbia and Nova Scotia also suffered relatively drastic reductions of 4.59 and 4.43, respectively, in their MCM scores. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland\\'s LCM scores all dipped by approximately 5. The mean reduction among provinces was 4.13 and 4.42 for MCM and LCM scores, respectively. Only Quebec managed to increase its scores, going from 0.49  to 1.14 in MCM and 10.95 to 11.25 in LCM from 2004 to 2005. The influence of this unusual year is demonstrated in Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5. 44 Ignoring 2005, as Figure 5.5 does, makes CBC Radio\\'s national performance look more linear. It also improves the overall performance of CBC Radio nationally, bumping the MCM SP mean up to 0.79 from 0.61 and the LCM SP mean from 10.60 to 10.84. The reasons for this decline in 2005 are not immediately apparent. While some 32 new radio stations began broadcasting in 2005, increased competition seems an unlikely explanation, given that new stations opened up throughout the period under examination at an average of 25 per year. 32 is above this average, it is true, but the largest year-on-year increase of 35 occurs from 2006 to 2007, and in that period CBC Radio\\'s national SP scores go up by 1.17 (MCM) and 0.80 (LCM) in that same time. Further, no CBC stations opened or closed in Canada from from 2003 to 2007. Providing causal explanations is beyond the scope 45 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 National Performance of CBC Radio Year S P S co re Figure 5.44 of the present study, but the question of what happened to CBC Radio in 2005 is an interesting one that warrants further study. One possible explanation lies in the CBC labour disputes in August of that year. Thousands of CBC employees, including almost the entire production staff of every radio and television program outside of Moncton, New Brunswick and the province of Quebec, went on strike for almost two months (Ferguson 2007, 181-182). The lockout inspired spirited debate about public service broadcasting in Canada (see Ferguson 2007), but the lack of new programming produced by the CBC may have sent its audience elsewhere. That the lockout overlapped with the sampling period used by BBM to collect that data this study makes use of (see section 3.5) may have exacerbated the decline in SP scores. On the other hand, this study only examines CBC Radio\\'s audience performance, not what it actually broadcasts. Quality of programming presumably carries some weight in 46 Figure 5.54 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2006 2007 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 National Performance of CBC Radio 2005 Removed Year S P S co re determining a broadcaster\\'s market-share. One might examine CBC Radio\\'s programming to determine if it changed in some substantive fashion in 2005. Conversely, it may be that audience tastes and expectations changed in that year and CBC Radio\\'s programming did not. Future research could investigate these hypotheses to further our understanding the CBC and media markets more generally. 5.2 The Scores In Context Since assessing a media outlet\\'s performance using the method developed by Picard and deployed in this study is a comparatively new way of measuring media function, comparing the SP scores generated in this study to those of other research papers is difficult. Still, one of the advantages of Picard\\'s approach is that the scores it generates provide some insight in and of themselves. SP scores are, to an extent, meaningful on their own. The MCM and LCM SP scores for CBC Radio between 1999 and 2007 paint a variable picture of the state of the Corporation\\'s health across Canada during this period. CBC Radio stations in British Columbia outperform stations elsewhere by a significant margin. In contrast, the stations in Prince Edward Island perform below those in other provinces by a substantial margin. As illustrated by Figure 5.2, the stations in the other seven provinces generate scores much closer together, with a maximum of MCM SP of 5.22 (Ontario in 2007), a minimum of -4.2 (Manitoba in 2005) and a mean of 0.68. The LCM SP scores peak at 16.78 in British Columbia in 2007 while their minimum comes from Prince Edward Island in 2005 (-7.07). MCM SP scores in 2007 generally suggest an upward trend in the more recent years covered in the present study. Exceptions to this are Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, where scores decreased, and Manitoba, where the score remained the same as the previous year. The mean MCM SP score for all 10 provinces certainly suggests an upward trend in the 47 last three years of the examined period, rising from -0.86 in 2005 to 2.24 in 2006 and 3.41 in 2007 (see Figure 4.1). The LCM SP scores for the last three years of the study suggest less coherent movement. Prince Edward Island\\'s scores improve, jumping from -7.07 in 2005 to -2.69 in 2006 to 3.11 in 2007. Scores in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland also show consistent growth from 2005 to 2007. Saskatchewan, in contrast, has variable scores, growing from 5.53 in 2005 to 9.17 in 2006, but then shrinking to 7.47 in 2007. Still, average change from 2006 to 2007, is 0.59 – a positive value, possibly indicating future growth.  New research done with more recent market share data and radio station counts would be able to speak more to the duration and extent of a potential upward swing in SP scores for CBC Radio. Further research could also be done to better explain the unusual performance of CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island over the period studied here. As previously noted, CBC Radio there performs notably worse than it does compared to other provinces or to Canada as a whole. Perhaps this is attributable to the relatively small number of total stations in the province – there were six until 2005 when the total changed to seven. The average number of stations per province in a given year for this study is 76.9, and the province with the least stations outside of Prince Edward Island is Newfoundland and Labrador, which had 30 in 2007. Or, alternately, perhaps the population demographics of the Island are different from those of the other provinces in some fashion. It is also possible that CBC Radio might have trouble attracting the same quality of personnel to work for it there. These are tentative hypotheses that could be tested with more research to explain the sub-standard performance of CBC Radio in Prince Edward Island between 1999 and 2007. The national mean MCM score of 0.61 does suggest that this study\\'s hypothesis that CBC Radio\\'s performance would exceed expectations by a substantial margin is disproved. 48 MCM scores represent a lower bound of sorts on possible performance; it is entirely possible that a given station or group of stations performs at their MCM SP scores. Therefore, the national MCM mean of 0.61 means that this study\\'s hypothesis (that CBC Radio performed above expectations by a wide margin in every year) is rejected. One avenue of comparison for this study\\'s results that suggests itself is Picard\\'s original study. Examining market data from 1999, a time of increasing competition in broadcasting (Picard 2002a, 227), Picard found European television PSBs produced a wide value of Channel Performance scores, from the mid-30 scores of Denmark and Germany to Belgium\\'s -11.4 (ibid., 233). The scores have a mean of 18.45 when certain overlapping values are removed (e.g. the score for Ireland that ignores the role of PSB from the United Kingdom) (calculated from ibid.). Picard also provides table of market position, illustrating that all but two of the PSBs he studies lead their markets (ibid., 234). The performance of CBC Radio as measured in this study does not quite measure up with Picard\\'s results. Comparing his scores with the LCM scores generated in this study makes sense because they are generated with the same calculations. The national mean LCM score (10.60) is 7.85 points below the mean for European PSBs, though CBC\\'s lowest score (-7.07, earned by Prince Edward Island in 2005) is 4.33 points higher than the minimum score in Picard\\'s study (-11.4, earned by Belgian PSBs operating in France) (ibid., 233). This suggests that CBC Radio is performing at a lower level than European PSBs, and may need to consider methods of improving its market share. Explaining this difference could be done by future research. The histories and ages of the two industries may mean that radio is more mature and competitive, or that radio audiences behave differently than television ones. There might be a qualitative difference between the content produced by the various broadcasters in question that could help explain the differences. Or perhaps the broadcast content is largely similar and the audiences tastes differ. Alternately, the non-PSB stations in 49 the European markets may be less competitive with PSBs than their radio equivalents are in Canada. More research could further compare the Canadian and European media markets to better describe and understand where they overlap, as well as how and where they differ. The conclusion that CBC Radio is performing at a lower level than European PSBs rests on the assumption that this study presents an accurate performance of CBC Radio between 1999 and 2007. Future research could focus on establishing this with more rigor and certainty in a number of ways. First, more recent market share and radio station count data could be used to examine the performance of CBC Radio in the years since 2007. Studying past periods would also be useful for providing a sense of context and history for CBC Radio\\'s performance. Both types of research could also be done in a more chronologically detailed way, such as examining performance on a month-by-month basis (though this would require more frequent, and thus more expensive and time-consuming, audience surveys). Second, the geographic parsing of results employed in this study could be further broken down. Examining CBC Radio\\'s performance on a city-by-city basis, or, ideally, a station-by- station basis, would provide further findings of interest and a more nuanced portrait of the Corporation\\'s overall performance. 5.3 Interpreting the Findings This research sheds some light on CBC Radio\\'s performance in recent years, and attempts to address a small part of a research gap in Canadian communication literature. The theoretical framework outlined earlier in this study helps make further sense of the numbers produced by this study\\'s quantitative analysis. CBC Radio\\'s national MCM SP mean score of 0.61 over the period studied suggests that the radio division of Canada\\'s only national PSB may not be exceeding expected average performance by any great measure. 50 For CBC Radio, this research presents a challenge. This analysis suggests that its performance across Canada between 1999 and 2007 may have been below expectations in some provinces, particularly Prince Edward Island. The PSB\\'s performance in 2005, as measured through this analysis, also declines markedly. On the other hand, CBC Radio\\'s continued success in British Columbia could be counted as a cause for celebration. This study suggests that CBC Radio should be actively trying to increase its market share across Canada. However, it does indicate a positive trend in the national mean SP score\\'s last few years; possibly, this trend will continue. The scholarly implications of this research highlight the differences between public service broadcasting in Canada and Europe. Picard, examining European PSBs, found that most of them (e.g. those in Denmark, Italy, Germany, France, Finland, etc.) exceed performance by a substantial margin (Picard 2002a, 233). The results of this study present a somewhat different picture of the performance of one part of Canada\\'s most prominent PSB. Clearly, broadcasting markets behave differently in Canada and warrant their own study. Comparative research with other media markets could further illustrate the influence of national context on the performance of pubic service broadcasting. From a policy standpoint, this study is useful because it weighs the performance of CBC Radio against what can reasonably be expected of it. This helps to identify areas of performance above and below statistical expectations, which in turn could influence policy and research considerations. For example, a future content analysis could compare the practices of CBC Radio in British Columbia and Prince Edward Island to determine if differences in broadcast content contribute to the marked difference in performance. This research could also be paired with funding information to investigate the possibility of a relationship between finance structure and performance against expectations. This study provides a more meaningful measure of CBC Radio\\'s market performance between 1999 and 51 2007 than traditional market-share measures, and therefore its findings are relevant to any policy that refers to the health of public service broadcasting in Canada in these years. It is important to be mindful that market share is far from the only measure of a PSB\\'s success – it makes little sense to focus only on market performance while neglecting to consider the actual content being broadcast and how that content is produced. Eaman\\'s critique presents an important limitation to the present study: understanding CBC ratings in a more meaningful fashion does not necessarily lead to a greater understanding of the CBC\\'s influence on Canada, and nor does it directly correlate with the health of public service broadcasting in Canada (Eaman 1994). However, the market share of the CBC is still a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition for the success of public service broadcasting. This study is not a content analysis, but an assessment of the delivery of a public service. Such research is only worthwhile if the service in question is itself important. However, market share is still a metric of some influence, and this study suggests that CBC Radio may fail to measure up to it in some respects. Further research is required ascertain the extent and character of this failure, but this study indicates that between 1999 and 2007, CBC Radio faced significant challenges in some provinces to fulfilling its task of fostering national cohesion and collective identity across Canada. 52 Bibliography Anderson, R.

I owe particular thanks to my astute and diligent supervisors Dr. Mary Lynn Young and Alison Loat. This work could not have been accomplished without Dr. Young’s ability to see the bigger picture in both the fields of journalism and politics. I am grateful for Dr. Young’s mentorship, as well as her consistent encouragement and confidence in my work. I thank Alison Loat for her strategic advice, especially about how to study the relationship between the media and democracy. I am grateful for Alison Loat’s vision of a society defined by strong public leadership and active citizens. I am privileged to have been able to share in that vision through this work. I also owe gratitude to Dr. Michelle Stack, who provided exceptional guidance on the practical matters of research and provided coherent answers to my endless questions. Special thanks are owed to my husband, Marc Lindell, who holds inextricably high value for the work I do and my parents who taught me to have a vision of the world that goes beyond myself.   vi DEDICATION   To Richard Zantingh, who taught me to do my best and Marc Lindell, who always believes I can achieve it.     1 1. INTRODUCTION The Internet has opened a new and seemingly endless space for citizens to voice their opinions, express dissent or show support for politicians, government and public policy. The role of technology in political mobilization has enhanced democratic engagement in a number of recent elections globally. Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign encouraged widespread democratic involvement using the Internet. His website helped to organize 150,000 events and raise $600 million in campaign donations (Stirland 1). The Internet appeared to move the campaign beyond political elites and traditional media allowing the average American voter a voice in the debate. As Simon Rosenberg, president of a political think tank suggested, “[Obama’s] run a campaign where he’s used very modern tools, spoke to a new coalition, talked about new issues, and along the way, he’s reinvented the way campaigns are run” (Stirland 2008). The democratic power of the Internet was also on full display in the aftermath of the last Iranian presidential election. Twitter was used as a means to send messages about the political situation to the outside world and to organize protests and political action inside Iran (Lev Grossman 1). These examples raise an important research question: what is the relationship between online communication and political action in Canada?  This study seeks to examine a small part of this question, focusing on the role of online communication in election campaigns. My research examines the impact of new media forms on the political agenda focusing on the role of interactive online information in the 2008 Canadian federal and Vancouver municipal election and the 2009 British Columbia provincial election. I am particularly interested in the role of interactive online communication and journalism (i.e.   2 Twitter, Facebook, blogs and online forums) in developing and communicating campaign platforms. This research is important because while the Internet has become a site of political mobilization and expression in recent elections, media studies literature on the role of online communication and journalism in Canadian elections is underdeveloped despite the high levels of Internet use in this country (Fletcher and Zamaria 17). The Canadian attitude towards Internet empowerment does not resonate with recent real world events and thus warrants further investigation. According to the Canadian Internet Project’s 2007 survey, 54 per cent of Canadian homes have broadband access and 88 per cent of Canadians 12 years or older have been online (Fletcher and Zamaria 5,8). Canadians spend an average of 15 hours online each week and use the Internet for a variety of purposes including email, entertainment, information seeking, social networking and news reading (Fletcher and Zamaria 5). Over 40 per cent of Canadian Internet-users have visited a community or social- networking site (Fletcher and Zamaria 14), which have been catalysts for political action in other countries. Moreover, news sites are among the most popular online destinations with 79 per cent of Internet-users going online to look for news (Fletcher and Zamaria 12). Media and political marketing strategists provide glimpses of the impact of Internet mobilization on Canadian democracy. For example, in a 2009 Toronto Star article, Alexandre Sevigny, a communication professor at McMaster University, attributes the eventual inclusion of Elizabeth May, the leader of the federal Green Party, in the 2008 leaders’ debate to pressure from MySpace users. Sevigny asserts that Internet pressure forced Stéphane Dion to stand up for May and led to her inclusion in the debate (Diebel 1). A 2009 political communications industry study surveyed parliamentarians and asked them about how they use and respond to online communication and the grassroots campaigns that employ them. Their initial findings were that MPs are not well positioned to develop online relationships and use the web tools for politics (Meyers, Nanos and Thompson 1).   3 Other studies have shown Canadians are sceptical about empowerment and the Internet. The Canadian Internet Project found that online civic engagement is low with fewer than one in five people using the Internet to communicate with an elected official or civil servant (Fletcher and Zamaria 15). According to the project’s findings, “Canadians are not convinced of the empowerment potential of the Internet; only one in four thinks the Internet can give them more political power or influence the government” (Fletcher and Zamaria 16). While overall Canadians are unconvinced of the Internet’s role in facilitating political action, there are small subsections of the population who are increasing their online civic engagement, specifically francophones and females (Fletcher and Zamaria 16). So just how is the Internet used in Canadian elections and what are the implications for democracy. My research seeks to take a first step towards answering this question by examining the use of online media in three of the most recent Canadian election campaigns. By studying how political strategists used interactive online communication and journalism in the 2008-09 federal, provincial and municipal election campaigns, my research seeks to uncover the impact of online communication tools on the development and communication of political campaign platforms. I will build on recent studies and theoretical expositions of the power of digital media to create political action. This work will just be a small snapshot of the role that online political mobilization has in the Canadian context at one particular point in history, but it seeks to establish a pilot for academic inquiry into future campaigns. This research also fits into an important academic debate about the role online communication plays in creating political action. It is to this debate this paper now turns.   4 2. LITERATURE REVIEW My research is situated within a larger body of literature that seeks to explore a related set of conceptual themes and relationships. Most broadly, this work seeks to examine whether the Internet changes politics, whether political culture is reflected online or whether the relationship is more complex. Thus, my study is situated in the debate between technological determinists and social determinists, which will be discussed subsequently. More specifically, my research raises questions about the existence of enhanced opportunities for citizens to influence policy and better make their will known to politicians during election campaigns as a result of online communication tools. The next section will examine empirical studies about how politicians have been influenced by and are employing these new tools. Specifically, it will examine recent empirical studies on the Internet’s role during election campaigns and then move on to consider the theories, technological and social determinism, that inform the field. More nuanced approaches to the role of the Internet in political campaigns will also be considered including theories of networking and agenda setting. It will conclude with a consideration of the role of the campaign itself in developing in policymaking and communications. 2.1 The Role of Online Communications in Elections Literature The rising power of the Internet in recent elections in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom has prompted empirical studies that examine how online political tools have been used during elections and their impact on political engagement. Some studies from the political communication and political science literatures (Panagopoulos and Bergan 2009, Dale and Strauss 2009, Cornfield and Kaye 2009) have demonstrated that political parties are using the Internet as an extension of traditional campaign tools. For example, Panagopoulos   5 and Bergan conclude that the Internet has become essential for fundraising, with presidential hopeful John Kerry raising $82 million in 2003 and presidential incumbent George W. Bush eliciting $13 million (Panagopoulos and Bergan 128). The researchers also found that these fundraising acts are likely to be accompanied by other political action. “Online donors take on average one additional action on the activism scale (134).” The conclusions of the previously cited studies are broadly that the Internet helps parties connect with voters in ways that mirror traditional campaign functions such as fundraising, advertising, eliciting new memberships, volunteer recruitment, getting out the vote and disseminating messages. Other studies (Gueorguieva 2009, Slotnick 2009, Williams and Gulati 2009) focus on the political adoption of social media such as Facebook, MySpace and YouTube. These studies show politicians use social media sites for political advertising and for extending the reach of political messaging through networks. The literature demonstrates that politicians recognize the potential to reach formerly unreachable voters through online networks, a new application of the old campaign practice of meeting and greeting. Williams and Gulati find a correlation between the number of friends a candidate has on Facebook and the final electoral outcome (279). They hypothesize the relationship reflects the success of the grassroots campaign (Williams and Gulati 286). Gueorguieva asserts that YouTube has fundamentally changed the communicative style of politicians forcing them to appear more natural and honest (241). As Gueorguieva states, “The advent of YouTube changed the way politicians communicate with voters. Political analysts predict that YouTube will force candidates to be more natural, direct and honest, since they might be filmed anywhere and anytime…” (241). Yet, despite a growing online presence, some scholars have concluded that message control still defines every way politicians use the Internet (Panagopolous 13, Kifer, Druckman and Parkin 41). In the Canadian context, Peter Smith and Peter Chen assessed the online presence of political parties in the 2008 federal election. Smith and Chen argue that online tools are   6 adopted when there are few barriers (12). In contradiction to Williams and Gulati, the researchers find that the number of friends politicians have online does not translate into votes (13). Instead, they conclude that due to their minimal presence on social networks candidates do not see social networking as the best investment (Smith and Chen 13). If candidates saw social networking services as a useful means to access different constituencies online…it would be reasonable to expect candidates would employ large numbers of social networking profiles…..[however] there is no relationship between candidates’ use of social networking services and their market share, indicating that use of these services tended towards symbolic association with the channel, rather than seeing specific benefit in the communities represented in these services” (Smith and Chen 13).  Canadian politicians also demonstrate a preference for traditional campaign tools such as face-to-face communication, but have a growing appreciation for online tools especially websites (Smith and Chen 17). While Smith and Chen provide an exceptional baseline assessment of which tools political parties used, they do not say whether the online presence of political parties impacted policy decisions, nor did they assess if politicians actually engaged with voters online. Hun Myoung Park and James L. Perry find that an online presence could have an impact on campaign outcomes. Citizens who read websites are 20 per cent more likely to send an email urging other people to vote, 10 per cent more likely to attend a rally and 11.2 per cent more likely to give money to a candidate (Park and Perry 108-114). A similar relationship was found to be true for online donors in another study (Panagopoulos and Bergan 2009:134). The researchers do not however explain the mechanics of this relationship.  There is less evidence in the literature that the online presence of politicians has created a two-way dialogue that lead to changes in the policy agenda. Steven Schneider and Kirsten Foot’s assessment of the 2000 and 2004 American presidential elections demonstrates that the online activities of political parties did a good job of informing, but were   7 not successful in truly connecting or mobilizing (27). Other scholars examined blogs with a similar conclusion. Roland Abold’s study of citizen weblogs in the 2005 German election argues that in a post-modern campaign politicians need to target specific groups and blogs can help achieve that goal (211). Theoretically, Abold is optimistic about the democratic potential of blogs arguing that they dismantle barriers to political discussion and break open the public agenda (214). However, Abold’s research, based on survey research, concludes differently. Respondents reported that weblogs have minimal effect; only 25 per cent believed blogs were credible and 18 per cent believed they influenced public opinion (Abold 229). Abold concludes that weblogs only attract people who are already politically involved and have little impact on opening up debate (230).  One thing that is empirically clear is that web campaigning is now central to elections in Western democracies. As Schneider and Foot state, “Web campaigning moved from the exotic and exploratory fringes of the electoral arena to its very core (190).” Based on their extensive study of American elections, Schneider and Foot believe the online sphere provides more opportunities for political action and fundamentally changes how politicians and citizens perceive themselves and their role in democracy—a suggestion that taps into larger questions about the impact of technology on culture and democracy which will now be discussed. 2.2 The Internet: Revolutionary Force or Reinforcing Power? 2.2.1 Revolutionary Force: Technological Determinism While this study is focused on a narrow question related to the relationship between online communication and the development and communication of the campaign platform, the overarching aim of this research is rooted larger debates about the relationship between the media, information technology and democracy. The Internet has many characteristics that elicit scholarly optimism. It is interactive, instant and interconnected. It has the power to allow direct communication enabling citizens   8 to set the public agenda and demand the attention of politicians. The Internet was also seen as a tool to provide voters with pertinent information and give them a space to act. In short, optimists suggest technological advances would lead to advanced democracy. The view that technology drives social and political change is called technological determinism and set its theoretical roots long before the development of the worldwide web. Media theorist Marshall McLuhan is likely the best-known technological determinist. Claiming that the medium is the message, McLuhan argued information technology drove human development. He posited that electronic media created a global village, fundamentally changing the way we do things (Littlejohn 267). Quoting McLuhan, Stephen Littlejohn states: “[Media] is forcing us to reconsider and re-evaluate practically every thought, every action and every institution formerly taken for granted….They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered.” (Littlejohn 267-268). McLuhan died before the Internet took hold, but scholar Paul Levinson pushed the theory into the digital age. Levinson asserts moving content online has a profound democratizing consequences. Unlike our experience with books, newspapers, and magazines, which for all but a tiny fraction of the population has been a one-way engagement of reading, not writing; the online experience is two-way, allowing readers to contribute via email, bulletin board discussion and all the manner of annotation as they navigate the web…Indeed, with the exception of the telegraph and the telephone, whose content was always written or spoke by its users, the Internet and its tributaries reverse the trajectory of a handful of messages to a legion of passive users that has typified all technological media since the printing press (38).  For technological determinists, the Internet presents a new form of media that has the capacity to fundamentally change the way citizens interact and how they form their social and political structures. It puts citizens back into control. McLuhan’s mentor, Canadian media theorist Harold Innis, was one of the founding thinkers about the emanicpatory power of the media—the same emancipatory power that has excited technological optimists. Innis’ Empire and Communications demonstrates that empires are propped up by monopolies of knowledge (Littlejohn 266). That is the powerful in   9 society control access to and the distribution of knowledge. As new media technologies like the printing press come onto the scene and change access to knowledge they challenge this power (Littlejohn 266). Building on Innis’ theories, technology optimists assert the Internet causes a fundamental shift in the production and distribution of knowledge forcing change in the political loci of power. As an expression of this optimism, John Barlow wrote “A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace” in 1996. The treatise asserts the freedom of online expression for all societal groups, regardless of race, class or values, without government interference, stating, “I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us” (Barlow 1). This treatise expresses the idea that the technology has power against social and political forces, an ironic assertion considering the Internet was designed as a tool for intra-government communications. Some scholars have applied the frame of technological determinism to recent political developments. In their book Millennial Makeover, Moreley Winograd and Michael D. Hais argue the character of the Internet, coupled with a web-savvy, networked generation will create a political realignment in the United States. The authors assess the technological developments adopted into the everyday lives of the new generation including peer-to-peer and networked technologies and assert the ability of these technologies to connect people, share information and allow every citizen to be a producer of information would play an important role in political realignment (Winograd and Hais 152). The authors assert this new world will undercut former political institutions such as traditional media and the primacy of fund-raising and allow every citizen to disseminate his or her own ideas (Winograd and Hais 154). Contrary to technological determinists, other scholars suggest the relationship between technology and political change is too simplistic and flows in the wrong direction, a theoretical proposition to which I now turn.   10 2.2.2 Reinforcing Power: Social Determinism Social determinists are more sceptical about the Internet’s potential for greater citizen impact on the political action and public policy. Theorists such as Lelia Green (2001) invert the relationship set out by technological determinists. For Green, technology is the dependent variable. Society is responsible for the adoption and implementation of new technologies (Green 3). Class, race, gender create power imbalances that impact the ways in which new technologies are used (Green 5). Instead of levelling the playing field, social determinists would assert “technologies express the priorities of those who champion them” (Green 6). This perspective allows for positive changes if people are interested and involved in using technology to advance values like democracy for example (Green 9). Overcoming the influence of the powerful in society who may not see widespread democratization in their best interests will simply be challenging. Another theorist, Michael Schudson, asserts that technology is simply not decisive when it comes to democracy, instead we have to look at the character of the political culture in which technology operates (7). Thus, any sort of emancipatory action or protests we see online can be explained by the decline of cultural authority that defines society (Schudson 7). Schudson maps the decline in authority of the news media and the changing face of an ideal democracy asserting the current political era is one where rights and activism are important (Schudson 13). He also asserts that the Internet will reflect activism, not necessarily create more of it—it amplifies existing forces (Schudson 13). Jodi Dean (2005) is another media democracy sceptic. In her article “Communicative Capitalism: Circulation and the Foreclosure of Politics,” Dean asserts politicians are not engaging in online dialogue, but are simply using networking communications like the Internet to flood the airwaves with their own ideas. The power relations inherent in society are simply reflected online, undermining any new opportunities for diversity (Dean 56). Dean disputes the value of online messages because, while they may be abundant, they do not elicit   11 responses (Dean 58). This misunderstanding of messages leads to what Dean calls the fantasy of participation and technological fetishism. “…They believe that they are active, maybe even that they are making a difference simply by clicking on a button, adding their name to a petition or commenting on a blog” (Dean 60). Dean labels this as interpassivity and asserts that it is depoliticizing by displacing real world struggles (Dean 61). 2.2.3 A More Nuanced Role The role of technology in enhancing democracy may be more nuanced than either camp proposes. For instance, theorists such as Wade Rowland assert that different types of technologies have different impacts on democracy. As Rowland states: Today, among the democracies of the world, communications technologies tend to be accepted as tools of liberation, weapons against oppression, and guarantors of freedom. But not all communications technologies have the same impact on democratic institutions… (224).  Using the work of Emile Durkheim and Jurgen Habermas, Rowland distinguishes two societal outcomes of different media. The first is mechanical solidarity or a society held together by criminal law and paternal authorities (224). The second outcome is organic solidarity, which is defined by consensus, customs and continuing conversation among diverse individuals (250). Rowland separates media according to their role in creating these two different types of solidarities or integrations. Broadcast technologies like television and radio are grouped as mechanical because these technologies are largely controlled by powerful elites and offer little airtime to citizens (Rowland 251). Telephone, mail and the Internet are deemed organic technologies (Rowland 251). The Internet has a different nature than broadcasters. The Net was defined by a set of open and non-proprietary protocols that allow free and open access without any need for licensing or identification or fees or permissions, because it was designed for research and communications, not commerce or control (Rowland 398).    12 Organic media is important to democracy because it facilitates conversations and self- organization. The character of organic media creates social change. It is not technologically deterministic. Instead, the character of the media tempers determinism. Rowland identifies several social changes. The first change is interactivity. … the ability to interact in something close to real time with information courses (to query, comment, challenge, suggest) encourages conversation as opposed to monologue, and in doing so promotes the communication of understanding as opposed to purely instrumental communication (Rowland 418).  The second socio-political change identified by Rowland is the opening up of politics because the Internet is a low-barrier, low-cost communication technology which increases political involvement defined as the ability of people to give “political expression to their ideas and beliefs” (Rowland 419). Organic media is also defined by its networked nature and its ability to reproduce offline communities online as well as its tendency to produce new networks. Networks have a long-standing relationship to politics. Elihu Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld (1957) proposed a two- step flow theory of communication in which mass media messages flow through social networks and are mediated by the network’s social class, values, age, gender and education (Newton 210). Judith Trent and Robert Friedenberg’s analysis of campaign communication suggests that politicians use their networks or “social precincts” to test out the reaction to key speeches and decisions (Trent and Friedenberg 302). Politicians will then determine which issues resonate and can be used in a campaign platform. In today’s media environment, the Internet couples the forces of technology and personal networks through its interactivity. Winograd and Hais foreshadow the potential for social networks to merge with media and influence the political agenda. The Internet has put social networks online in an accessible, digestible format. These social networks are now producing and disseminating political information. Winograd and Hais assert that reaching these voters requires that politicians engage online (Winograd and Hais 170).   13 Other scholars point to a marriage between politics and technology where both come out changed. In his examination of new media campaigns, Philip N. Howard (2006) suggests there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between technologies and society, stating: Technologies and social organizations evolve together…the search for the net effects of new media must move beyond technology diffusion questions to an examination of how technology and democratic institutions are growing together through technical and political decisions that simultaneously shape organizational constraints and capacities (38).  Technology cannot be understood outside of political culture and our understanding of political culture will not be complete without an understanding of technology’s role. American political scientist Bruce Bimber also adheres to a more nuanced view of the role of technology. Bimber places a heavy emphasis on the power of technology, but distinguishes his theoretical position from that of technological and social determinism. He suggests technology is political and can create new behaviours and institutional rules, but it does not necessarily do so (Bimber 32). However, it is not just technology, but the information flows it can deliver that create change. Bimber asserts that information is vital to democracy: In the processes by which citizen preferences are formed and aggregated, in the behaviours of citizens and elites, in formal procedures of representation, in acts of governmental decision making, in the administration of laws and regulations, and in the mechanisms of accountability that freshen democracy and sustain its legitimacy (Bimber 11).  Bimber’s analysis concludes that the Internet has shaped American politics because it makes information cheap, decentralized and widely distributed (229). He suggests that these features are changing political intermediation, organization and mobilization (229). On the other side of the democratic equation however, political engagement has been largely unaffected by the Internet. The Internet simply reinforces existing patterns of engagement (Bimber 229). Bimber also acknowledges the role of power in information distribution stating that access is unequal, mirroring traditional social inequalities and the Internet is no different (243).   14 2.2.4 The Relationship between Media and Political Decision-Making Finally, any role the Internet may play in shaping politics should also be considered with respect to studies that examine how media influence political discourse. One of the most developed theories on the relationship between media and politics is agenda-setting theory. The theory is founded on the work of Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw who studied how media coverage of political campaigns influenced the agenda of the campaign. “The mass media force attention to certain issues by constantly presenting objects and suggesting what individuals in the mass should think about, know about and have feelings about” (McCombs and Shaw 177). The media places issues in the minds of citizens and in doing so forces the public action on these matters. McCombs and Shaw hypothesize that “the mass media set the agenda for each political campaign, influencing the salience of attitudes toward the political issues” (McCombs and Shaw 177). They found issues covered in the news correlated with those that resonated with voters, and interpret this as evidence for mass media influence. The research allows for hypothesis building around the power of new media to influence public opinion and political action. Since McCombs and Shaw’s study, other researchers have sought to test the original agenda-setting theory with mixed success. Most of the studies demonstrate that the agenda- setting theory is contingent on external factors (Walgrave and Van Aelst 2006, Davis 2007). Steven Walgrave and Peter Van Aelst sketch out a more flexible theory of agenda-setting that is contingent on the numbers of sources for information, politicians use of the media to test political ideas, the extent to which media is seen as reflecting public opinion and institutional rules of the game (100-101). In a study of British parliamentarians, Aeron Davis comes to similar conclusions about the contingency of agenda-setting. Davis concludes that media attention on issues can shift political agendas and policy development, but not by simple stimulus-response (Davis 102). The agenda is dependent on politicians’ strategic use of the media (what can they get the journalists to communicate) and on the feedback given by   15 journalists on policy issues (Davis 184). Davis’ work allows politicians to be conceptualized as strategic actors whose agendas are not only influenced by media, but who try to influence the public agenda through media. In new interactive media forms, politicians can attempt to influence the public agenda to align with their political agenda unmediated. Agenda-setting theory is generally applied to traditional media, but extended to online communication, this premise means that issues debated on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc., become highlighted in the minds of politicians and the public as issues that require action. The promise of the Internet is that traditional media and journalists would not be the only actors producing content and thus setting the agenda, but that individuals, especially marginalized individuals, would have a chance to get issues on the agenda. In a 2009 study, Paul Wallenfelsz and Kelly Wallenfelsz compare the agenda-setting power of traditional and new media and find the agenda-setting effect weaker in people who used new media more frequently (Wallenfelsz and Wallenfelsz 11). The media is not able to play a gatekeeper role on the Internet as people pick their stories. They conclude that, while there is much work to do on new media and agenda-setting, its impacts can no longer be ignored (Wallenfelsz and Wallenfelsz 12). 2.3 The Role of the Campaign in Policy-Making and Communications Another important body of literature that informs this study concerns the purpose of political campaigns. Former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell is famous for saying, “Elections are no time to debate the issues” and there is a substantial body of literature examining the purpose of elections. This section will first look at how policy-making fits into a campaign and then will turn to the role of campaign communications. According to numerous scholars, elections are about winning, not about policy development. Political scientist William Cross argues political parties have long seen their role   16 as electoral machines (Cross 425). Cross uses the findings of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing to demonstrate this point quoting: The dilemma is that the core of the party organization is concerned primarily with elections: it is much less interested in discussing and analyzing political issues that are not connected directly to winning the next election, or in attempting to communicate the broader values of the party (Cross 434).  In his book Political Parties, Cross makes it clear that the primary role of political parties is waging an election campaign (108) and that this war is not one for amateurs stating: The central campaigns are not participatory exercises; rather, they are dominated by a small group of seasoned campaigners and close associates of the party leaders….Two groups tend to take over the parties’ central operations during election campaigns: individuals with long-standing connections to the party leader, and experienced professionals with particular campaign-related skills (122).  Policy-making is left to elected politicians in between elections when parties can employ the resources of the state to help (Cross 426). Cross’ assessment of the policy-making opportunities available flies in the face of Internet democracy optimists who argue the online world is going to strengthen democracy. While the Internet may open up opportunities for de- professionalization of politics, the current Canadian political culture of campaigning may not be amenable.  While politicians may not be spending much time policymaking during the campaign, they do exert a huge amount of energy devising campaign communications. One of the most prominent theories seeking to explain how campaign platforms and policies are developed and communicated during election campaigns is that of political marketing. As defined by Jennifer Lees-Marshment (2004), political marketing is “the study of how politicians interface with their electorate” (3). In a framework of political marketing, political parties and politicians use professionalized tools such as public opinion research and market research to decide which policies or products to pursue (Lilleker and Lees-Marshment 7). After determining the appropriate product, political parties use marketing communication tools to sell the product.   17 Effective communication will result in an election win (Lilleker and Lees-Marshment 11). In this theory, professionalized marketing tools and public opinion research are the key forces determining political action, not the citizen dialogue that Internet optimists see driving the future of politics. In the book What are Campaigns For? James A. Gardner (2009) examines the disappointment with the quality of deliberative democracy and dialogue during a campaign. Gardner asserts that campaigns are not and should not be expected to be the formative grounds for public opinion (147). He believes it is acceptable for the campaign to be “tabulative” of the existing political thoughts of the electorate instead of persuading them to adopt new ones. The way candidates and especially voters behave during campaigns tends to reflect social norms that also guide their behaviour at other times, and it is implausible to think that people who behave one way all the time will suddenly behave in another way simply because the calendar tells them so (191).  Thus, there is no need to put pressure on campaigns to be an extraordinary site of deliberative democracy and expression of the public will (Gardner 193). The main purpose of campaigns in the literature then is not deliberative engagement or collaborative policy- making, it is using the necessary communication tools to get into office and these communications tools have changed with the rise of the Internet, warranting greater study. 2.4 Theoretical Framework This literature has informed the theoretical standpoint which I use to help explain and understand the data. While technological determinists assert, technology has a powerful role to play in politics, and society in general, scholars such as Bimber, Dean and Schudson make strong arguments that technology is limited by the current norms and practices that define political culture itself. During an election campaign one of the most important forces influencing the power of the Internet to change politics is the current campaign models   18 outlined by the work of Cross and Lilleker and Lees-Marshment. Thus, in the context of an election it will be important to study how technology interacts with these established campaign models. Neither technology nor society is independent, but they shape each other either forcing change or reinforcing the status quo. This framework will help provide insight on some of the areas that past research has not sufficiently addressed. The current body of literature does not address whether or not politicians, strategists and parties are actually listening to the voices they hear online. This is an important question because even if technological optimists can prove the Internet expands the number of voices in the public realm, it is hard to argue its democratic value if politicians are not incorporating those voices into the way they govern. Moreover, this paper will go into greater depth about if and how interactive online media has changed campaign messaging. The amount of change the Internet has produced in recent Canadian elections will be studied through qualitative interviews. I will now outline the methods employed during this study before assessing the findings.   19 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Research Approach This research study is qualitative and examines the norms and practices of political strategists with respect to online communications during the process of an election campaign. Qualitative research allows researchers to explore complex events and phenomenon. It also allows for contextualized analysis. Elections are multi-dimensional events characterized by complex relationships. While quantitative analysis is appropriate for some aspects of election study such as voter turnout or demographic analysis, it is less useful for examining the relationships between policy development, political communication, voters and online communication tools.  This study adopts qualitative researcher Yvonna S. Lincoln’s approach to epistemology. Lincoln states, “Qualitative research is conducted not to confirm or disconfirm earlier findings, but rather to contribute to a process of continuous revision and enrichment of understanding of the experience or form of action under study” (Lincoln 278). It seeks to explore the relationships between campaigning and online communications and build on the debate occurring in the academic research. Moreover, it presents an assessment of a particular event within a particular community at a given time. In order to explore the new media practices of political parties, this study employs a qualitative research method of open-ended, semi-structured interviews. 3.2 Research Question An assessment of the literature has informed the research question this study seeks to answer: How are political strategists in Canada using interactive online communication /social media and new forms of online journalism to shape the development and communication of campaign platforms?   20 3.3 Interviews Interviews with political strategists are an appropriate way to study this topic because it is a study of a complex political process. Qualitative researchers Herbert J. Rubin and Irene S. Rubin (2005) describe the strengths of interviewing as “especially good at describing social and political process, that is, how and why things change” (Rubin and Rubin 3). My work seeks to examine political change and its relationship to online media technologies. In doing so, it requires more than just quantitative research, but needs to collect data on how the participants involved with the campaign process, particularly political strategists, understand, interpret and react to innovations in information technology. This research technique is referred to as semi-structured interviewing, a process of asking focused, but flexible questions to allow participants to expand on ideas and meanings (Rubin 5). I decided to interview seven strategists from competing parties who played decision- making roles during the most recent federal election, provincial election and municipal election involving political parties in English Canada. Six of the nine parties that won seats in the 2008 and 2009 elections are included in the study. This includes two of three municipal parties, two of two provincial parties, and two of four federal parties. The majority of past research has relied on content analysis or surveying, but by interviewing political strategists my research taps into a new source of knowledge. I allowed decision-makers to address how different variables interacted during a campaign. Political communication strategists were the subjects of study because of their role in advising which online tools should be employed and monitoring online conversations. Thus, they are sources of critical information for other members of the campaign teams. Moreover, these strategists are a key part of the campaign team and participate in and/or observe the decision-making processes. The decision to interview political strategists relies on several assumptions that are supported in the literature. Interviews allow researchers to explore topics in depth and allow research participants to bring new ideas to the table (Rubin and Rubin 33). It also allows for the revelation of complex   21 and nuanced relationships and can answer why certain effects occur instead of simply examining patterns (Rubin and Rubin 21). Other forms of data collection were considered, but were deemed unsuitable for the type of information desired. Surveying would not have allowed for the open-ended questioning desired and would be less likely to reveal complicated cause-and-effect relationships. Similarly, a content analysis would largely address how citizens started talking about an issue online and when it appeared in a political platform. It does not have the power to make conclusive claims about the cause and effect relationship between political conversations online and the content of election platforms. This methodology has proven effective in Davis’ study of the media’s impact on issue agendas in the United Kingdom. The interview format revealed a complex and nuanced relationship between the government agenda and the media. It allowed Davis to uncover the fact that media attention shifts political agendas and policy development, but it does so through a complex, multi-faceted relationship instead of the simple model of assuming that citizen pressure puts an issue on the agenda (Davis 182). 3.3.1 Participant Recruitment I sought out subjects in a variety of ways. Contacting party offices was often the first step in identifying individual research subjects. There was also a public media trail identifying possible research participants. Moreover, I used my personal networks to identify individuals who would be able to direct me to appropriate participants in my study. Once a pool of potential interviewees was established, I sent formal emails introducing myself and explaining the purpose and procedure of my study. I followed up with telephone calls or email to confirm the possibility of their participation. In other instances, individuals provided me with the contact information for a person that worked more closely with the online campaign. Subsequently, an appropriate interview time was established with those   22 interested in participating.1 The interviews were in person or by phone depending on the location of the interviewees. 3.3.2 Data Analysis and Collection The data collection process consisted of semi-structured interviews ranging from one to one-and-a-half hours. I asked participants questions from an initial list developed previously. Questions were developed based on research objectives and were linked to the theoretical and conceptual issues identified in the literature review. Interview questions were adapted to each individual to allow interviewees to have influence in leading the conversation and emphasizing the aspects on the online campaign they believed were most important (See Appendix A for a list of questions). All interviews were tape-recorded with participants’ permission and transcribed fully for data analysis. Copies of the transcripts were provided to each interviewee for review. Data collected during the interview process was coded thematically as per methods laid out by Rubin and Rubin (209-223). The coding was done within two weeks of each interview. This process followed an open coding process in which any and all potential concepts that exist in the data are labelled against a key of codes that include a definition and a description of how to know when the concepts exists. Subsequently, I highlighted the most relevant concepts as part of a focused coding process. The important concepts that emerged are the major points of discussion in the final analysis.  1 Interviewees were provided with an informed consent form to sign as per UBC research ethics standards (See Appendix B for ethics certificate). The consent form allowed them to request anonymity. Confidentiality was desired by most participants. To protect the confidentiality of participants and the information they provided, the interviews and transcripts were only accessed by the researchers and were kept in a secure location. The interviewees also had the freedom to choose the location of the interview if done in person. Phone interviews were conducted in a private room. Interviewees will only be identified by numbers in the remainder of this study to protect their identities.   23 3.3.3 Research Limitations Before analyzing the data collected through the interviews, it is important to highlight the limitations of the study. Primarily, the sample size of political strategists, while representative of those involved in the elections studied, is small. Moreover, the study examines three specific events meaning the results are not generalizable. These elections are bounded in time, historical circumstances and are defined by the politicians, strategists and citizens participating in them. Instead, this study is meant to reveal patterns, which could serve to as a starting point for other studies and can contribute to theory-building in this field. This goal is consistent with those set out by qualitative researchers. For example, Earl Babbie and Lucia Benaquisto state, “A major goal in the analysis of qualitative data is to reveal themes that emerge from data. This process is largely a search for patterns of similarities and differences, followed by an interpretation of those patterns” (392). Other researchers point to the value of these uncovered patterns for theory elaboration. Rubin and Rubin suggest information from particular cases can help contribute to existing theories by pushing them further or challenging their applicability (7). This is consistent with the view that there are local forms of truth that may not be generalizable, but can be a valid contribution to our understanding of social phenomena. In arguing research should be considered valid based on its design and execution rather than on the positivist “trinity of reliability, validity and generalization” (Kvale 37), Steiner Kvale has written: The present understanding of validity starts in the lived world and daily language, where issues of reliable witnesses, of valid documents and arguments, are part of the social interaction…It accepts the possibility of specific local, personal, and community forms of truth, with a focus on daily life and local narrative (21).  Thus, while this study may not be generalizable, it has been designed with the principles of accuracy, thoroughness and believability in mind (Rubin and Rubin 769-70). It seeks to make a small contribution to a growing field of study.   24 4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 4.1 Cases in Context Before presenting the findings of my research, a brief contextualization of the elections studied is warranted. In 2008-2009, Canadians living in British Columbia faced three separate elections. The first of these elections was the federal election held on October 14, 2008. The incumbent party was the Conservative Party of Canada led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. There were five primary parties in contention for seats including the Conservative Party, Liberal Party, New Democratic Party, Bloc Quebecois and Green Party. The result of the election had the Conservative Party win a minority government. Voter turnout was 58.8 per cent, the lowest recorded in Canadian history (Elections Canada 2008). Shortly after, the City of Vancouver held a municipal election on November 15, 2008. Vancouver’s municipal government is a party system with three primary parties vying for seats on city council. These parties are Vision Vancouver, Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) and the Non-Partisan Alliance (NPA). The result of the election had Vision Vancouver win the majority of the council seats with COPE winning two seats and the NPA winning one. The final election was held on May 12, 2009 at the provincial level with the BC Liberal Party, the BC New Democratic Party and the Green Party as the three parties in contention for seats. The BC Liberal Party came out with a majority government, winning 46 per cent of the popular vote. Voter turnout was a mere 50 per cent (CBC 2009). This paper will now examine the specific themes uncovered during the course of the interviews.    25 4.2 Political Parties Extend Old Habits Online While campaigns were optimistic about the Internet’s capacity to reach voters and the media in new ways, the interviews suggested online campaign strategies were largely reactionary and their execution presented a migration of the traditional campaign onto a new platform. The interview material suggests that the use of technology is contingent on social forces as well as existing norms and practices of political campaigning in line with theories elucidated by Lelia Green and Michael Schudson. This section presents reasons why parties decided to campaign online and discusses how the Internet influences traditional campaign practices. It will conclude with an assessment of how the literature helps explain the themes. 4.2.1 Following the Audience Online A common theme throughout the interviews was that parties were driven online by the sheer size of the audience. With voters and journalists already online, Internet campaigning was seen as a necessary part of doing business. The growing number of voters using the Internet as part of their daily lives appeared to be the driving force behind the development of an online campaign. As one strategist summarized, We can see the research coming out that voters are getting more and more of their news from online sources and less from traditional print and television media. We adjusted our engagement strategy to start to use these tools, if nothing else, as something to try to communicate with people in the way they are seeking out information (Strategist A).  Strategists recognized the fact that digital media was an essential part of people’s lifestyles and that politics had to follow. As those platforms grow and people use digital tools to communicate together, the impact of digital on a campaign will become more profound because it is just where people spend their time (Strategist B).  Strategists explained there were consequences to staying offline. “It’s a way of life and failing to engage people in the way they communicate means you aren’t going to reach them”   26 (Strategist C). As evidence of the primacy of digital media in the lives of voters, many political strategists cited the high traffic to party websites during the election campaign. Several strategists also talked about the mainstream media being a key online audience. “The biggest factor is the reporters sitting there in front of their computer. They are the ones that are the interpreter to the general public more than the Internet is” (Strategist A). With reporters doing more and more reporting from their offices, this strategist underscored the importance of providing the media with accessible information. However, it went beyond just providing information. For all of the interviewees, innovative online campaigning was a method of gaining media attention from print, television and radio outlets. “Partially, it’s about getting these process stories written because the mainstream press gets bored some days and wants to write about something else and they will write about your new media strategy” (Strategist D). Many strategists could think of examples of media coverage of the online campaign including stories about viral video, a digital van that toured British Columbia, and social media campaigns. The strategists recognized that the media coverage of new media was driven by the novelty of some of the online tools such as Twitter. Some political strategists mentioned fear of bad press if they were not online. For example, a political strategist explained, “You can’t not do it or there will be a story about how your party isn’t engaged with young people or isn’t using new media tools” (Strategist C). In effect, it appears that political parties reacted to the practices of voters and the media in their campaigning practices rather than leading the way. At the same time during the course of the interviews, it became quite evident that the online campaign was not only reactionary, but also it extended traditional campaign tools. 4.2.2 Traditional Campaign Activities in a Digital Age The Internet is breathing new life into traditional campaign instead of creating a transformation of the campaign process. Political strategists explained that volunteering,   27 databank management, door-knocking, phone calls, and leaders tours are imperative to getting out the content of campaign platforms and information about candidates. These campaign activities have migrated and extended online. One of those activities mentioned by campaigners was fundraising. Many strategists said they were inspired by the fundraising success of the Obama campaign. “That sort of fundraising has the potential to change a campaign, so if you hit it in some parallel way, you could just spend your opponent into the ground” (Strategist F). This strategist’s party formatted their entire online campaign to enhance potential financial windfalls. Others reported record fundraising thanks to the help of soliciting donations online (Strategist C).  Another campaign function bolstered by the Internet was volunteering. All political strategists solicited volunteers online. Moreover, databanks are now housed online allowing volunteers to call voters via automated systems. This allowed campaigners to break down geographic barriers between ridings. One strategist reported that the party could use volunteers from “unwinnable” ridings to make calls in another far-flung riding where the party is competitive (Strategist C). Political strategists explained that online communications tools were also used to bolster campaign events such as the leader’s tour. Strategists talked about how messages sent out online promoted and reinforced the day-to-day announcements made by party leaders and candidates. One strategist explained, “The tour and the announcement of the day…What we put online is basically everything. There is the daily narrative of message of the day.” (Strategist C). At the same time, political strategists expressed that they have not abandoned the practice of message control and consistency during the campaign. Online messages are inline with those communicated at announcements, in news releases, and in media interviews. As one strategist summed up, Like any campaign, we developed central messaging that has been tested among our supporters and we would stick in a pretty disciplined way to that message box. The   28 worst thing obviously is being caught off message and particularly there is a huge possibility in online campaigning of one bad tweet, one bad ad, or one bad Facebook message getting picked up by the daily newspaper writers (Strategist C).  Political strategists set up careful checks on messaging that goes out online just like those in place for other media platforms. “The number one key to mitigating risk was, let’s make sure this goes past enough eyes” (Strategist E).  Similarly, the age-old campaign focus on developing the leader has been given new life online according to political strategists. Political strategists report using the Internet to market candidates and leaders in new ways. “A real marketing advantage for [candidates] and [parties] is to find any method to provide open access to personality and sincerity” (Strategist F). The Internet, and especially social media, allowed candidates to display their personalities. For example, one party encouraged the leader to Twitter about hockey to give this individual more interest in the minds of voters (Strategist C). The online media allows politicians to interact with constituents, and thus share their personalities in subtle ways, which according to strategists is one of the big challenges on the campaign. You have to define the leader and you can’t send out a release saying [the leader] is caring, but hard working. Defining a leader is much more subtle than that. The online universe could give us another dimension in terms of defining, particularly [the leader], but also to some extent candidate in terms of who they actually are (Strategist C).  Online communication appeared to be valued as an accessible and convenient way to demonstrate personality with little effort and a large potential audience. Despite all the online developments, political strategists said in the end the best way to get out the message about the platform is still face-to-face interaction. As one strategist states, “In my mind there is still no real substitute for going out there and knocking on doors, phoning people and actually engaging people directly.” Another affirms, “It’s the proven number one way of getting someone to vote for you” (Strategist A). Online tools can help campaigners organize information and volunteers, but it is still humans that elicit response. One strategist described it this way. “It’s just a matter of connecting modern technology and   29 human beings where at the end of the day there wasn’t anything magical about it. It is a volunteer talking to a voter. It’s something very traditional, but very effective” (Strategist C). 4.2.3 Interpreting the Findings Taken together, these findings leave us with a larger picture in which the online campaign described by political strategists is shaped by societal patterns as well as political norms and practices. In some ways, this picture is supportive of a social deterministic view of the technology set out by scholars like Green. For Green, society is responsible for how new technologies are adopted and implemented (Green 3). This seems consistent with how political strategists talked about why they campaigned online. The existence of the Internet did not push strategists to campaign online, instead the interview material suggests the strategists were reacting to shifting social practices. Strategists saw citizens changing their information consumption habits and thus altered their behaviour to meet that demand. Cultural forces thus seem to have played an important role in initiating online campaigning. Similarly, the idea that political culture strongly influenced campaign practices online finds support in many accounts offered by political strategists. The interview material suggests that political strategists did not deviate from the practices that define current campaign culture. This campaign culture in Canada is described by William Cross and it seems to be reflected in the ways in which strategists have applied online tools. As stated previously, Cross asserts that the main functions of political parties are electoral machines (425). The goal is to win the election, so it is unsurprising that political strategists would try to enhance their existing arsenal of tried and true election tools with the Internet’s power. In fact, that is exactly what social determinists would expect. Green states “technologies express the priorities of those who champion them” (Green 6). The goal of an election is to win and a part of that strategy is to get people involved in the political process primarily through voting, but also through volunteering, donating and attending events. Internet tools have proven   30 successful for fundraising and volunteering in the Obama campaign, which are and have been for decades, essential parts of a winning campaign. Thus, to be competitive, traditional tools must be adapted. The existing norms and practices of electioneering migrate online as another method to help achieve the ultimate goal, election. Cross’ analysis also helps to provide insight about why a focus on the leader appears to have migrated online. Cross argues the importance of party leaders in the Canadian political landscape and asserts that they dominate campaigns (Cross 76). Political strategists mentioned the Internet as a key site to develop a leader’s personality. In effect, it appears that the political culture defined by familiar campaign tools is a strong determining force for how the Internet is applied in a Canadian electoral context. However, the interview material did suggest innovation when it came to engaging and connecting with voters online, a theme that will now be discussed. 4.3 New Opportunities to Engage and Network Another theme that became evident during the interviews was that political strategists saw value in using the Internet to engage people and tap into new audiences. They expressed optimism that by disseminating messages through an interactive and networked medium, politics could be made relevant for unengaged voters. Similarly, during the course of the interviews it became evident that most political strategists acknowledged that there was a growing for new online influencers such as bloggers. The interview material suggests political strategists initially regarded the promise of the Internet in a similar way as technological determinists such as McLuhan, Levinson and Winograd and Hais. However, the results of their efforts appears to more consistent with Jodi Dean’s account of “technological fetishism”—a suggestion that is underscored by the low voter turnout in each election. This section will present the approach of political strategists to new engagement and networking opportunities including those presented by bloggers. It will conclude with an assessment of how the literature can help explain the interview material concerning these themes.   31 4.3.1 Communicating Messages in a Digital Age Many of the political strategists explained that the Internet allowed them to contextualize their policies in an attempt to make them relevant to more voters. As one strategist explained, If I don’t ever see anything that I care about, I’m never going to vote. I think it has the potential to activate more people because you can spend your time engaging, debating and getting information from political parties or special interest groups that are relevant to me (Strategist B).  The characteristics of the Internet allow political strategists to target and personalize messages for specific voters, with the hope that it will change their actions. Parties can create layers of information that provides voters with an in-depth and contextualized look at the issues as well as the candidates. As one strategist explained, If I can surround that with links and video and with other things that make it contextually-relevant, my ability to provide an idea of why the issue matters and what other areas of the economy it might impact…it starts to tell a better narrative about why the policy matters (Strategist B).  Political strategists suggest that, online, policies can be more than just long documents left up to the interpretation of journalists. Politicians are making an attempt to better explain what they are offering voters. Many political strategists discussed microsites as a key contextual tools used in the last election. Microsites are single-page websites focused on a single issue or candidate. Parties used these sites to dump video and text to help give voters more information (Strategists E, F, and G). In other cases, these sites were used to attack the issues and parties of other politicians. One party talked about cutting videos of the leader from another party with clips from their own candidates discrediting their policies (Strategist B). Another party used a microsite to publicize another leader’s political gaffes (Strategist F).  At the same time as trying to present issues in a way that make voters care, some political strategists talked about their attempts to build interactive online infrastructure that could facilitate democratic dialogue. The interviews demonstrated that most political   32 strategists had the goal of creating an interactive campaign and designing web tools that allowed feedback. As one stated, “Give them the opportunity to say something about [the platform] and actually be heard” (Strategist G). Political strategists reported voters would react to political messages and then start dialogues with their friends, more often than directing that communication back at the political party. Few strategists could provide examples of when this infrastructure actually resulted in meaningful episodes of interaction between parties and strategists. One party gave the example of the indirect feedback it received on its environmental policy (Strategist C). Instead of directing dissatisfaction to the party website or email account, voters used online websites like bcvotes.ca and nodice.com as well as Facebook and Twitter to express their views. The strategist said that these sorts of conversations, while not directed at the party, were fed back up the communication chain and affected conversations about policy and how to communicate it (Strategist C).  It also became evident that many political strategists acknowledged the power of online networks in facilitating message penetration. All of the strategists report using social networking sites to reach greater audiences. Half of the parties had formal ‘digital activism’ campaigns where supporters were identified and sent party messages to push through their social networks on Facebook, Twitter or email lists (Strategists B,C,E). These campaigns allowed political parties to direct messages at hundreds of people initially, who then could choose to forward the messages on through their social networks creating a giant multiplier effect. One party even reported implementing a Facebook application that allowed them to control supporters’ statuses (Strategist B). The strategist explained, What you are activating is all the virility of the social networking technology and using it to put messages we want people to talk about into their status…And if you and I are best friends, you opinion matters to me a lot more than somebody I read in the paper (Strategist B).  The trust relationships underpinning these connections were identified as an important component in communicating political platforms. “If I share something with my network of friends, people are more likely to perceive that story as credible. Essentially, you are creating   33 a network of validators” (Strategist C). Social networks were seen as a powerful information tool because they enabled independent validation of the political message by an individual trusted by their peers. Along with tapping into voters’ social networks, political parties also built their own. Parties found Facebook and Twitter to be a valuable tool allowing them to broadcast messages to thousand of people. 4.3.2 New Messengers in a Digital Age The networked nature of the Internet has also enabled the rise of new opinion leaders. Political strategists identified bloggers as an important site of opinion leadership. Most parties reported special outreach to bloggers including press conferences, exclusive interviews with leaders, story pitches, and even scoops (Strategists A, B, C, D,E,F). Political strategists explained that bloggers had an audience that could receive political messages. You respond because these folks are opinion leaders at some level. We know that mainstream press read his site. We know that [other parties] read his site and if he picks up on something, they can pick up on something and make it into something and it works in both directions…but at the end of the day people read them and form opinions“ (Strategists C).  The blogosphere was like a virtual coffee shop for another strategist—a place where citizens can go to hear dozens of different opinions. “These are informed Canadians, and in some cases not, that are really aware of what’s going on and they are talking about the issues” (Strategist E). Networked opinion leaders appeared to present an alternative to the top-down opinion leaders in traditional media. Strategists acknowledged the fact that organic technology like the Internet facilitates dialogue and has the potential to impact political opinions. A further benefit of targeting new opinion leaders mentioned by several political strategists was bypassing media gatekeepers and using bloggers to set the public agenda. As one strategist stated, “We use the Internet to communicate our message and we hope that our message is what voters think is important” (Strategist G). The online activism described   34 by political strategists is another example. Party faithful sent out policy and campaign messages through Facebook pages, MySpace, YouTube, Twitter and e-mail prompting people to think about the issues the party was campaigning on. It is important to note here that the strategists maintained that journalists exercise more influence over voters and thus command more attention. “We have a pretty good idea of what happens when there is an article in the Vancouver Sun or a story on Global, but when a blogger with a readership of 5,000 publishes something, we don’t know how it affects the electorate” (Strategist C). Political strategists identify mainstream media as the main source of political information for voters. In the words of one strategist, “Bloggers aren’t taken seriously because they don’t have the reach” (Strategist A). Another compared the reach to traditional media. At the end of the day, most of what is published on the Vancouver Sun still is published in the paper and they send out thousands of copies a day. I am not going to pretend there is a blogger with a readership remotely approaching a Sun columnist (Strategist C).  Because of the limited reach of bloggers and the established audience for mainstream media, journalists appeared to remain the focus for strategists. Political strategists reported that only 10-20 per cent of effort was spent doing online campaigning, compared to the 80-90 per cent effort expended on traditional campaigning including mainstream media outreach. 4.3.3  Bringing the Online World Offline Key to understanding these actions is an examination of how political strategists talked about the goals of online messaging. Many political strategists seemed confident that these messages and attempts at engagement would have an offline effect. In the words of one strategist: Use the online to penetrate. Use the online to create discussion. And then transition into real collaboration…What we did was try to engage all along through stuff like Facebook advertising…And then we would say, we are having a meeting, would you like to come (Strategist E)?    35 Another political strategist expressed this optimism in a similar fashion. “[The] goal was that when you contacted them online…their goal was to convert you to a donor and more importantly to a volunteer in the real world, not the online world (Strategist C).” While some political strategists appeared confident about their ability to translate online action into real life action. Another was more critical about the success of the party’s attempts. “For us, most of what’s online stays online. It doesn’t turn into real life connections which is something [Obama] has been able to do quite well in the States” [Strategist D]. This scepticism is born out in the actual results of the election campaign. Voter turnout in the federal and provincial levels hit record lows, while voter turnout in the municipal election was the lowest since 1942. 4.3.4 Interpreting the Findings This section has laid out the new ways that political strategists indicated they were communicating with voters thanks to the Internet. It has also revealed how they talked about the goals of the messaging. It found that political strategists saw value in using the Internet to engage people and tap into new audiences, but that those efforts were not reflected in the electoral outcome. In many ways, these findings suggest political strategists initially regarded the promise of the Internet in a similar way as technological determinists. The characteristics of the Internet as a technology—interactivity, networked and personal—were seen to have the potential to change the political behaviour of voters in the real world. Thus, the technology would touch and transform every part of citizens’ lives, including the political, as posited by Marshall McLuhan (Littlejohn 267). There seems to be some belief, on behalf of some strategists, that the Internet would exponentially multiply the numbers of messages and activate users as outlined by Paul Levinson (38). However, clearly the rates of voter turnout were not consistent with a view of an all-powerful technological force. This leads us to look to the mitigating role of political culture. Jodi Dean’s account of “technological fetishism” appears more consistent with the electoral results and can help   36 explain the divergence. Dean’s theory sets out the idea that technology creates a “fantasy of participation” (60). Essentially, Dean asserts that real life political action is being replaced by Internet activity (60). As Dean describes, People believe that their contribution to circulating content is a kind of communication action. They believe that they are active, maybe even that they are making a difference simply by clicking on a button, adding their name to a petition or commenting on a blog (60).  Instead of actually having a real impact, online action is used as a “fetish” while other forces replace citizens offline (Dean 60). Dean argues this action is depoliticizing because people struggle for their political goals online replacing the real life achievement of these goals and securing the sphere of official politics for the powerful (61). The working of such a fantasy is clear in discussions of the political impact of a new device, system, code or platform. A particular technological innovation becomes a screen upon which all sorts of fantasies of political action are projected (Dean 62).  Thus, the Internet has become a realm in which citizens project their fantasies of political action replacing real world action including voting. This could help explain why even if there is increasing activity online, it did not translate into action in the real world. Dean’s work also helps elucidate the relationship, or lack thereof, between messaging and democratic action. Dean makes it clear that penetrating messaging will not necessarily inspire political action from citizens, but in fact do the opposite. It is clear that political strategists increased the number of messages they were sending during the campaign including information about political parties, their policies and their candidates. The amount of information available is often theorized as a democratic good in and of itself. Even Michael Schudson who is critical about the power of information technology to change democracy states, “A more informed citizenry will create a better and fuller democracy” (Schudson 205). The Internet has exponentially increased the amount of information available to citizens and has presented it in new formats that are easier to understand. However, while this type of   37 communication may be necessary, it is not sufficient for democracy. Dean would argue that the ability of politicians to send messages online just reinforces their views at the expensive of soliciting true, two-way communication (Dean 63). The interview material indicates that there has been a multiplication of messages flowing from politicians to citizens without a reciprocal flow back from citizens. This multiplication of one-way messages is not simply a function of technology, although technology enables it. It is reflective of the power relationships between political parties and citizens. Similarly, it is important to consider how political psychology interacts with and mitigates the power of the Internet. While the interview material suggests that the Internet has enhanced the information available, there is little evidence that it increases the size of the audience seeking it out. Microsites may exist, but citizens have to find them. Videos might be posted on YouTube, but potential voters have to search for them. Politicians might be on Twitter, but citizens have to be following them. Some citizens will take action to find these new information sources, however, political psychology informs us that that segment is small (Bimber 149). Bruce Bimber argues that voters will choose to read online only what they are interested in, political or not (Bimber 149). As Bimber quotes Curtis Gans in his book Campaigning Online: The Internet in U.S. Elections: “While candidates…may design the most complete sources of information and the most compelling presentations of that information, what they cannot do is provide the motivation to access those sites” (Bimber 153). The political strategists interviewed expressed similar concerns about the true reach of the Internet. “We are still talking, in terms of the people we are reaching, about our base and the people who are still paying attention anyways. There’s still the problem of disengaged, disenfranchised voters (Strategist D).” Another strategist labelled the problem as one of hyper-engagement. “[The Internet] has become a disengagement rather than engagement tool. It’s become a fragmented engagement tool where there can be hyper-engagement among fragmented groups. They become quite an echo-chamber (Strategist A).”   38 The idea that political culture plays a leading role in determining the shape of an online campaign also sheds light onto the findings concerning the power of bloggers. The focus on mainstream media reflects its place in current political culture. According to work done by Fred Fletcher and Mary Lynn Young, 54.1 per cent of voters report getting their information from television, 19.1 per cent receive political information from newspapers and 8.1 per cent get information about politics from radio (Fletcher and Young 11). In contrast, only 7.1 per cent of voters get the majority of their political information online (Fletcher and Young 11). The Internet cannot provide a mass, captive audience; instead, citizens have to seek out information online (Bimber and Davis 147). Moreover, Bimber argues that even if citizens do look for information online, it still may not be as effective as mass media encounters because of “voter selectivity” that is the tendency for people to seek out sources of information that confirm their existing beliefs (Bimber and Davis 148-149). Thus, reader habits online seem to be inline with political culture and the Internet simply enables readers with more fragmented information. Now that this paper has presented the findings concerning how the Internet has affected the communication of the campaign platform, I will turn to its impacts, or lack thereof, on the platform-building process. 4.4 Few Opportunities to Impact Policy While many strategists listed tapping new audiences and engaging more people as important goals of the campaign, eliciting feedback on policy issues was not discussed as an appropriate online activity. The interview material indicated that strategists did not use the online campaign and the feedback it elicited to shape party policy, specifically the campaign platform. Rather, strategists explained that professionalized tools such as polling were the most trusted pictures of public opinion. This material presents a picture of a campaign that is still driven by professionals rather than citizens when it comes to determining the issues—an observation that seems consistent with the literature about political norms and practices   39 around platform-building as laid out by theorists such as Cross and Lees-Marshment. Again, the interviews appear consistent with the view that political culture plays a mitigating role in the power of technology to force political change. This section will present how political strategists assessed the Internet’s value in platform-building and reflecting public opinion on issues. It concludes with an examination of how the literature can help explain the interview material concerning these themes. 4.4.1 A Professionalized Platform-Building Process It is assumed that a democratic government will create public policy that reflects the will of the people. During an election, policy is contained in the campaign platform, which sets out a party’s planned actions if they form a government. While traditionally, platform-building has been an activity relegated to the realm of party members or the backrooms of political strategists, the Internet provides the opportunity to open up the process to more participants. However, the majority of the strategists interviewed described a highly professionalized and/or party-focused platform-building procedure. Political strategists identified public opinion research, party conventions or the goals of party leaders as the main sources of campaign policy. As one strategist stated, “You are not going to just create a platform on a bunch of stuff people send you. It has got to be strategic to get votes. People that send stuff in aren’t going to be strategic thinkers” (Strategist C). Another expressed, “It’s not some big collaborative effort that everybody things it is” (Strategist A). Half of the parties explicitly mentioned that they valued the Internet’s ability to allow direct feedback from citizens. During the campaign however, none of the party strategists could name a specific instance where feedback changed the course of a party’s platform. The most-commonly cited feedback was positive affirmation, which was indicated by an approving email or a “thumb’s up” on Facebook.   40 The nature of the Internet has also lead some writers (Morris 1999, Winograd and Hais 2008) to believe that online communications would be a key site for the expression of public opinion. The value political strategists placed on public opinion for platform-building came out through many of the interviews; however, strategists explained that the Internet was not an accurate gauge of public opinion. The Internet provides raw, unfiltered comments and concerns from citizens, but according to most of the strategists, it does not allow for the scientific accuracy or representativeness desired by political parties when drafting the campaign platform. As one strategist explained, I always tell [elected members] that many anecdotes do not comprise data. At the end of the day, 20 people calling your office, while it may seem significant, it is still just 20 people, when you represent 60,000. You want repeatable, verifiable results…. If parties wrote policy based on even just the correspondence they got, it could really mean neglecting a vast majority of the voters (Strategist C).  The Internet is not seen as an accurate source for policy-informing public opinion, however, half of those interviewed said they believed informal online “heat maps” of public opinion could play a complementary role to scientific public opinion polling in future campaigns. There were two exceptions to the findings presented above, representing some new innovations in platform-building in the lead-up to the election. One of these parties did have a small, informal online forum to discuss policy, but ultimately the political strategist reported that party membership created the platform (Strategist D). Moreover, one party did use the Internet to open up its platform-building process in advance of the election.2 This party hosted a website where voters could submit their ideas for future government action. The official rhetoric surrounding the efforts clearly espoused the idea that the campaign platform was an essential opportunity to hear from citizens. As the website reads, “Elections are a time for parties to lay out their plan for the future of the province. But plans are created by people sharing their ideas and being clear about their priorities for their province…we launched [this initiative] to give all [citizens] a new forum to  2 This finding has been brought in separately from the interview process. Its inclusion does not necessarily indicate the inclusion of the quoted party in the pool of interviewees.   41 share their views on the issues facing our province, their input on the progress we are making together and the path they would choose to the future” (BC Liberals 2009).  The website was open to all members of the public and it solicited 1,500 submissions that helped inform the platform. The website was complemented by a digital van that travelled across the province and solicited input from voters about issues they believed were important and complementary policy ideas. While the process was open in the lead-up to the campaign, party strategists decided on the final content of the platform. 4.4.2 Interpreting the Findings The research findings shed light on the research question concerning the impact of the Internet on the development of the campaign platform. The Internet’s potential as a channel for citizen input into election campaigns has not lived up to the optimism of technological determinists such as Winograd and Hais or scholars like Rowland who believe networked technologies have the characteristics needed to strengthen democracy by giving people a voice in policy decisions. The findings suggest that, in most cases, online communication had little impact on the development of the campaign platform in the three elections studied. Instead, there was a measure of distrust in the scientific value of online communications as a gauge of public opinion and electoral direction. Anecdotes do not comprise data, tweets do not make public opinion and Facebook groups are not focus groups. While there are more opportunities for a greater number of voices to be heard online, there is not a trusted, scientific way to gauge what the opinions mean. The literature on political campaigns and the primacy of political marketing can help us understand why political strategists have been hesitant to use online communication to inform campaign platforms. The activities surrounding platform-building described by political strategists seems to be in line with established academic accounts of political norms and practices. The framework of political marketing set out by Jennifer Lees-Marshment highlights   42 the use of public opinion research to decide the appropriate policies to include in a political platform. Political marketing is about political organizations adapting techniques (such as market research) and concepts (such as market orientation to satisfy user demands) originally used in the business world to help the organizations achieve their goals (Lees-Marshment 9).  Everything is professionalized and starts with the practice of market research, which occurs well before the campaign (Lees-Marshment 18). This market research includes polling, public opinion research and focus groups and is meant to design a product (read policies) that appeals to voters during the campaign. This is not surprising as extensive literature examines the professionalization of politics and the rise in the role of political consultants. Other studies have focused on the primacy of political consultants in determining policy areas of focus based on research with focus groups (Johnson 107). Understanding is further bolstered by the way this professionalization fits with Cross’ assessment of our political culture. Cross explains that our electoral system does not incorporate room for policy-making, which instead happens between elections by parliamentary members (426). This process of political marketing is similar to the one laid out by political strategists. They undertake market research in the months leading up to the campaign and create a platform based on that information. As a result, the Internet seems more like a place to promote the finished product than a place to develop it during an election campaign. In effect, these findings demonstrate how the practices and tools of current political culture still seem to be preeminent despite new technology that provides new sources of information. Of course, there was one exception borne out in the open platform process of one party, but for the most part, we are still witnessing political parties maintaining closed policy-making process despite changes new technologies offer.   43 5. CONCLUSION The results of this study shed interesting light onto the question about how online communication tools affect the development and communication of the campaign platform in Canadian elections. The findings suggest that the Internet, while a promising new tool, online campaign strategies were largely reactionary and represented migrations of traditional campaign tools onto a new platform. There were indications that political strategists are both making and taking new opportunities to extend the reach of their messaging and engage more people with those messages by tapping into networks, building interactive infrastructure and interacting with online influencers. The Internet allows political parties to get their messages out to more people through networks, as well as allowing them more space to contextualize their policies. This change has the potential to allow for a strengthened dialogue between voters and political parties. However, the research suggests that these efforts had more of an effect in terms of broadcasting than engagement. Similarly, online communications have yet to make inroads in terms of shaping the campaign platform. Political strategists still report relying on traditional means of testing political will including polling and public opinion research in an attempt to build the winning platform. The theoretical framework outlined at the beginning of this report helps make sense of the themes uncovered in this research. The findings suggest the Internet is not a benign force, but it is not the defining variable of online campaigns. However, it can be argued that the Internet’s impact on the development and communication of the campaign platform is mitigated by existing society, especially the established norms and practices of political culture. Political culture, and the norms and practices it entails, appears to be the key force in determining how online campaigning takes shape in Canada. The interview materials suggest politicians followed broader social trends when deciding to launch an online campaign and   44 refurbished established campaigning practices. Even attempts at innovation including interactive messaging, the use of social networks and the rise of bloggers seem to be limited in their impact due to the effects of “technological fetishism” (Dean 60) and “voter selectivity” (Bimber 148). Finally, the professionalized culture of the platform-building process staved off the participatory potential of the Internet. To a substantial extent, these results point to the influence of political culture in determining how the Internet is applied in Canada. Thus, the theoretical framework informed by social constructivist academics Bimber, Dean and Schudson as well as political theorists Cross and Lees-Marshment help make sense of these research findings by setting out the possibility that technology must interact with and thus is shaped by existing cultural forces. This paper presents a first look at how Canadian political parties are using and responding to online communication tools during elections campaigns, but it also provides direction for several other areas for future study. The Internet has moved to the core of contemporary political communications and should command greater academic attention. A promising area for future research will be opportunities for influencing the policy, especially the development of the campaign platform, between elections. This research made it clear that the time to influence policy is between elections. Future study should be watchful for openings the Internet could facilitate in this process. Currently, one political party in Canada seems to be experimenting with a more open process of setting priorities. Canada @ 150 was the Liberal Party of Canada’s 2010 policy conference. The conference was an exclusive event, with a $700 per person price tag. However, the party tried to open up the process by streaming the conference proceedings online, and many constituency offices were transformed into theatres for interested citizens. Citizens could also use Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to contribute ideas or questions to the conference. This conference is only a first step towards creating policy, but it seems to represent a more open process, facilitated in part by the Internet.   45 Another important area for study will remain whether or not the current model of broadcasting and political marketing shifts over time and political strategists experiment and learn how to facilitate a greater flow of two-way dialogue. Moreover, will this two-way dialogue engage a greater diversity of people; that is those citizens who are not already previously engaged. Canada @ 150 might be a good place to start examining these questions because it is a small sample of people. It will also be interesting to see whether online communication will lead to greater fragmentation. As part of studying the potential for growth in two-way online dialogue between political parties and the citizens they seek to represent, more study should be directed towards studying barriers to Internet campaigning in the Canadian context. According to the political strategists interviewed, these barriers include spending limits, privacy laws, small audiences and a small pool of influential online personalities.  A final question that should be explored in future research is how much pressure we should put on the media and technology to renew political engagement. Focusing too strongly on what can be done to make information technologies a force for democracy may blind researchers, policy makers and citizens to other aspects of the electoral system and political culture that need to change. Information and information technology certainly have a role to play in connecting people with politicians and policy issues, however it is unreasonable to consider new applications of media and discourse as a panacea for declining interest in the political system. There are other reforms that could work in tandem with more responsive and dialogue-oriented political communication. For example, it might not be enough for people to see their pet issue discussed on Twitter. Perhaps, a better way to make people feel relevant and listened to is electoral reform, open policy processes, candidates that are more relevant or a decline in negative campaigning.   46 6.

His knowledge of Southeast Asia has been invaluable, particularly in shaping the analytical portion of this project.      vii Dedication  This thesis is dedicated to my family and friends who offered me their ideas when I had none of my own, their encouragement when things went wrong, and their ears even when they had no idea what I was going on about.   1 1.0 Introduction  Saturation coverage tends to shine a spotlight on select events for a brief period of time before moving on to another event, which then becomes the focus of a great deal of attention. When media coverage of a natural disaster dwindles, public attention also tends to shift to other issues. This can have an impact on both private donations for humanitarian relief efforts, as well as the pressures put on governments to offer official aid packages to afflicted states (CARMA 9). Using three Canadian newspapers’ coverage of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami as a case study, this study seeks to answer three questions: 1. How does media coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 2. Why does coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 3. What patterns, if any, exist in disaster reporting across media organizations? 1.1 Rationale  With the changing climate, people around the world face the threat of natural disasters that are increasingly frequent, as well as increasingly devastating (Schneider 789). Bearing this in mind, how natural disasters are covered in the media should be re-evaluated and how decisions about covering these catastrophic events are made should be studied. Journalists have a responsibility to act in the public interest and must understand that this responsibility extends not only to their audiences, but also to those whose hardships and suffering they report on. There is already debate over how long natural disasters should remain on the news agenda, and journalists’ responsibility for keeping such stories there. Some argue it is inevitable that the news agenda will move on, and journalists have a responsibility to allow this to happen (International Correspondents, CNN). Others argue that the news agenda evolves through the decisions journalists and others in the media business make about what they will cover (International Correspondents, CNN). There are no easy answers to questions of how long stories   2 about even the most devastating natural disasters should remain on the news agenda. However, having a clearer understanding of the impact coverage can have on relief and recovery efforts will add a new dimension to the debate. There are also concerns that continuing coverage of natural disasters and the suffering they inflict on affected populations will lead to “concern fatigue,” also referred to in the literature as “compassion fatigue.” Here, the argument is that even if journalists continue to devote time to covering natural disasters over the long term, their audiences will lose interest in the topic (Robertson 8). Interest can be maintained for a longer period of time by covering natural disasters and their aftermath from new angles; however, it is unclear whether this approach also leads to concern fatigue. Based on Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge’s analysis of foreign news values, natural disasters that occur abroad are attractive options for the media to report on for two reasons: first, they evolve suddenly and often without warning, and second, they are unambiguous (Franks 283). Galtung and Ruge argue that it is straightforward, rather than complex events that tend to make international headlines, as audiences often lack the interest needed to make an effort to understand more complex foreign events (Galtung and Ruge 66). In light of this, natural disasters are an easy fill for time or space that media organizations set aside for international news.    3 2.0 Literature Review   Case studies published in academic journals across disciplines have analyzed media coverage of foreign events – including natural disasters that occur overseas – and compared coverage of different events and disasters in foreign media. While these case studies offer thorough explanations of what factors drive foreign events to become foreign news, answers as to why these events are covered as they are by foreign media are harder to come by.  This literature review will explore both the why and the how of foreign events becoming foreign news. As it is also the topic of this thesis project, this review will use the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami as a case study to test the ideas put forward by various academics, identify gaps in the existing literature and recommend areas for further investigation. 2.1 What Made the Tsunami “News”?  A number of scholars have studied international news, searching for explanations of why some events taking place around the world get picked up by foreign media while others go unreported. Since the 1960s, much of this work has made reference to Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge’s study on foreign news values, which is considered a seminal piece in the field. In their study, Galtung and Ruge considered three case studies of foreign events that made their way into Western news coverage and, after careful analysis, hypothesized a list of criteria that must be met before “foreign events” become “foreign news.” They also found that foreign news values should be consistent across different cultures (Galtung and Ruge 68). As such, the values emerging from their studies of Norwegian newspapers should be applicable to the Canadian context.  Galtung and Ruge produced a long and extremely detailed list of hypotheses that account for factors such as a country’s standing in the international community, the social standing of the people involved in or affected by an event, and the type of event (positive or negative) in   4 considering which events are likely to be picked up and reported as foreign news. The hypotheses that are of greatest relevance to this thesis include the following: • An event with a clear interpretation, free from ambiguity in its meaning, is preferred to the highly ambiguous event from which many and inconsistent implications can and will be made (Galtung and Ruge 66); • An event that takes place over a longer time span will go unrecorded unless it reaches some kind of dramatic climax, but events that are rare or unexpected have the greatest chance of making foreign news (Galtung and Ruge 67); • Once something has hit the headlines and been defined as news, it will continue to be defined as news for some time (Galtung and Ruge 67); • News from culturally distant or low rank countries will have to refer to people, preferably top elite, and be preferably negative and unexpected (Galtung and Ruge 84); and • News from culturally distant or low rank countries will also have to be simple and should, if possible, provide the reader with some sense of identification, such as a reference to the reader’s nation or group of nations (Galtung and Ruge 84). More than 40 years after Galtung and Ruge first published their study on foreign news values, scholars still tend to base their analyses on values suggested by Galtung and Ruge. Much of the literature employs these foreign news values in explaining why natural disasters like the 2004 tsunami make news abroad, citing the fact that they happen suddenly, require little explanation or contextualization, and tend to produce negative narratives. However, the literature offering a critical analysis of Galtung and Ruge’s hypotheses is underdeveloped, particularly in light of the changes the world has experienced since the 1960s. Although some scholars have examined news values associated with foreign natural disasters on a small scale (i.e. comparing and contrasting coverage of a handful of disasters), a comprehensive study of foreign news values in the new millennium has yet to be conducted.   5 Given the drastic changes that the media and society as a whole have experienced, this absence of new studies is problematic. In the Internet age, Jens Jensen argues, newspapers can publish virtually unlimited video and audio content online, and give site visitors access to hundreds of photos. According to Jensen, the birth of online journalism and the advent of participatory or citizen journalism have dramatically changed the media landscape, allowing citizens to start covering breaking stories before news organizations arrive on scene. In short, the Internet has wrought dramatic changes that Galtung and Ruge’s work could not foresee. For this reason, this literature review will consider Galtung and Ruge’s main hypotheses in light of the media environment in the 21st century, as well as other scholars’ work on the media, disaster reporting and media coverage of the 2004 tsunami. At first glance, there appears to be some inconsistency in Galtung and Ruge’s analysis of foreign news values. Natural disasters, including tsunamis, tend to strike suddenly, which Galtung and Ruge found to increase the likelihood of these events being covered as foreign news. However they are not uncommon. Each year an average of 60,000 people globally are killed by natural disasters, and another quarter of a billion people are otherwise impacted (Downman 4). According to Galtung and Ruge’s hypothesis, the routinization of deaths caused by natural disasters should decrease the likelihood of foreign media covering these stories. However, regular reading of a daily newspaper or viewing of a nightly newscast will quickly lead one to conclude that natural disasters overseas are often covered as international news. This may reflect a subtle shift in foreign news values since Galtung and Ruge first proposed their hypotheses. As technology has advanced, making it easier for news organizations to report on events abroad and for scientists to predict some types of disasters (i.e. hurricanes), the threshold a disaster must cross in order to become newsworthy may have changed. It may be that it is no longer the rarity of the disaster itself that determines its news value, but rather, the rarity of its impact. This is suggested in Philip Brown and Jessica Minty’s study of the   6 relationship between media coverage and charitable giving after the Asian tsunami. According to Brown and Minty, United Nations (UN) records counted more than a quarter of a million people killed or reported missing after the tsunami, making the scope of the disaster rather than the disaster itself a rare event (5). Based on Galtung and Ruge’s analysis of foreign news values, sweeping victims from the shores of 14 countries guaranteed the tsunami would be mentioned in most major news organizations’ coverage of world events. What Galtung and Ruge struggle to offer is a satisfactory hypothesis for the quantity of coverage devoted to a foreign news event. Their assertion that once an event has been defined as news, it will continue to be defined as news is generally accepted by other scholars as true, however the hypothesis does not adequately explain why foreign media initially devoted so much coverage to the tsunami. After the tsunami, CNN alone deployed more than 80 anchors, correspondents and producers to Southeast Asia in order to provide round-the-clock coverage of the disaster (Brown and Minty 5). In their analysis of foreign news values, Galtung and Ruge seem to have overlooked what most scholars recognize as a core news value in any type of reporting: timing. When the tsunami struck on December 26th, 2004, many governments around the world were in recess and most major corporations were operating at reduced capacity over the holiday period. Due to the timing of the disaster, the tsunami faced considerably less competition for limited column inches and broadcast time than it would at virtually any other time of year. Galtung and Ruge’s hypotheses on foreign news values also, in large part, fail to explain the duration of the media’s tsunami coverage. One study of American media coverage found that peaks in tsunami coverage occurred on December 30th, 2004 and January 4th, February 1st, February 19th, March 8th, March 26th and March 28th, 2005 (Brown and Minty 6). The duration of this coverage is unusual and cannot be explained by Galtung and Ruge’s analysis. To understand   7 why the media continued to devote so much coverage to the tsunami throughout the post-disaster recovery period, one must consider Peter Vasterman’s work on so-called “media-hype.” In a 2005 study, Vasterman noted the existence of “positive feedback loops,” in which the media begins by offering regular news coverage of an event, during which journalists report facts and offer analysis. After a while, the event or topic is seen as less newsworthy and media attention will diminish and start to shift elsewhere. However, there are some events, such as the tsunami, which prompt media coverage to continue independent of how stories are (or are not) unfolding. When this occurs, Vasterman argues, a theme begins to develop in news coverage and the threshold of newsworthiness is lowered for events and stories that can be tied to that theme. Even after coverage of a theme has gone into decline, the threshold for newsworthiness remains lowered, allowing for coverage to extend even further (Vasterman 515). However, though Vasterman’s work offers an explanation for the duration of tsunami coverage by foreign media, his analysis does not explain the peaks in coverage that occurred through March 2005 – three months after the tsunami struck. For that, one must return to Galtung and Ruge’s study of foreign news values. Galtung and Ruge posited that news from countries that are culturally distant or of low rank in the international community must refer to elites, be negative or unexpected, or allow an audience to identify with the story. This hypothesis was proven to hold true some 40 years later when a study by Brown and Minty identified peaks in tsunami coverage and cross-referenced those peaks with events happening at the time. With the exception of the March 26th peak – which resulted from media organizations commemorating the three-month anniversary of the disaster – Galtung and Ruge’s hypotheses account for every peak found in American coverage of the tsunami. On December 30th, 2004, American donations to relief efforts were reaching unprecedented levels and were expected to climb further after the federal Tsunami Disaster and Tax Relief Act extended the deadline for   8 tax-deductible charitable donations from the traditional December 31st deadline through until January 31st (Brown and Minty 6). Americans’ unexpected outpouring of generosity generated numerous stories, boosting the amount of coverage devoted to tsunami-related stories. Unexpected events also account for the March 28th peak, when American media reported on an 8.7 magnitude earthquake that shook the area near the epicenter of the earthquake responsible for causing the Boxing Day tsunami. Meanwhile, elites were tied to peaks on January 4th (when Secretary of State Colin Powell visited affected areas), February 1st (when former President Bill Clinton was appointed as a special American envoy to South Asia), and March 8th (when Clinton and former President George H.W. Bush briefed President George W. Bush on the disaster). Finally, the February 19th peak coincided with the publication of vacation photos taken by a Canadian couple that died in the tsunami – victims that an American audience could identify with in terms of both culture and geography (Brown and Minty 6). Overall, many of the hypotheses about foreign news values that Galtung and Ruge first proposed in 1965 still appear to apply more than 40 years later. That is not to say, however, that scholars should wait another 40 years before re-examining foreign news values. Although there is evidence to support the continuing validity of Galtung and Ruge’s work, a more comprehensive study is still necessary to understand how a more mobile global population, the Internet, citizen journalism and other realities of the 21st century have impacted modern foreign news values. This thesis project will examine the quantity and duration of coverage, and the threshold for “newsworthy” stories in the Canadian print media’s coverage of the 2004 tsunami. However, more general analyses of foreign news values and the role of the Internet in tsunami coverage are beyond the scope of this project.     9 2.2 What Factors Shaped News Coverage of the Tsunami?  How the media covers an event is as important as what the media chooses to cover. However, in some instances – for example, immediately after a natural disaster – how media organizations operate inside the disaster zone may actually be more important than the stories they pursue. This, arguably, may be doubly so in the case of a foreign media organization covering a natural disaster. In a 1997 study, Penelope Ploughman analyzed newspaper coverage of seven disasters – both natural and technological (man-made) – and found the common belief that, “disasters provoke widespread community breakdown, including panic, flight, looting, psychological dependency and shock,” is not rooted in fact (121). Rather, Ploughman concluded, “rationality and altruism tend to prevail and most [people] respond in ways designed to restore normality” (121). However the media, she concluded, generally does not. The situations tsunami-affected states encountered as foreign journalists streamed into the disaster zone after the tsunami lend support to Ploughman’s findings. In a presentation to the 2005 Journalism Education Conference at Griffith University, Scott Downman stated that many media organizations do not have clear policies on covering natural disasters abroad. Moreover, Downman noted, relatively inexperienced crews are often dispatched to report on foreign disasters before questions about what they will eat, where they will sleep and how they will file stories can be answered (4). An influx of foreign journalists ill- prepared to function independently in a post-disaster environment can add to the demand for scarce basic resources like food, safe drinking water, shelter and medical care, as well as luxuries like electricity and telephone access that may be vital to rescue and recovery efforts (Downman 4). This, Downman concluded, was the case in much of Southeast Asia and especially the Indonesian city of Banda Aceh in the days and weeks following the disaster.   10 After the tsunami, organizations like the International News Safety Institute (INSI) issued guidelines for journalists headed to affected areas. The INSI recommendations were straightforward, and included such common sense suggestions as all journalists ensuring their vaccinations were up-to-date and that they traveled with a first aid kit complete with sterile needles, insect repellant, painkillers, and basic antibiotics. But Downman’s study found that many journalists arrived in Banda Aceh without clean food or water, money, laptops or satellite phones and without local language skills or a translator (9). In fact, he reported that some arrived with only a credit card, expecting to purchase the necessary supplies inside the disaster zone (Downman 9). Many of those journalists who arrived unprepared became dependent on aid agencies for basic supplies and scrounged the resources needed to file stories from local media organizations, many of which had been devastated by the tsunami (Downman 13). Ultimately, Downman concluded that the presence of so many journalists in devastated areas – especially Indonesia’s Banda Aceh – hindered relief efforts. Downman attributes the phenomenon of journalists flocking to Southeast Asia, unprepared for the conditions they would have to operate in, to the fact that many affected areas were easily accessible to journalists. That is, these areas were geographically close to places where many journalists were already stationed to cover foreign news, and flights into the disaster zone were relatively cheap (Downman 5). However, this conclusion fails to explain why a handful of organizations, such as Reuters – a world renowned news organization with journalists permanently stationed around the globe – adhered to their existing policies, insisting that all their journalists traveling to the disaster zone complete an extensive training course on how to be self- sufficient in the field prior to departure (Downman 11). Downman’s findings fail to take into consideration how the foreign reporting experience and reputations of the news organizations represented by journalists traveling to a disaster zone might impact the area. His findings also   11 leave the question of why so many foreign journalists traveled to tsunami-affected areas unanswered. Alternate explanations also fail to provide satisfactory answers. In a 1998 study of television news coverage of disasters, Tamar Liebes posited that media organizations can resist participating in marathon-length coverage of a natural disaster (73). However, he determined that professional norms, journalists’ perceptions about their roles in democratic society, and the economic pressures on decision makers in the newsroom have a tendency to pressure journalists into devoting a great deal of coverage to natural disasters (Liebes 73). In a more recent study of media-hype across mediums, Vasterman offered a similar explanation, noting that editors are pressured to report on any number of events because their competition is doing so, because there may be consequences or implications for important public figures, or – as was the case after the tsunami – because the news wave of related stories is itself a story (509). As the other two factors have already been discussed elsewhere in this literature review, the potential impact a story may have on public figures will be considered here. Not long after the tsunami struck, coverage of the humanitarian side of the disaster started decreasing and some media organizations began running stories that focused on the impact decisions related to tsunami relief and recovery would have on politicians not in affected areas, but in the West. For example, in early January, one Canadian newspaper reported on a CNN prediction that, “the [George W.] Bush administration’s efforts to stop the growth of Islamic terrorist organizations in Southeast Asia would suffer a setback because shadowy terrorist groups would use the chaos and confusion to further their nefarious ends” (Doyle R2). Just two days later, the same paper ran a story about the balancing act Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin was performing by offering aid money to Sri Lanka while insisting that none of this money was reaching the Tamil Tigers, a group recognized as a terrorist organization by the UN and some of Canada’s allies (Wong and Campbell A1). Both the Bush and Martin governments   12 were left in difficult positions after the tsunami, as were countless other public figures whose decisions about relief and recovery efforts in Southeast Asia may potentially have had serious implications for the survival of affected people, as well as terrorism and ongoing conflict in the region. These dilemmas, and their potential consequences in future elections, may explain why there was so much media coverage of Western governments’ responses to the tsunami. However, while these circumstances may explain why journalists flocked to cover the tsunami, they still do not adequately explain why foreign journalists flocked to Southeast Asia. Evidently, there is still analysis that must be done on this topic, as the existing literature falls short of offering satisfactory answers. The Western focus of much foreign reporting on the tsunami raises another interesting question, namely why so many Western politicians fed the news cycle with tsunami-related stories. A 2006 report by the global media analysis firm CARMA International analyzing media coverage of six natural and humanitarian disasters, including the Southeast Asian tsunami, may offer some insight into this. CARMA International found that the amount of coverage devoted to a humanitarian disaster is, in fact, tied to the political capital – such as voter support at home or support for an initiative to be presented to the international community – to be gained from the disaster (9). From a political perspective, the organization identified two uses that humanitarian disasters may be put to: the disaster can either be used to fuel an ongoing debate (the “grist to the mill” approach) or used to serve the national interest (the “strategic” approach) (CARMA 9). In the grist to the mill approach, CARMA found that both the media and politicians downplay the humanitarian dimensions of a crisis, and the focus is instead shifted to the political arguments being made (9). This claim is supported by the content analysis conducted for this thesis project, which found that Canadian newspapers focused on the humanitarian aspect of the disaster immediately following the tsunami, but soon began shifting their tsunami coverage to focus on more contentious issues, such as aid and recovery.   13 Under CARMA’s criteria, this would indicate that coverage of the tsunami performed a strategic rather than persuasive function in Canada. This strategic function may explain why so many politicians made themselves available to the media for post-tsunami stories: politicians are able to drive coverage of a disaster, but they will only do so in order to serve their own interests (CARMA 7). But what interest did politicians have in perpetuating the flood of tsunami-related stories? Vasterman’s media-hype study offers an answer: an expansion of the definition of a problem, resulting in the broadening of the scope of a problem as news organizations engage in thematic reporting (517). In some post-tsunami reporting, however, the theme was not the tsunami, as one might expect. Rather terrorism – a theme of much greater and longer lasting interest to Western politicians since the September 11th attacks – was being re-visited by the media. While Vasterman and CARMA can explain why a steady flow of public figures were willing to speak to the media to push their political agendas on other issues in the wake of the tsunami, neither study explains why the media chose to run terrorism-themed stories. To understand that, one must return to Ploughman’s study of the credibility hierarchy after a disaster. As other scholars have noted, Ploughman found that patterns in the distribution of social power and prestige are reflected in the selection of what is news. These patterns create a so-called credibility hierarchy, in which credibility is defined as both the right to be heard and the perceived importance of the view being expressed (Ploughman 119). According to Ploughman, the government is usually the dominant newsmaker after a disaster, largely because it has control over information about the disaster, as well as relief and recovery efforts, and because it has so many resources at its disposal in terms of manpower, expert knowledge and equipment (119). After examining media coverage of seven different disasters, Ploughman concluded that in disaster reporting, the media relies upon the established credibility hierarchy, particularly governments from their places at the top of the hierarchy, to determine the salience   14 of issues and set the agenda for social and political discourse on those issues (120). To date, there has been little written about citizen journalism’s place in this hierarchy, or its impact. Clearly scholars have found many factors that work together to shape media coverage of an event. But many questions remain unanswered in the existing literature. Further research is needed to explore issues such as whether reporting on individual natural disasters is itself part of a broader theme, such as climate change, if these broader themes determine which natural disasters are covered by foreign media or how these disasters are covered, and how the advent of citizen journalism, which empowers eyewitnesses to break news as governments are mobilizing, has impacted foreign disaster reporting. Some of these questions will be addressed in this thesis project, employing the 2004 tsunami as a case study of the Canadian print media’s disaster reporting practices. However, a more thorough investigation of these issues is required if the ideas and theories in the literature on these and other subjects are to keep pace with the realities facing journalism in the 21st century. 2.3 Summary  Many academics have studied issues that are relevant to this thesis, ranging from everyday reporting to reporting on natural disasters, and from foreign news values to the motivations of various actors involved in media coverage of a disaster. All of these avenues of research have made valuable contributions towards understanding why and how foreign events become foreign news. However, a number of questions remain unanswered, and new questions are arising as journalism grapples with technological and social change in the 21st century. Media coverage of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami offers insights into foreign news and disaster reporting in the age of globalization, the Internet and citizen journalism. Yet as a case study, it   15 also serves as a cautionary tale, warning of the potential dangers if knowledge and best practices fail to keep pace with change.   16 3.0 Research Method  This thesis project focuses on print media and consists of a content analysis of three Canadian newspapers over the three months immediately following the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami. 3.1 Research Questions  1. How does media coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 2. Why does media coverage of a natural disaster change over time? 3. What patterns, if any, exist in disaster reporting across media organizations? 3.2 Design and Data Sources  The data collected for this analysis was drawn from a content analysis of three Canadian newspapers. The project compares local coverage with national coverage of the tsunami, considering coverage in the Vancouver Sun, the Globe and Mail, and the National Post over the three-month period immediately following the tsunami (December 27th, 2004 – March 31st, 2005). Building upon the methodology Alexa Robertson established in her 2008 content analysis of American television coverage of the tsunami, the relevant print content is coded as follows: • Number of stories; • Length of stories, by word count; • Presentation of stories. All stories are classified as either text only, text and photo, or photo only; • Framing of stories. All stories are coded into one of five categories, including four identified by Robertson (“human”, “political”, “aid” and “other”), and one new category created for the purpose of this research project (“recovery”). Stories that contained   17 elements of more than one category were assigned to the category that reflected the greatest emphasis of the story. • Location of story. Stories are allocated to one of three categories based upon where they appear in the newspaper: front page, front of section, or inside pages. The data in each category is presented day by day in order to study changes in each publication’s coverage over the three-month period. 3.3 Data Analysis  The data collected for the content analysis was drawn from editions of the Vancouver Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail published between December 27th, 2004 and March 31st, 2005. In the cases of the National Post and the Globe and Mail, which publish national editions as well as editions targeted at major metropolitan areas, like Toronto, the national editions were analyzed. This was done to ensure consistency in the content analysis, which looks at newspaper coverage available to readers living in Vancouver. Each newspaper is published six days a week (Monday through Saturday). The tsunami occurred on Sunday December 26th so print coverage of the tsunami did not begin until December 27th in all three newspapers. During the content analysis, broad themes emerged and the data were subsequently organized accordingly. Those themes were the newsworthiness of the tsunami, the scale of the event, the media agenda at the time the tsunami struck, and the emotional impact of the tsunami.   18 4.0 Findings  This section reports on the data collected during the content analysis. 4.1 Quantity of Coverage   In the days immediately following the tsunami, the three newspapers studied for this thesis provided their readers with extensive coverage of the disaster (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1: Number of Stories Published, By Date   All three newspapers returned from a non-publishing day on December 26th with modest coverage of the events unfolding half a world away. As the week immediately following the disaster unfolded, however, the amount of coverage increased dramatically. The most noticeable increase occurred in the Globe and Mail’s coverage, which peaked on January 6th and 8th. On   19 both days, the newspaper ran a total of 31 stories related to the tsunami. From then on, the quantity of stories each of the three newspapers printed on a day-to-day basis were approximately the same. The exception to this was on February 12th, when the National Post ran a total of 24 tsunami stories, by far surpassing the amount of coverage offered by the other two newspapers. Coverage of the tsunami began to decline in all three newspapers between January 10th and 12th. In terms of the word count that each of the three newspapers devoted to their coverage, peaks occurred within the first two weeks after the tsunami struck (see Fig. 2). The first to peak was the National Post, which ran a total of 12,335 words about the tsunami on January 4th, 10 days after the disaster. The Globe and Mail and the Vancouver Sun both peaked four days later, on January 8th, when they ran 23,780 words and 15,820 words, respectively. Following these highs, the average word count devoted to tsunami stories through the remainder of the study period dropped for all three newspapers. The Vancouver Sun averaged 2,412 words per day across the study period, dropping to 1,283 words per day after the peak. Meanwhile, the Globe and Mail dropped from an average of 3,531 words per day to 1,392 words after the peak, and the National Post dropped from an average of 2,315 to 1,544 words per day.            20 Fig. 2: Number of Words Published, By Date   However, simply considering average word counts does not give an accurate sense of the amount of coverage each newspaper devoted to the tsunami. This is particularly true in the case of the National Post. The newspaper’s February 12th spike to 9,505 words of tsunami coverage artificially inflates the newspaper’s average word count for the post-peak period. Had this second spike in coverage not occurred, the National Post would, in all likelihood, have offered the least coverage of the tsunami in terms of post-peak word count. Had the newspaper run 1,400 words that day (similar to the 1,402 words it printed on the following day), its average post-peak word count per day would have dropped to 1,270, placing it behind both the Globe and Mail and the Vancouver Sun. This raises questions about why one national newspaper would offer more coverage of the tsunami than a local paper, and so much more coverage than another national paper.   21 Interestingly, in only one case did a newspaper’s peak in word count fall on the same day as the peak in the number of photographs the newspaper published. For the Globe and Mail, the peak day for printing both photographs and text was January 8th, when a total of 28 photographs (see Fig. 3) ran with the newspaper’s 31 tsunami stories. In comparison, the National Post ran a high of 22 photographs (and 12 stories) on December 28th, making it the first newspaper to peak in photographic coverage of the tsunami. The Vancouver Sun was the last to peak in visual coverage, running a total of 17 photographs (and 14 stories) on January 15th. Fig. 3: Number of Photos Published, By Date  4.2 Framing of Coverage  By mid-January, according to various stories published in the three newspapers considered in this analysis, estimates of the numbers of dead and missing had stabilized. Most of the Canadians affected by the tsunami had already been located and either reunited with their   22 families or memorialized on the pages of these newspapers. In Canada, the focus had shifted, just as it had on the ground in Southeast Asia, to reconstruction and recovery efforts. This shift was reflected in the pages of Canadian newspapers (see Fig. 4, 5 and 6), where stories about aid and the politics inherent in supporting reconstruction and recovery began to appear more frequently. Fig. 4: Story Framing in Vancouver Sun, By Date   23  Fig. 5: Story Framing in National Post, By Date  Fig. 6: Story Framing in Globe and Mail, By Date   24 4.2.1 Political Stories  Stories assigned to this category dealt with actions and responses by the Canadian government, foreign governments or other authorities (i.e. the United Nations).  Tsunami stories considered political appeared for the first time on the same date – December 30th – in all three newspapers. The stories themselves, however were presented somewhat differently. The Vancouver Sun reported that Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew and International Cooperation Minister Aileen Carroll were both cutting their holidays short and returning to Canada to coordinate the country’s response to the tsunami, and noted that Prime Minister Paul Martin would not be returning from his own holiday until later in the week (Curry A7). Despite the prime minister’s absence, the story made it clear that Defence Minister Bill Graham and Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh were both in Ottawa, coordinating the federal government’s response to the disaster and staying in close contact with Martin, Pettigrew and Carroll (Curry A7). The Globe and Mail and the National Post, however, focused more on the criticism surrounding Martin’s decision not to return earlier. The National Post’s story was perhaps the most political of the three, running the story on its front page under the headline “Martin on holiday, Tories say people ‘ashamed to be Canadian’” (Sokoloff and Curry A1). These stories were the first of many on what would eventually become a theme in the Canadian media’s tsunami coverage: criticizing the federal government’s response to the disaster. 4.2.2 Recovery Stories  Stories assigned to this category focused on rehabilitating survivors, rebuilding homes, repairing infrastructure, long-term programs and projects sponsored by foreign governments, and long-term projects and programs sponsored by other authorities (i.e. the United Nations). Where the three newspapers differed greatly was in their coverage of recovery stories. The Globe and Mail was the first to publish a recovery story, running a piece on December 29th –   25 one day before publishing its first political story – highlighting the financial challenges that tsunami affected countries would face as they rebuilt (Pitts B1). Two days later – on December 31st – the National Post published its first recovery story, focusing on tourists returning to a popular Thai beach even as clean-up efforts continued further down the shore (Wordsworth A13). The last of the three newspapers to turn its attention to recovery was the Vancouver Sun. It was not until January 10th that the first recovery story appeared in the newspaper, highlighting some coastal Thai villagers’ fears of losing their land to developers after the tsunami cleared their homes off prime, beachfront property (“Thais fear losing their land to developers” A13). 4.2.3 Human Stories  Stories assigned to the “human” category focused on identifying the dead, saving the injured, locating missing persons, controlling the spread of disease among survivors, aiding traumatized survivors and helping foreign citizens return home. The Vancouver Sun was the first to stop daily publication of human stories. The Vancouver Sun continued to run human stories daily until January 14th, while the National Post and the Globe and Mail both ceased to print daily human stories as of January 15th. In light of the types of human stories that were being covered by each newspaper, the reason for at least the Vancouver Sun’s change in focus can be easily explained.  The two national newspapers tended to focus on human stories more broadly, publishing tales about victims, immigration and refugee policy decisions made by governments around the world by way of the people they impacted, and Canadians impacted by the tsunami, either as victims or as workers involved in rescue and recovery efforts. The Vancouver Sun’s coverage of human stories generally had a narrower focus, keeping readers apprised of the situation of British Columbians in Southeast Asia when the tsunami hit and in the immediate aftermath. On January 12th, the Vancouver Sun reported the body of the final missing British Columbian the newspaper   26 had been chronicling had been positively identified (Baglole A1). Although other stories with local connections emerged throughout the remainder of the three-month period being studied, the confirmed death of Richmond resident Rubina Wong effectively ended one of the last local human narratives the newspaper had been following. From January 13th onward, the Vancouver Sun’s human stories tended to focus on the health risks facing survivors and what Canada’s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was doing to combat these risks. Survivor stories also continued to appear periodically, though much less frequently than in the days immediately following the tsunami.  Throughout the remainder of January and well into February, dramatic human stories continued to unfold around the world. Both national newspapers covered the Baby 81 saga in detail (Tran A1) and, like the Vancouver Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail continued to publish stories about the many health risks threatening tsunami survivors, and Canada’s involvement in initiatives and programs to mitigate them. On January 21st, after the Indonesian government raised its estimated death toll by 50,000, bringing the total dead in that country alone to 166,000, the Globe and Mail covered the revision (Dillon A17). The next day, after the British government announced it would issue death certificates for all 550 of its citizens still unaccounted for, the National Post reported on the decision (“British to issue death certificates for missing tsunami victims” A15). From this date on, both the National Post and the Globe and Mail began to scale back their coverage of the human stories emerging from the disaster. 4.2.4 Aid Stories  Stories assigned to this category focused on charitable donations from private citizens, foreign aid offered by governments (including offers of financial, material and human resources), and logistical problems in delivering aid to tsunami-affected areas.   27  Perhaps the most striking thing about pieces classified as aid stories in this analysis was the narrative of Western generosity that emerged within this theme. The front page of the Globe and Mail on December 31st read, “Canadian donors ‘amaze’,” and went on to note that private donations were on track to beat the $40 million of aid the federal government had already pledged to tsunami relief (Vallis and Suhanic A1). Almost a week later, the Globe and Mail printed a front page story with the headline, “Donors swamp charities” (Alphonso A1), while the National Post’s front page included the headline, “World aid for victims hit ‘incredible’” (Wordsworth A1). By January 15th, the Vancouver Sun was reporting, “United Way drive nets record $30.2m” (Wilson B1). Some of the headlines were so euphoric, it almost seemed as if the three newspapers were competing to publish the most self-congratulatory story.  Some of the aid stories published in the first few weeks after the tsunami profiled specific donors. These stories focused on celebrities and sports icons, as well as unique characters doing their bit to raise money for tsunami relief. The Vancouver Sun introduced its readers to a group of local Buddhists offering to sell a temple and donate the proceeds to relief efforts (Todd A1). The newspaper followed up on the story when the sale of that temple resulted in a $500,000 donation (Todd A4). The National Post reported on a Calgary Zoo elephant whose paintings were sold to raise $6,300 for tsunami relief (“Kamala, the Calgary Zoo elephant, raises $6,300 for tsunami relief” A5), and a group of homeless alcoholics in Denmark who raised $3,400 to protest their government’s initial “stingy” donation of $1.8 million (“Homeless Danish alcoholics do their bit for tsunami relief, raising $3,400” A13). These stories highlighting the generosity of individual donors generally fed into a broader narrative of Western generosity after the tsunami.  That is not to say, however, that all aid stories painted Western generosity in a positive light. On January 11th, the Globe and Mail published a pair of front page stories under the headline, “Federal tsunami aid hits $425-million… as cash woes hurt African AIDS fight,”   28 highlighting how short donors’ attention spans can be, and how quickly they can forget about a particular crisis once a more dramatic one comes along (Nolen A1 and Mahoney and Leblanc A1). One week later, a Vancouver Sun article urged, “Let’s stop patting ourselves on the back and face reality,” in which the author opined that the Canadian tsunami response, “smacks of a feel-good effort by well-intentioned people,” but that more serious, concerted efforts were needed for tsunami recovery to succeed (Campbell D3). As time wore on, all three newspapers also criticized the federal government’s decision to send aid money to Sri Lanka, despite concerns that at least some of this aid would be diverted to support the Tamil Tigers, a group recognized by the UN and some of Canada’s allies as a terrorist organization (Wong and Clark A1). These types of stories, offering a more critical view of the so-called “aid tsunami,” tended to emerge later in the study period, at approximately the same time that human stories were disappearing from daily coverage of the disaster. 4.2.5 “Other” Stories  The “other” category employed in this study was initially created to be a general category for stories that did not fit into the more strictly defined thematic categories. However, as the analysis progressed, eleven distinct categories emerged out of the stories classed as “other,” and several noticeable differences were observed across the three newspapers (see Fig. 7). As a result, the “other” category is worth exploring in greater detail.    29  Fig. 7:  Framing of “Other” Stories, By Publication   This analysis includes a total of 205 “other” stories: 89 from the Globe and Mail, 62 from the Vancouver Sun and 54 from the National Post. Stories falling within the “other” category have been assigned to the following sub-categories: tsunami threat to Western countries, science, information (i.e. stories containing contact information for updates about the situation in the countries hit by the tsunami), economic, threat mitigation (i.e. stories about national and regional early warning systems), environment (i.e. stories about the tsunami’s impact on wildlife), memorial (stories about vigils and obituaries for tsunami victims), travel, crime (i.e. stories about donation thefts and scams), conflict (i.e. stories about how the tsunami has impacted ongoing conflicts in parts of Sri Lanka and Indonesia), and media.    30 4.2.5.1 Tsunami Threat to Western Countries Stories  During the three-month period considered in this analysis, the Vancouver Sun printed twice the number of stories as the Globe and Mail on the threat tsunamis pose to Western countries, and four times as many of these stories as the National Post. This may reflect the fact that the Vancouver Sun caters to an audience in a coastal locale, while the two national newspapers write for audiences that are mostly landlocked. As early as December 27th (the first publication day after the tsunami), the Vancouver Sun published a story in which a scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada explained that British Columbia shares many of Southeast Asia’s tsunami risk factors, and when – “not if,” the expert stressed – a “catastrophic” earthquake strikes, coastal communities like Tofino and Port Alberni could be “seriously affected” by the resulting tsunami (Ward A10). Later stories explored what would happen if a tsunami struck British Columbia, how well prepared the province was to respond to a tsunami, and what happened when a tsunami struck off Port Alberni in 1964 (Boei A6). The Globe and Mail’s stories also dealt mostly with the tsunami threat facing British Columbia’s coast, including the perceived threat motivating 14 of the province’s First Nations communities to seek assistance from the federal and provincial governments in moving at risk houses to higher ground (Hume A1). The National Post printed just one story about the west coast’s insufficient tsunami-warning system (Blackwell A1) and one about the likelihood of the country’s east coast being hit by a tsunami, as it was in 1929 (“Atlantic Canada has been hit by a tsunami before, and it will be hit again: Expert” A8). 4.2.5.2 Science Stories   The same reasoning may be applied to explain why the Vancouver Sun ran more science stories than either of the national papers. All three newspapers published general, informational stories about the science of how an earthquake can trigger a tsunami, and how the earthquake   31 that created the Southeast Asian tsunami altered the rotation of the Earth. However, the Vancouver Sun delved deeper into explaining why coastal areas of British Columbia – particularly Richmond, on the mainland, and Port Alberni, on Vancouver Island – would be vulnerable to a tsunami if a large enough earthquake ever rocked the area. Presumably, given that the majority of their readers live inland and therefore are not likely to ever find their lives threatened by a tsunami, the National Post and the Globe and Mail were less interested in educating their readers about the science behind specific tsunami threats facing coastal Canadians. 4.2.5.3 Travel Stories  Also noteworthy is the slightly greater emphasis the Globe and Mail and the National Post placed on travel stories compared to the Vancouver Sun in the three months following the tsunami. Considering the city’s reputation as a so-called “gateway to the Pacific”, one might have expected the Vancouver Sun to publish at least as many travel stories as the two national newspapers. However, some areas of Southeast Asia hard hit by the tsunami were popular destinations for Western tourists, including people from all across Canada (Sokoloff A1). In light of this, it seems that the newspapers judged Canadians across the country and not just those living in the country’s “gateway to the Pacific” to have an interest in stories about post-tsunami travel to Southeast Asia. 4.2.5.4 Basic Information Stories  Interestingly, the National Post was the only newspaper considered in this study not to publish stories containing basic information, including where people could call for specific information regarding each of the countries impacted by the tsunami. This is curious, as these types of stories can be prepared quite quickly and, in some sense, fulfill the audience-informing role of the newspaper at its most basic level. This raises questions about what the National Post   32 envisioned its role as being in the aftermath of the tsunami, and how that vision might differ if covering a domestic rather than a foreign disaster. 4.2.5.5 Conflict Stories  Also noteworthy are the discrepancies in the number of conflict stories published across the three newspapers. These types of stories largely addressed decades old conflicts in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and how the devastation wrought by the tsunami impacted the prospects for peace in both countries. These stories have periodically made it into Canadian newspapers, so it is not why these stories appeared after the tsunami, but rather why these stories appeared in some newspapers more frequently than others that deserves closer consideration. At first glance, it may be tempting to attribute the Vancouver Sun’s minimal coverage of conflict stories to the city’s relatively small diaspora populations of Sri Lankans and Indonesians. It might seem as though the national newspapers were catering to diaspora audiences, however, in both instances, the diaspora communities are largely concentrated in Toronto. This raises questions about why conflict stories appeared so often in the national editions of the Globe and Mail and the National Post, rather than in the Toronto editions of the newspapers. 4.2.5.6 Media Stories  Perhaps the most noticeable difference across the three newspapers is that the Globe and Mail alone published pieces about the media’s coverage of the tsunami. These stories covered a range of issues, including the ethnic media’s role in providing coverage, decisions around publishing disaster images, and critical reflections on overall media coverage of the tsunami. These stories are particularly interesting in the context of this study, as they suggest that some of the questions considered in this analysis were, in fact, being raised in the newsroom during the study period.   33 4.3 Location of Stories  Analyzing where tsunami stories were published also offers insight into some interesting differences between newspapers. Not surprisingly, the front pages of all three newspapers carried tsunami stories for days after the waves washed ashore. The first paper to drop the tsunami from its front page was the Vancouver Sun (see Fig. 8), which, on January 1st published a total of 14 stories: 13 on its inside pages, and one front of section story comprised of assorted Internet postings from survivors and people searching for information about missing friends and family (“Lost in paradise” C1). Four days later, on January 5th, the National Post (see Fig. 9) published a story about the tsunami’s impact on Manulife’s Asian operations on the front of its FP section, and scattered 22 other tsunami stories across its inside pages (Dabrowski FP1). It was not until January 15th that the Globe and Mail (see Fig. 10) followed suit, bumping coverage from its front page and running all eight tsunami stories on its inside pages. For the remainder of the three- month period of this study, tsunami stories would periodically run on the front pages of all three newspapers, however they would not dominate the front pages as they had in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.   34  Fig. 8: Location of Stories in Vancouver Sun, By Date  Fig. 9: Location of Stories in National Post, By Date   35  Fig. 10: Location of Stories in Globe and Mail, By Date  Even on March 26th, the three-month anniversary of the disaster, tsunami coverage ran on the inside pages of all three newspapers. On this day, the National Post published both of its tsunami stories in the A section (pages A9 and A18), while the Vancouver Sun ran its stories on pages C9 and J4, and the Globe and Mail ran one story on page A12 and published the other two on pages T5 and T6. It seems that by March, all three newspapers had largely lost interest in the tsunami story. The Vancouver Sun and the National Post did publish tsunami stores on their front pages one final time during the study period. On March 28th, the Vancouver Sun ran a piece critical of the Canadian government’s dispersal of aid for tsunami ravaged countries (Eaves A1), and on March 29th, the National Post reported on an 8.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sumatra, sparking fears that another tsunami would hit the area (Stinson   36 A1). However, these stories dealt with the tsunami only peripherally. They were more focused on new events related to the disaster and not on the disaster itself.   37 5.0 Discussion   This section explores some of the issues raised in the content analysis in greater detail and offers analysis of the findings. 5.1 Quantity of Coverage   As noted in the previous section, on February 12th, the National Post published a total of 24 stories about the tsunami. The discussion offered in this section will focus on that edition of the National Post. This spike in the National Post’s coverage was anomalous, as it appeared on a day when both the Vancouver Sun and the Globe and Mail’s coverage had dropped off to just a single tsunami story. Moreover, that single story in both newspapers dealt with the tsunami only indirectly. Both carried the news that the World Press Photo of the Year honour had been awarded to Reuters’ Arko Datta for his photograph of an Indian woman mourning beside the body of a relative killed in the tsunami (“Tsunami image captures world: Devastating loss to killer waves top picture of 2004” A17). In contrast, the National Post’s coverage ranged from survivors’ stories (“Bravery on the Beach” A20) to the impact of the tsunami on Southeast Asia and the West alike (“It was the West’s window” A14), and from outlining overseas suspicions about American motives for offering aid (Manthorpe A25) to the story of Britain’s 10 year-old Tilly Smith, whose science class taught her to recognize the early warning signs of a tsunami and enabled her to clear the entire beach her family was vacationing on before the deadly wave washed ashore (“Schoolgirl deserves an A+” A22). In light of this, there may appear to have been no reason for the spike in the National Post’s coverage on February 12th. There was not, judging from other media coverage, a wealth of new information coming out of Southeast Asia at this time. It seems that rather than merely allowing the flow of information out of the region to dictate the amount of coverage it devoted to   38 the tsunami, the National Post decided to make the disaster a major focus for its February 12th edition. On that day, the newspaper printed stories recapping statistics about the disaster, including the magnitude of the earthquake that triggered the tsunami, the speed of the waves that swept people away, and the estimated national death tolls from the disaster. It also delved deeper into stories like the “Baby 81” saga – the tale of a three-month old survivor identified by nine different couples as the son they saw swept away when the tsunami struck – and introduced readers to additional characters involved in the custody drama playing out in Sri Lanka, even though there was not any new information to report (“The fierce love of parents” A23). Finally, the newspaper seems to have used its February 12th edition to publish pieces that had been filed earlier but had not, for whatever reason, made it to print, including a story about how the Indian government was coping with relief and recovery independently after refusing to accept international aid (“The nation that refused aid” A11). This spike in the National Post’s coverage is significant because it demonstrates that the newspaper is both able and willing to act independently of unfolding events, at least some of the time. The content analysis hints that the National Post decided to focus its February 12th edition on the tsunami and its victims, disproportionate to the amount of new information coming out of Southeast Asia. This has serious implications, particularly for newspapers covering natural disasters and other types of humanitarian emergencies. It seems to suggest that, given the right circumstances, newspapers – and indeed this may be true for all types of media – can and do set aside concerns regarding professional objectivity in order to report on an issue or cause from an activist rather than a journalistic perspective. However, any media organization that does so will, in all likelihood, reach a point when it must decide that it cannot take up a cause. This is particularly problematic with regard to the ethics of reporting on natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, as media organizations may be forced to decide which lives are or are not worth campaigning to save.   39 5.2 Framing of Coverage  This section offers analysis on trends that emerged in the framing of stories appearing in the Vancouver Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail during the study period. 5.2.1 Political Stories   At various points during the three-month study period, each newspaper published stories that were critical of the Canadian government’s response to the tsunami. However, the target of the criticism, as well as the severity of the criticism, varied from newspaper to newspaper. Arguably, the National Post was the most critical of the three, pointing the finger of blame directly at Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin (Sokoloff and Curry A1). The Vancouver Sun, in contrast, published considerably fewer political stories and those that were published were less critical of the government than those printed in either of the national newspapers. Although it may seem to be the easiest answer, these differences cannot simply be attributed to the political bias of each newspaper. In the 2006 federal election, called less than one year after the tsunami struck, the National Post (“Stephen Harper for Prime Minister” A20), the Globe and Mail (“Three reasons why it’s time for a change” A22), and the Vancouver Sun (“Stephen Harper is our choice to clean up Ottawa” A14) all endorsed the Conservative party. Though the generally negative tone of the two national newspapers’ coverage of the Liberal government’s response to the tsunami may, in part, stem from some measure of political bias, the same cannot be said for the more positive tone of the Vancouver Sun’s coverage. At least at first glance, the differences in the tone of political tsunami-related stories do not seem to be attributable to mere ideological bias. A better explanation may be found in considering the mandates of each newspaper. While the National Post and the Globe and Mail both aim to serve a national audience, the Vancouver Sun aims to serve a local audience. Although Vancouver residents certainly have an interest in   40 knowing what their federal government is doing, there are numerous sources they can get this information from. Given the wealth of stories with strong Vancouver connections arising from the tsunami, the Vancouver Sun seems to have decided to devote the majority of its resources and column inches to telling those local stories, leaving it up to other news organizations to tell other types of tsunami-related stories. This would account not only for the smaller number of political stories published in the Vancouver Sun, but also for the less critical tone of those stories. While the Vancouver Sun’s stories were merely updates on the government’s actions, the two national newspapers, in fulfilling their mandates, were keeping a closer watch on the government and providing more in-depth coverage of its response to the disaster. Ultimately, in trying to serve a local audience, the Vancouver Sun devoted a great deal of coverage to a story unfolding half a world away while only peripherally covering the story unfolding in the nation’s capital. The two national newspapers, however, struck a more equitable balance between covering both the domestic and the international aspects of the tsunami story. This raises questions about how newspapers make decisions about what stories are relevant and newsworthy in light of their mandates and target audiences. 5.2.2 Recovery Stories  At first glance, it may seem as though all three newspapers published shockingly few stories about recovery after the tsunami. However, a careful reading of stories that were published in the three months immediately after the tsunami reveals that, in fact, all three newspapers generally framed recovery stories around the aid that funded recovery and reconstruction projects. Stories related to recovery tended to focus more on the amount of aid money being spent and where that money had come from, rather than on how the money was being spent or how a specific project fit into the broader recovery effort. As a result, these stories were classified as aid stories rather than recovery stories in this analysis.   41  For example, on January 26th, the National Post published a story in which NGO workers discussed how aid donations made in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami would be used to fund long-term reconstruction and recovery projects. However, because the story focused on the international outpouring of aid in the wake of the tsunami and what that would mean in terms of fully funding recovery efforts in the long term, rather than focusing on the actual recovery efforts, the story was classified as an aid story rather than a recovery story (Wattie A4). Likewise, on February 1st, the Globe and Mail reported that former American President Bill Clinton had been selected by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to head the organization’s tsunami relief efforts in Southeast Asia. The story also reiterated an earlier announcement that Clinton was aiming to raise $45 million to support clean water projects in the region, emphasizing the fundraising effort rather than the long-term nature of the projects and how they would support recovery after aid donations dried up (“Clinton to head tsunami relief” A12). These are just two examples of recovery stories that were ultimately re-framed as aid stories. This framing raises questions about why recovery stories were re-framed as aid stories, and about framing more broadly. One possibility is that the outpouring of aid donations from individuals and governments alike in the wake of the disaster became a key narrative in coverage of the tsunami. Given the sheer number of stories about aid that were published after the disaster, what Vasterman refers to as a “positive feedback loop” may have developed, whereby a theme emerges in news coverage and, over time, the threshold of newsworthiness is lowered for stories that can be tied to that theme (515). Perhaps, then, as discussed earlier, the tsunami developed as a broad theme in the news media and, within that theme, aid emerged as a sub-theme in its own right. It may have been easier for journalists to pitch recovery stories as aid stories, in fitting with this narrative theme and the lowered threshold of newsworthiness that was then applied to aid stories relative to recovery stories.   42 Alternatively, recovery stories may have been re-framed as aid stories in order to enable journalists to more directly relate these stories to their audiences. In a recovery story, tsunami victims were engaged in rebuilding efforts, but in an aid story, it was the donors – a term which, due to the aid package the federal government offered up for tsunami relief, encompassed every Canadian taxpayer – who were making recovery efforts possible. This re-framing may explain, at least in part, the duration of tsunami coverage evident in the three Canadian newspapers being studied: much of the coverage was actually about Canadians and only indirectly about tsunami victims. 5.2.3 Human Stories  For the first few weeks after the tsunami, all three newspapers printed story after story about the harrowing ordeals survivors overcame. But, as noted in the previous chapter, by the end of January, all three newspapers had shifted the focus of their human stories to the health threats facing survivors and government decisions relating to tsunami victims. Given the scope of the disaster, there was no shortage of survival stories to report on, so one might wonder why survival stories virtually disappeared before the one-month anniversary of the tsunami. It may be that in the days immediately after the tsunami, when dramatic tales of survival and suffering were abundant, the threshold for how much drama a human tsunami story had to contain in order to be reported was set quite high. Newspapers dutifully covered these stories but as time wore on, they exhausted the most dramatic stories. Though there was no shortage of stories to be told, readers had come to expect a certain level of drama in their coverage, which became increasingly difficult to find. In effect, in the days immediately following the tsunami, as the scope of the disaster became apparent, simple survival stories were crowded out by accounts of particularly harrowing ordeals. After reading the Vancouver Sun’s piece about Australian vacationer Jillian Searle, who was washed out to sea, let go of her 5-year old in order to keep   43 herself and her 2-year-old afloat, and later found her eldest child alive (Shadbolt A3), a reader could hardly be faulted for finding the newspaper’s earlier eyewitness account from a vacationing Vancouver radio reporter rather less gripping (“Local man flees tsunamis while on vacation” A1).  It is also worth considering what other stories were making headlines at the time. Internationally, in the lead up to American President George W. Bush’s second inauguration (on January 20th), newspapers were publishing pieces speculating on his plans and priorities for his second term in office and reporting on preparations for the inauguration ceremony in Washington (Alberts A13). Later that month (on January 30th) Iraq was scheduled to hold its first legislative elections since the 2003 American-led invasion, which prompted many journalists to reflect on the country’s past and contemplate its future (Fisher A8). Nationally, Canada’s relationship with China (Fife A13) and the debate about same-sex marriage (Laghi A1) were taking up ink and column inches, slowly squeezing tsunami coverage out of the country’s newspapers. 5.2.4 Aid Stories  The narrative of Western generosity that emerged across aid stories published in all three newspapers may have driven Canadians to further charitable giving. As discussed in Brown and Minty’s study of American media coverage and charitable giving, a combination of the “buy-in” and “commitment” models can actually cause media coverage of giving to encourage further giving (6). The buy-in model posits that, after reading about the generosity of their fellow Canadians day after day in a newspaper, readers would feel compelled to help tsunami victims (Brown and Minty 6). The commitment model suggests that Canadians would feel compelled to help because their family, friends and colleagues had already donated (Brown and Minty 6). By repeatedly reporting on Canadians’ outpouring of charitable donations, the newspapers may, in   44 fact, have been informally fundraising for charitable organizations. This is incredibly problematic for all three newspapers’ claims of reporting on events accurately and fairly, given how that reporting may have, in fact, shaped the story.  However, there was a newsworthy story in Canadians’ unprecedented generosity. The challenge then is how to report on this type of story without falling into a cycle where donations continue to rise dramatically simply because newspapers (or, indeed, any news medium) are reporting stories about donations that essentially serve as unofficial fundraising campaigns for charitable groups. As the content analysis in the previous chapter indicated, stories critical of aid offered by governments and private citizens did emerge in all three newspapers, however, these types of stories generally did not appear until after the newspapers had ceased daily publication of dramatic and wrenching human stories. The combination of dramatic human stories and extremely positive stories about charitable giving evident in the Globe and Mail, the National Post and the Vancouver Sun raises additional questions about each of the newspapers’ impartiality in covering the tsunami. Given the timing of the disappearance of daily human stories and the appearance of stories critical of aid, it might appear that the newspapers were assisting charitable organizations in their fundraising efforts by disseminating heart wrenching stories while delaying publication of pieces that might make Canadians think twice about donating to relief efforts. When it comes to a newspaper’s credibility and reputation, whether this was actually the case matters far less than whether this is perceived to be the case. Despite the ethical issues around reporting on charitable giving after a major disaster, the fact remains that the outpouring of aid for tsunami victims was unprecedented, and therefore newsworthy. The issue is not whether the newspapers should have reported on it, but rather how they should have reported on it.   45 5.2.5 Terrorism Stories  Several stories classified as “crime” stories in the content analysis, as well as a number of the political stories were related to concerns about the presence of terrorist groups in areas affected by the tsunami. More specifically, each of the three newspapers published stories about the likelihood of charitable donations being funneled to groups in Sri Lanka and Indonesia that would use the funds to support terrorism. The introduction of terrorism into the tsunami narrative raises several interesting issues and will be considered briefly. Raising the specter or terrorism also raised the amount of political capital Western politicians stood to gain from the disaster. Those who advocated providing aid to areas and groups where terrorism concerns existed were essentially staking their political careers on confidence in the systems their states and the international community alike had implemented in order to prevent money laundering in support of terrorism. This entailed big risks for politicians planning to run in future elections however, for some, like Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, there were big electoral gains to be made by pushing for aid to be distributed to these areas. Martin refused to join some of Canada’s allies, as well as international organizations like the UN, in adding the Tamil Tigers to the federal government’s list of terrorist organizations and insisted that the country should send aid to areas of Sri Lanka controlled by the Tamil Tigers (Wong and Clark A1). Although Martin drew criticism for his decision, particularly from members of the Conservative party, he also increased the Liberal party’s popularity among Tamils across Canada (Wark A19). With more than 300,000 Tamils, Canada is home to the largest Tamil diaspora population in the world, and, since most Tamils in Canada have concentrated in and around Toronto, they represent a significant proportion of eligible voters in a handful of federal ridings (Eaves A5). For Martin, the risk of being credited with enabling Canadians to fund terrorism appears to have been worth the potential reward of swaying a few   46 hundred thousand Canadians to vote for the Liberal party in key constituencies in the next federal election. Evidently, the opportunity to increase his political capital was one Martin could not allow to pass. Politics aside, the terrorism-related issues raised by all three newspapers in the course of providing tsunami coverage are significant. The focus on terrorism after the disaster suggests that although the tsunami emerged as a theme in Canadian print media for a time, some aspects of the disaster itself fit within the broader, more established theme of terrorism that has become a staple of media coverage since the September 11th attacks. This may explain why the tsunami remained a major focus of media attention for so long after the waves receded. 5.3 Summary   This study found that although there are some notable differences between the Globe and Mail, the National Post and the Vancouver Sun, simply catering to the same type of audience (i.e. national) is no guarantee that an analysis of coverage from two different newspapers will produce similar results. Although both cater to national audiences, there were many differences between the National Post and the Globe and Mail in terms of the amount of coverage afforded to the tsunami, the timing of peak coverage and where tsunami-related stories were published.  The Globe and Mail published a greater number of stories and photographs on its peak coverage days than the National Post did (31 stories vs. 24 stories, and 28 photographs vs. 22 photographs, respectively). The Globe and Mail was also later in dropping tsunami coverage from its front page than the National Post (January 15th edition vs. January 5th edition).  Perhaps not surprisingly, given the newspaper’s more local focus, the Vancouver Sun, offered the least tsunami coverage of the three newspapers, publishing 18 stories and 17 photos on its days of peak story and photographic coverage. The Vancouver Sun was also the first to   47 drop tsunami coverage from its front page, publishing its January 1st edition with all of its tsunami coverage inside the paper. Despite these differences, however, four trends related to story framing and the narrative arc of the disaster did appear to hold true across all three newspapers. First, pieces that are framed as political stories and critical of the government are not necessarily fuelled by inherent political bias, at least with regard to a foreign natural disaster. Also, it appears that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, the abundance of dramatic stories that can be told raise the bar in terms of the level of drama a disaster story must have in order to be reported. As time progresses, coverage of these stories may drop off altogether simply because the most dramatic stories have already been told and others, though still quite dramatic, do not meet the new standard. Next, it seems that recovery stories are often re-framed as aid stories, thereby more directly relating the story to the audience. The story becomes about what they, as donors, have made possible, rather than what people in a far off place are doing following a disaster. Finally, there does not seem to be any pattern to when a disaster disappears from a newspaper’s front page. Even an anniversary commemorating a major disaster is no assurance of front page coverage. 5.4 Implications 5.4.1 Implications for Foreign News  The saturation coverage the three newspapers considered in this study devoted to the tsunami – and the lively debate some of that coverage sparked on those newspapers’ letter to the editor pages – demonstrates that Canadians are interested in events happening around the world, and journalists know it. Despite the newsroom restructurings that have seen many news organizations scale back or even drop their foreign bureaus altogether, Canadians are still hungry for foreign news beyond so-called “calendar reporting,” that is, covering foreign elections and   48 international meetings that are scheduled in advance, rather than covering unpredictable, breaking news. The challenge then, is to feed this appetite for foreign news on little or no foreign news budget. But this challenge can be overcome. As some did after the tsunami, newspapers can publish foreign news pieces written by journalists working in other mediums who are already in place when stories break. For example, the National Post published Global News at Noon anchor Anne-Marie Mediwake’s travel journal about how the tsunami impacted her native Sri Lanka, documenting recovery efforts one month after the disaster (Mediwake A2). The Vancouver Sun did something similar, although in that instance local radio reporter Michael McLaughlin was vacationing, not working, on the Malaysian island of Penang when the tsunami struck (“Local man flees tsunamis while on vacation” A1). In addition to tapping into the pool of journalists already present, traditional media organizations can turn to citizen journalists to report on breaking foreign news – a practice that has become increasingly popular since 2004. The implications this may have for citizen journalism are considered later in this thesis. 5.4.2 Implications for Disaster Reporting  As illustrated by the National Post’s coverage of the tsunami on February 12th, when the newspaper’s coverage was disproportionate to the amount of new information coming out of Southeast Asia, under the right circumstances, a media organization may decide to set aside professional considerations – such as impartiality – in order to take up an issue or a cause. Arguably, all three newspapers analyzed in this study took up the cause of tsunami victims to some extent, publishing a multitude of stories about aid and even turning Canadians’ outpouring of charitable giving to tsunami relief and recovery into a narrative theme in their disaster reporting. Beyond the obvious issues surrounding impartiality, this is problematic in that it inevitably forces journalists to take on the work of international organizations and charities,   49 choosing which causes to fundraise for, and, particularly after natural or humanitarian disasters, which lives are worth campaigning to save. There are ways, however, for journalists working inside disaster zones to maintain a measure of objectivity without turning a blind eye to the suffering around them. For example, they can share stories with their personal networks and encourage those people to donate to a cause, or, they can donate to a cause themselves once they have finished reporting. Professionally, journalists would do better to tell compelling stories in the immediate aftermath of a disaster and, in the long run, after media attention has drifted elsewhere, periodically report on stories that remind the audience that human suffering did not end when the last of the foreign journalists left. Although this might be difficult to pitch outside the window for anniversary stories commemorating a disaster, journalists who are persistent in seeking poignant tales from former disaster zones are likely to find them, as is evident from the quantity of coverage included in the National Post’s February 12th edition. 5.4.3 Implications for Citizen Journalism   Citizen journalism and technological change have enabled citizens to begin reporting for media organizations before journalists arrive on the scene. Thanks to technological advancements, anyone with a cell phone can break stories for print, radio, television and online mediums by capturing audio, video and still images, or posting text online.  In the wake of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami, the newspapers considered in this study did not, for the most part, draw on material from the public. In part, this may reflect the nascent nature of citizen journalism at the time of the tsunami. Although blogs were popular by late 2004, the photo-sharing website Flickr was still relatively new and growing slowly. Moreover, websites like YouTube and Twitter had not been developed yet (the former was created in 2005 and the latter was not created until 2006). The absence of citizen journalism from most of the   50 tsunami coverage analyzed in this study may also be explained by the medium being analyzed. Since this analysis considered the print editions of all three newspapers and did not look at web content, there were limited opportunities for the inclusion of citizen journalism. In a print edition of a newspaper, text and a limited number of photos can be re-published – and, in all three newspapers considered in this study, they were – however there is no opportunity to share audio or video submitted by users. An analysis of traditional news organizations’ online tsunami coverage may very well demonstrate a much greater use of citizen journalism.  However, there are ethical considerations around citizen journalism that must be taken into account. Just because citizen journalists can post content online instantaneously does not mean they should, nor does it mean that traditional media organizations should disseminate works of citizen journalism indiscriminately. In their reporting on the tsunami, the three newspapers analyzed in this study demonstrated caution when re-producing works of citizen journalism, doing so sparingly and tastefully. However, as citizen journalism evolves and technology continues to advance, traditional news organizations will likely have more and more citizen-generated content available to incorporate into their own reporting. Traditional media organizations must continue to exercise careful judgment in terms of what works of citizen journalism they re-publish if they are to protect their reputations. Likewise, citizen journalists should consider issues of taste and decency when publishing breaking news online, lest citizen journalism become little more than tabloid-esque shock journalism.  Citizen journalism has proven to be particularly useful in providing coverage of major natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina and the January earthquake in Haiti, since a disaster can happen quickly and leave many hard hit areas inaccessible. When covering these types of stories, ethical considerations become even more important, as citizen journalists may find themselves surrounded by the sights and sound bytes of suffering and death. Just as traditional media organizations play a gatekeeper role, making decisions about what they should   51 disseminate, citizen journalists must exercise judgment in deciding what to publish. Like traditional news organizations, citizen journalists’ reporting can have consequences (i.e. emotional consequences for disaster victims and their families). However, unlike many traditional news organizations, most citizen journalists are not guided by proactive policies regarding standards of taste and decency. Instead, citizen journalists tend to take a reactive approach, commenting and debating when they feel one of their number has crossed a line in their reporting. Citizen journalists must continue to exercise judgment in their reporting and continue to band together, enforcing standards of taste and decency upon one another, particularly when engaging in disaster reporting. 5.5 Conclusion   This descriptive research project discovered four trends in disaster reporting that appear to hold true across all three newspapers, regardless of whether they cater to a local or national audience. Firstly, as CARMA notes, political capital is tied to the amount of coverage a disaster gets, although findings from this study suggest that coverage isn’t necessarily inherently political (9). Secondly, Vasterman’s positive feedback loops – instances where a theme develops and, over time, stories that fit within that theme are held to a lower standard of newsworthiness – do seem to exist (515). However, a second loop also appears to exist in which the most dramatic stories are disseminated after a disaster, establishing a high threshold for the amount of drama a story must contain in order to be reported. Over time, fewer stories meet the new standard and eventually these types of stories disappear altogether. Thirdly, all three newspapers tended to re- frame recovery stories as aid stories. This may have been done to more directly relate the story to a Canadian audience, suggesting that Galtung and Ruge’s hypothesis still holds true: news from culturally distant or low-rank countries must allow an audience to identify with a story in order for that story to be reported (68). Finally, there does not appear to be any pattern to when a   52 disaster disappears from the front page, or what is required to get it back there after it has been bumped. Ultimately, this study found that although narrative arcs in disaster reporting follow similar patterns across newspapers, other aspects of disaster coverage – such as in the quantity or location of coverage – vary from newspaper to newspaper. 5.6 Limitations   Although this research produced some interesting results, limitations inherent in the methodology employed to collect the data must be taken into consideration. First and foremost, the results of the content analysis were not peer-reviewed for inter-coder reliability. If a peer- review were to be conducted, some of the coding in the content analysis might be expected to change. Although this would result in revisions to real numbers, it would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the broader trends noted in the study. The research is also limited in that it seeks to examine print media coverage available to residents of Vancouver but limits its scope of analysis to mainstream, English language newspapers available in the city. A study of the Vancouver’s ethnic newspapers, particularly those targeted at the city’s Asian communities, may produce vastly different results from this study.   53 6.0 Suggestions for Further Research After donations flooded organizations mobilizing relief and aid programs for victims of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami, researchers sought to understand the link between media coverage and charitable giving. An American study found that a 700-word story in a major daily newspaper raised charitable donations by an average of 18.2% (Brown and Minty 13). To date, no similar studies have been conducted to determine the impact of media coverage on charitable giving in Canada, or most other states. The American study also determined that encouraging the media to keep humanitarian crises in the news is in the best interest of charitable organizations, however, the needs of those charities – particularly those that invest their limited resources in positioning themselves to provide post-disaster updates over the long run – generally do not enter into the media’s decision-making (Brown and Minty 13). Ethical issues aside, these areas require further research because in order for the media to act in the public good, journalists must have a thorough understanding of the impact their work can have. Another area for further research involves examining what opportunities exist to reduce the number of foreign journalists accessing a disaster zone. Ill-prepared journalists can drive up the cost of living as they stockpile food, water and medical supplies for their own use (Downman 5). Additionally, if they are forced to turn to international organizations and NGOs for supplies, the presence of these journalists can put a strain on relief efforts (Downman 10). However, as some did after the tsunami, news organizations can limit the number of journalists dispatched to a disaster zone by turning to journalists capable of working across mediums for disaster coverage (i.e. turning to a television reporter for print coverage). Citizen journalists in the area who are able to work in multiple mediums may also be well positioned to provide coverage, further reducing news organizations’ need to dispatch foreign journalists to a disaster zone. Future research should consider how to balance the need for journalists to access a disaster area in order   54 to report on it against the need for minimizing access to a disaster zone in order to best serve victims. Another area for further research is that of the narrative themes that typically emerge during disaster reporting. As Penelope Ploughman noted in a 1997 study of seven disasters – both natural and man-made – disaster reporting typically focuses on community breakdown, characterized by people panicking, fleeing the affected area and looting. However, Ploughman found that in reality, the majority of people react rationally to disasters in an effort to try and return to normality as quickly as possible (121). Though this community breakdown narrative did not emerge in the media’s coverage of the Southeast Asian tsunami, it appeared in media coverage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Bevc 61) and has been a theme in coverage of the January earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti (“Haiti Earthquake: Is the term ‘looting’ racist? Past Kanye West comments fuel debate”). Additional research in this area would serve two purposes: furthering understanding of why certain narrative themes emerge in media coverage of some disasters but not others, and exploring ways to reorient media coverage to better reflect a post-disaster situation, rather than lapsing into the familiar narratives that journalists seem to rely on. This leads into another area for further research: the ethics of disaster reporting. The sheer quantity of coverage that saturates the media after a natural disaster indicates that disaster reporting is not “business as usual” in terms of journalistic practices, but it is less clear whether the usual ethical considerations apply. This study’s findings suggest that under the right circumstances, newspapers can and do set aside concerns regarding professional impartiality in order to report on an issue from an activist rather than a journalistic perspective. More research is needed to explore if this is the case for all news mediums and, if so, why. If this does, in fact, prove to be a trend, the long-term implications of this practice for media credibility should also be studied.   55 Finally, the question of where citizen journalism fits into Ploughman’s post-disaster credibility hierarchy requires further research. Ploughman’s research has established that in disaster reporting, the media relies upon the established credibility hierarchy – usually governments – to determine the salience of issues and set agendas for discourse on those issues (119). However, with the advent of citizen journalism – be it blog entries or uploading user- generated content to a traditional media organization’s website – advances in technology that have equipped millions of cell phone users with camera phones, and websites like Twitter and YouTube that allow users to spread news faster than journalistic principles of verification allow, the established credibility hierarchy no longer accurately reflects the environment most journalists involved in disaster reporting must operate in. Due to the nature of the medium analyzed here and the time period considered, these changes were not major factors in this study. However, all these changes have empowered citizen journalists, giving them a voice in post- disaster agenda setting and challenging the government’s position at the top of the credibility hierarchy. As citizen journalism continues to evolve, the need for research into how this type of journalism fits into broader disaster reporting grows.   56 References Abd-El-Aziz, Alaa.

at the UBC Department of Journalism, including Dr. Mary Lynn Young, Alfred Hermida, Joe Cutbirth, Kathryn Gretsinger, Nicola Jones, Dan Burnett, David Beers, Barry Warne, Barbara Wallin.  In particular, my work benefitted from the school’s dedication to discussing rapidly changing media models and the role of online journalism.  I owe special thanks to Dr. Mary Lynn Young, who supported my choice of an unusual area of scholarship, and Dr. Candis Callison, who offered her own expertise in climate change research and journalism studies.  I am also grateful for the guidance of Dr. Ron Burnett, President of Emily Carr University of Art and Design. Dr. Burnett’s writings and personal assistance were very helpful throughout this process.  During my masters’ studies, I was grateful to receive support from a SSHRC (Joseph- Armand Bombardier) Canada Graduate Scholarship, a CTV Globemedia Fellowship, and a Gwyn and Aileen Gunn Bursary in Journalism.  I owe special thanks to my family and friends, who were tirelessly encouraging, and often cooked me dinner.    viii Dedication  To my father, Richard Greyson, whose love of science and the natural world has been a lifelong inspiration. After sending me articles and books about climate change for almost a decade, my father’s concern about this issue became my concern, and I’m grateful for his interest and enthusiasm.  In memory of my mother, Dorothy, who showed me a Lawren Harris painting of a snow- capped mountain long before I entered kindergarten. Her deep love of literature and painting remains a strong current in my life, and I hope she would have enjoyed the cross-disciplinary scholarship of this thesis.   1 1    Chapter: INTRODUCTION        This idea for this project began, appropriately enough, with an image. The image in question is a printed copy of a photograph, taken over a decade ago and now glued into a battered blue scrapbook. Snapped by a friend on a cardboard disposable camera, the photograph shows me sitting on the side of a snow face, anchored with ropes, harness, and ice axe. Participating in a week-long mountaineering course near Whistler, B.C., my memories now recall the hot August sun beating down on Blackcomb Glacier, and streams of clear glacial melt-water trickling along the edges of granite boulders.      This photograph recalls a personal excursion, but it also symbolizes the genesis of awareness. In the late 1990’s, I was more aware of logging in west coast forests than of global warming. I recall learning about melting glaciers and climate change in later years, and my concern was forever linked to the vivid memories I carried after my first (and only) traverse of a glacier.      Over ten years later, my understanding of climate change has altered. Now, the issue is shaped not only by my personal experience, but also by the particular types of public discourse that the issue has engendered. In the last fifteen years, the widespread dissemination of scientific reports, scholarly analysis, and mass media stories have covered the issue extensively, discussing the state of this environmental crisis and its implications for local and international stability.       While the focus of this coverage has varied depending upon content and context, news stories about climate change have discussed scientific research findings, ecological impacts, and government policy regarding greenhouse gas emissions in detail (Adam 2007, Kleiner 2009, Bhanoo 2010, Revkin 2009, Revkin and Kanter 2009, Chang 2009, Pope 2010, McKie  2 2010, Brown 2010, Ward 2010b). Public concern over climate change has even permeated popular culture (Maslin 2009).      With every article and broadcast, various visual images have been employed by media producers in an attempt to illustrate climate change for readers or viewers. In addition to graphs and charts used to show global warming trends, various types of photographic images are utilized repeatedly. In particular, two types of thematic choices predominate, and can be classified as either “fire” or “ice” images. In many of these images, visual motifs of heat or fire is repeatedly used, particularly in multi-layered illustrations of flames superimposed on an image of Planet Earth. Images of ice, ranging from melting blue icebergs to cracking ice sheets, are also used repeatedly in broadcast, print, and online sources.       While a number of scholars have examined mass media coverage of climate change from a variety of perspectives, few studies have specifically examined the visual images associated with climate change coverage. For my master’s thesis for the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of British Columbia, I will develop an analysis of images of climate change, sourced from mass media and non-governmental organizations’ websites. By discussing these images within a cultural and historical context, I hope to present an analysis that is cross-disciplinary in approach, thereby adding to current communications scholarship on this issue.  1.1 Methodology       For this project, the sources for these images will consist of several online web pages focusing on climate change. These web pages can be classified according to three categories. The first set of web pages will be generated by a Google image search using “climate  3 change” and “global warming” search terms. The second set of web pages will consist of online feature articles and climate change information pages produced by three national newspapers from three countries: The Globe and Mail (Canada), The New York Times (U.S.), and the Guardian (U.K.). The third group of online pages to be examined will be from the websites of four organizations who are leading producers of information and visual images related to climate change: the David Suzuki Foundation, Greenpeace International, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Geographic Society.      By examining the images available on these web pages, I hope to develop a specific discussion regarding the use, prevalence, and context of images related to climate change. By developing my own adaptation of the critical discourse analysis method utilized by Carvahlo and Burgess (2005), I will examine these images as “texts”, identifying general “morphological” characteristics, thematic elements, and rhetorical issues relating to the images. Twenty-two categories of specific thematic content and image type will govern the classification of each image, and these classifications will be compared to determine the dominant motifs that are presented on the web pages.       As well as identifying content and type of image, other visual and design considerations will be noted, including the relative size of images, the number of icons or images per page, and the placement of images related to text content. The structural “architecture” of these websites will also be considered, in order to ascertain how easily users can navigate the site and how prominently the relevant information is displayed. These components will not only be commented on individually, but comparisons will also be drawn between the groups of websites examined.    4 1.2 Climate change and the Media  1.2.1 Climate change background       Climate change, as presented as part of public discourse, is primarily understood as a geo- physical phenomenon associated with rising global temperatures. Caused primarily by greenhouse gas emissions associated with human activities since the industrial revolution, climate change has been called the “story of the century” by media analysts, citing scientific predictions that climate change will undoubtedly produce widespread ecological impacts, affecting communities and biological organisms around the globe (Ward 2007, Ward 2008).      Climate change, however, does not exist merely in graphs, charts, and reports produced by scientists and researchers. Over forty years of discussion and debate have re-shaped climate change as a contemporary cultural construct, acting like a “mutating hybrid entity” that blurs the boundaries between the natural and cultural spheres (Hulme 2008, 5). Without a sophisticated comprehension of how our cultural understanding of climate change operates within public discourse, we have little hope of developing effective strategies to combat the problem.      But before diving into these complex cultural issues, it is important to re-examine the historical context of climate change research. While public consciousness of this issue has slowly developed within the last few decades, scientists and researchers have been examining changing climate models for many years.  As far back as the 18th century, explorers noted extensive deforestation and a resulting impact on the climate of Mauritius (Grove 1995, 91). In 1824, French physicist Joseph Fourier developed a theoretical description of what is now known as the “greenhouse effect”, or the warming of the earth from solar energy trapped by  5 the atmosphere (Flannery 2005, 38-9).  And Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius expanded this work at the end of the 19th century, identifying the burning of fossil fuels as a cause of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which he posited would result in the warming of the Earth’s temperature (Flannery 2005, 40, Hoggan 2009, 17, Weart 2004).      In the modern era, discussions of climate change began to surface in the political realm in the 1960s, with President Lyndon Johnson addressing the issue in a message to Congress, and subsequent American politicians citing their concern with research presented by prominent scientists (Hoggan 2010, 16-20). In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), considered one of the preeminent international consortiums of scientific knowledge on the subject.  Four reports have been generated by the IPCC and circulated internationally, the latest being the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report. While earlier reports were less conclusive, the 2007 report stated that global climate change was “unequivocal”, and that much of the current increases in globally averaged temperatures was occurring as a direct result of anthropogenic (human) activities (IPCC 2007).      This wasn’t the first strong statement on climate change from scientists. In 1988, this link between anthropogenic activity and global warming was acknowledged publicly in a widely reported testimony given before the U.S. Senate. James Hansen, the head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, testified before the U.S. Energy and Natural Resources Committee that record high temperatures were the direct result of anthropogenic activity (Maslin 2009 28). This testimony became headline news in the American media, and is now  6 regarded as a pivotal moment in the development of climate change as an issue of public concern (Sheppard 2008).      In addition to the IPCC reports, national and international science academies and organizations have agreed with or endorsed the findings of the IPCC.  In 2004, the intergovernmental Arctic Council and the non-governmental International Arctic Science Committee produced a synthesis report, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, which stated that the polar regions were experiencing rapid environmental changes due to rising temperatures.  According to the report, climate change impacts would be likely be more severe in the Arctic and Antarctic than in other regions, and that “there is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities” (UNEP/GRID Arendal 2004).      Since 2001, 32 national science academies have issued joint declarations confirming anthropogenic global warming, including the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and the Royal Society of Canada. In 2001, following the publication of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled “The Science of Climate Change”, endorsing scientific consensus on the issue. This statement was published as an editorial in Science on May 18, 2001 (Royal Society et al. 2001).      In an attempt to bridge the divide between scientific research and the general public, a number of authors have written popular books describing the issue of climate change. The first of these works, written by New York Times reporter Andrew Revkin in 1992, followed the Hansen testimony to the U.S. Senate. The majority of well-known works, however, were published in the last decade (see Wohlforth 2004, Flannery 2005, and Kolbert 2006, for example). This sudden rise in public attention in recent years may be partially attributed to  7 the success of Al Gore’s 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, which won international accolades, and was credited with raising the public profile of the issue significantly (Maslin 2009 37).      But despite the popularity of many of these works, some activists and researchers are concerned that public opinion has not kept pace with the seriousness of the threat of climate change. Mass media coverage has been critiqued by scholars as being rife with bias, riddled with policy concerns, and subject to confusing, misleading debates (Gelbspan 1998, Monbiot 2006, Maslin 2009, Hoggan 2010, Oreskes and Conway 2010). According to some, the mass media has “failed to inform their readers and listeners about what is surely the most important and dangerous environmental issue in the history of humankind” (Hoggan and Littlemore 2010, 153).       Recent research suggests that this concern is warranted, as a 2009 poll from the Pew Research Centre indicated that only 35% of Americans see climate change as a serious problem, a decline of 9% from the previous year (Pew Research Centre 2009). Some have blamed the so-called “climate gate” scandal of 2009 as the cause of this decline. Hacked emails from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit were published, leading to charges that climate scientists had manipulated data or attempted to silence critics. Despite several independent investigations indicating no evidence of unethical practice, concern remains that this issue eroded public confidence in climate research (Tollefson 2010).  1.2.2 Media issues and climate change       Despite widespread scientific acknowledgement and political confirmation of the importance of climate change as an issue of concern, Western mass media has not necessarily  8 responded with coverage reflecting this perspective. Scholars acknowledge that mass media has a great influence on the public’s perception of the issue of climate change (Trumbo and Shanahan 2000, Carvahlo and Burgess 2005, Hansen 2010). Part of the challenge of presenting accurate information about climate change for the general public lies in the divide between the practice of science and the practice of journalism (Dean 2009, Callison 2010).       In particular, there have been widespread critiques of the mass media coverage of so- called “debates” within the scientific community regarding climate change. In an attempt to shed light on this issue, science historian Naomi Oreskes published a widely cited report in 2004, asserting that no such debate was a factor within the scientific community. Oreskes’ study, titled “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change”, analyzed 928 scientific abstracts published between 1993 and 2003. Her report noted that 75 per cent of the examined abstracts either explicitly or implicitly backed the consensus view of climate change supported by the IPCC and other organizations, with the remaining 25 per cent detailing methodology or other issues and taking no position on the issue. Oreskes noted that out of the 928 published reports, none dissented from this perspective (Oreskes 2004).       George Monbiot, a syndicated columnist with the Guardian newspaper, has also written extensively about media coverage of climate change. In Monbiot’s 2006 book, Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning, he critiqued industry-funded opinion groups and individuals campaigning to discredit climate change science who were given credence by journalists as “experts”.  In a syndicated column article titled “The Fossil Fools”, Monbiot argued that more often than not, media outlets were acting like the “public relations arms of fossil fuel companies” (Monbiot 2004).  9      Max Boykoff, currently working at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado, has written a number of academic articles examining the coverage of climate change by U.S. and U.K. media outlets. His 2005 article, “The Disconnect of News Reporting from Scientific Evidence”, argued that “balanced” coverage of climate change had generated a misleading public perception that there is not consensus in the scientific community regarding climate change (Boykoff 2005).      Boykoff has also examined print and television broadcast coverage of climate change in the U.S. and the U.K. His 2007 article, titled “Flogging a dead norm?”, noted specific differences between newspaper coverage of climate change in the U.S. and U.K. between 2003 and 2006. The American newspapers Boykoff examined tended to downplay or ignore scientific consensus regarding climate change during this time period, while the U.K. newspapers he examined did not, indicating that regional concerns and policy complicated media coverage (Boykoff 2007). Other articles by Boykoff show that television coverage in the U.S. has also been subject to the same biased climate change coverage evident in print journalism, and that traditional journalistic practices plays an important role in climate change coverage (Boykoff 2005, Boykoff and Rajan 2007, Boykoff M. and J., 2007).      Other scholars have shown that media outlets have presented climate change with varying levels of coverage. Two studies examining national U.S. newspapers identified specific “issue attention cycles” evident in press coverage of climate change. In a ten year study of five national U.S. papers between 1985 – 1995, Craig Trumbo identified that media coverage of the issue was almost non-existent before 1988, but that media coverage rose between 1989 and 1992, peaking with the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. After 1992, media interest waned once more (Trumbo 1996, McComas and Shanahan 1999).  10      In a 2005 article, Anabela Carvahlo and Jacquelin Burgess presented a similar study, this time examining examined climate change coverage in U.K. newspapers between 1985 and 2003. Their research identified three distinct time periods associated with British newspaper coverage of climate change, with coverage rising dramatically between 1997 to 2003, as extreme weather events “provided news organizations with concrete evidence strengthening the argument” that climate change was occurring. (Carvahlo and Burgess 2005, 1466). Carvahlo and Burgess’ study also noted that the dominant ideological standpoints of the examined newspapers played a role in the type of coverage offered.      While British and American media coverage of climate change has been examined fairly extensively, fewer scholars have done the same type of analysis for Canadian media coverage. In a 2008 article published in the Canadian Journal of Communication, Jennifer Good compared climate change coverage “framing” in Canadian, American and international newspapers from January – December, 2007. Using Noam Chomsky’s media propaganda model (Chomsky 1999), Good noted that all three regions examined showed a hesitancy to frame climate change within the context of political policy recommendations, and that Canadian newspapers were more likely to talk about climate change and global warming than either the U.S. or international newspapers over the 2007 time period (Good 2008).       While the critiques of media coverage concerning climate change are warranted, it is also important to acknowledge the complexities involved for journalists and media outlets in producing news on scientific issues. Climate change is a particularly difficult issue to cover, partly due to the complexity of the research, which involves “abstract and probabilistic science, labyrinthine laws, grandstanding politicians, [and] speculative economics” (Wilson 2000, 206). Bridging the gap between scientists and the public is a problem, particularly in an  11 era of increasing research specialization on one hand, and widespread lack of basic “science literacy” in the general public on the other (Blum 2006, Revkin 2006, Kennedy 2010, 5, Miller 2010, Mooney 2010).       At the same time, it is important to move beyond reductionist assumption about public understandings of scientific research. The transfer of scientific knowledge is not always enough to promote political change and citizen engagement (Wynne 1996, Lahsen 2005, Jasanoff 2005, Callison 2010). If public knowledge of science is trivialized, the potential for rational, informed responses from many sectors of society is ignored, “reduc[ing] human cognition to a one-dimensional scale” (Jasanoff 2005, 270).      Offering in-depth coverage of scientific issues in the mass media is an important step, but this has been made more challenging in recent years.  The rapid shifts in the media industry have had a serious impact on science coverage, as fewer writers specializing in science are employed at media outlets, and science stories are often farmed out to journalists without a science background (Russell 2010). As well, media outlets with fewer resources are less able to cover science issues effectively, often eliminating science sections altogether. The rise of online publishing has also led to many “unreliable, inaccurate” websites, particularly fueling “anti-science sentiment” and “anti-climate science” (Russell 2010, 20-23).      Science historian Naomi Oreskes offers perspective on this issue, in her 2004 paper, “Science and public policy: What’s proof got to do with it?”, published in Environmental Science and Policy.  In this article, Oreskes critiques the general assumption that science must provide “proof” in order to claim validity for their research, and she argues that this type of response is misguided. Instead, Oreskes notes that science findings can provide informed opinions about possible outcomes and consequences of our actions and activities,  12 but should not be regarded as debatable according to the standards that many critics of climate change appear to demand (Oreskes 2004).      For journalists, these concerns all play a part in the challenge of providing critical, careful coverage of the climate change issue. Navigating research jargon while ignoring the temptation to highlight the “juiciest” elements of a story is an essential part of careful climate change reporting (Revkin 2006, 225). And as one of the most politicized areas of science journalism, coverage of climate change requires not only careful research, but a “thick skin” in order to weather the criticisms of concerned stakeholders on different sides of the issue (McFarling 2006, 243).  1.2.3 Environmental issues in the media       Developing a clear understanding of the mass media’s role in developing public discussions about environmental issues continues to be an ongoing concern for journalists, scholars, and activists. Faced with the challenges of presenting complex stories to an ever- shrinking audience, journalists and media professionals are often unable to adequately research or report on important news items. As a result, coverage of environmental issues in the mass media has often suffered, with many stories either under-reported, or overly sensationalized (Cox 2006, 164, Revkin 2010, Ward 2010).      The shifting nature of the media news cycle also affects the coverage of environmental news items, including coverage of the climate change issue (Mazur and Lee 1993, Shabecoff 2000, McComas, Shanahan and Butler 2001). While some scholars have examined the strategies of environmental activists designed to generate media attention, few critics have examined the specific rhetorical construction of mass media coverage of environmental  13 issues, or how this shapes our cultural understanding of the natural world (Wilson 1990, Deluca 1999, Meister 2002, 2).       Various communications theorists have worked within the premise that the mass media have a significant role to play within the public arena, although the extent of this influence has been broadly debated (see, for example, Lippman 1922, Dewey 1927, Habermas 1962). Other scholars have acknowledged that the mass media has been subject to various societal, political and economic pressures that have impacted the development of journalistic production (Bourdieu 1998, Curran 2002).  The traditional reporting model emphasizing events-based news is not necessarily the best avenue to discuss the complexities of various environmental issues, particularly long-term and accumulative (non-visible) problems like climate change  (Hansen 1993, Allen et al. 2000).      Analysis of media coverage of climate change has generated discussion and research among scholars for approximately twenty years, with a specific focus located on media coverage in the United States and United Kingdom. Each of these studies, however, has predominantly been focused on the textual content of the media coverage, examining the types of coverage according to the issues raised, angle of article, type of analysis, and use of expert opinion. And few scholars have examined the presentation of images linked to this text or broadcast content.       The presentation of many environmental issues relies upon the use of effective, eye- catching visual images (Deluca 1999, Cox 2006). While there are certainly debates about the types of media strategies and images used to publicize environmental campaigns, years of discussion about issues like deforestation, air pollution, and loss of biodiversity has created a companion lexicon of imagery that are now largely understood by the general public. Images  14 of hillsides marred by clear-cuts logging and smog pouring from smokestacks are relatively easy to comprehend, and can be “read” as linking to specific discourse about an environmental issue.       In comparison, presenting the issue of climate change within a visual context is incredibly difficult. While critiqued as a misleading source of data, the “Mann hockey stick” was one of the few charts, graphs, and diagrams published by climate scientists and researchers that was visually eye-catching enough to warrant public attention (National Academy of Sciences 2006). Even Al Gore’s use of a mechanical lift device to illustrate temperature elevations during his lectures, while engaging to watch, has not translated into imagery that has been widely reproduced or commented upon.      In contrast with other environmental issues, climate change is a phenomenon that is occurring on a broad scale, with many impacts still only existing as hypothetical projections. Rising temperatures, changing oceans, and the other challenges associated with climate change are almost impossible to represent in the visual language we are accustomed to. As a “technologically induced” environmental issue, climate change is largely “inaccessible to the senses”, and therefore difficult to present as a hazard or risk (Allen et al. 2000, 3).      As a result, few communications scholars and climate change researchers have bothered to examine the visual images presented in mass media coverage or other communications materials. In many of the published studies examining public discourse about climate change, textual content has been the sole focus of analysis. Images, whether photographs, illustrations, or diagrams, tend to be considered mere “supplements” to the accompanying written content, and therefore not relevant to the specific study at hand (Remillard 2011, 129).  15      Within the last decade, that trend has slowly begun to shift, with a handful of scholars beginning to pay attention to the types of images and image content associated with climate change publications and news content (Brönnimann 2002, Doyle 2007, Smith and Joffe 2009, Hulme 2009b, Manzo 2010). While these studies do develop new insights into the cultural significance of climate change images, the reports are limited primarily to examining images generated within British media or non-governmental organization campaign materials. Currently, there are no studies that compare images between international publications, or examine materials specifically presented on the Internet.      Two articles by British researchers examine images presented by non-governmental organizations for climate change action campaigns. One of the recent studies was completed by Julie Doyle, a lecturer at the University of Brighton. Her 2007 article, “Picturing the Clima(c)tic”, examines the photographs used in climate change campaigns by the international environmental organization, Greenpeace, over a fifteen-year period. Kate Manzo, a lecturer from Newcastle University, presents a similar discussion in her 2010 article, “Imaging vulnerability: The iconography of climate change”. In the article, Manzo studied images from climate change action campaigns in Britain between 2007-2008.      While both studies limit their discussion to the examination of images within a social action campaign focus, they offer a great deal of useful discussion regarding the use of imagery within public discourse. Many of the images used in these types of climate action campaigns have parallels or tie-ins with media images, and both articles offer keen insight into the role of nature images and photography used to discuss environmental issues.       In her article, Manzo identifies two types of climate change campaigns, “social marketing campaigns”, which emphasize an ethos of personal responsibility, and “bearing witness”  16 campaigns”, attempting to engage individuals as citizens and consumers (Manzo 2010, 96). The images used in the climate action campaigns, including images of melting glaciers and ice caps, operated as “visual fingerprints” and “harbingers” of climate change and its possible consequences (Manzo 2010, 96).  1.3 The Visual Spectacle  1.3.1 Photography        Before examining how images were specifically analyzed for this thesis, it’s important to discuss terminology in greater detail, starting with a brief description of how the term “images” is utilized. In this thesis, the term “images” refers to visual content produced to illustrate or describe the concept of global warming. This visual content is limited to work created in the public realm, posted on the Internet and produced by mass media outlets, non- governmental organizations, or educational organizations.      The visual content described and examined in this research is primarily photographic, either entirely composed of a single photographic image, or using photographic images in combination with illustrative elements and other photographs in montage. The images examined are visually realistic, or contain identifiable elements (i.e. planet Earth).      For centuries, humans have used visual imagery to document events, illustrate myths, convey sacred beliefs, and record political and economic structures. Containing sophisticated and coded references to social norms, historical legacies, and cultural attitudes, visual images are singularly powerful elements in our society. In order to fully engage with a study of  17 visual images, it is essential to appreciate their pivotal role in Western culture, and their impact on our daily lives (Burnett 2004, 8-10, Berger 1973, Lidchi 1999, Sontag 2001).       Technological innovations, like the development of printing press and photography, have altered our relationship to visual representations in countless ways (Benjamin 1936). Older methods of visual representation, like painting, have been produced for centuries as unique, one-time creations, subject to the whims of the artist and often intended for limited viewing within one home or building. With the development of printing technology, images could be reproduced in multiple copies, extending not only the potential audience for the image but also expanding the artist’s meanings and intentions of the visual image.       With the emergence of photography, the public’s relationship to visual images shifted once again. Developed during the nineteenth century, photography re-conceptualized the world in a multitude of new ways for viewers. A radically new form of visual presentation and mediated largely by technology and chemistry, photography was a true product of the industrial age. Mechanical and technological processes were embodied within the photograph, distinguishing photographic reproduction from painted or hand-drawn images (Benjamin 1936, Flusser 1983, Crary 1999, Wheeler 2002).      For media producers and newspaper editors, photography was adopted as another means of communicating with their target audience. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, hand- drawn illustrations published in news journals increased circulation numbers and brought in more revenue. With advances in print technology, photography eventually replaced hand- drawn illustrations. Quicker to produce, photographs came to be considered to be reliable records, an “immortal” archive of public events (Schwartz 2003, 28, Sontag 2001, 11).  18      As theorists have noted, photography altered viewers’ visual perspectives, presenting the world as a two-dimensional, silent, monochrome image. The world seen through the lens of a camera was literally flattened and frozen. Mass-printed and produced, images could be replicated endlessly, and distributed to audiences living many miles away. The natural world, as seen through the photograph lens and printed in multiple copies for viewers, became a “new nature”, framed in a way never before conceptualized (Elliot 2006, 147, Bell 2002).      With the development of photography, visual perception was isolated, removed from the world of tactile understanding and privileged as a primary method of transmitting and receiving information. The photograph effectively abstracted the real world, transforming the subjects seen through the lens into objects that were simultaneously familiar and mysterious. The camera became an instrument of control, rapidly appropriating images while also decontextualizing them (Lidchi 1999, 89, Barthes 1984, Flusser 1983, Sontag 2001).      There is an odd tension existing between our cultural associations of “reality” in photography, and the actual technical complexities of producing a photograph. The mechanical and chemical processes that produced a photograph supposedly rendered it a verifiable document, recording the world with impartiality and accuracy (Perlmutter 2003, Schwartz 2003). However, the practice of photography has always included numerous opportunities for editorializing, editing, and alteration. From the initial composition of an image seen through a lens, to the multitude of “hand-made” alterations that happen within the darkroom, lab, or editing suite, photography has always included multiple opportunities for human intervention (Wheeler 2002).      While most individuals tend to regard photographs as fixed and stable entities, it is more valuable to understand photographic images as dynamic, referring not only to one moment in  19 time but also to multiple moments, multiple sources of engagement, and multiple modes of understanding. Photographs may indicate a particular event, but they also bear innumerable traces of cultural expectations and assumptions, including our need for historical archives to “validate” collective memory (Burnett 2004,  23-29).      The desire to understand photographs as “real” played a key role in their establishment as significant elements of the news-making process.  Since photographs were included in news journals in the nineteenth century, photography has become a privileged component of mass media production. These photographs, considered impartial “windows on the world”, have often become image icons, showing pivotal political and social events for eager news audiences (Perlmutter 2003, Schwartz 2003).      The role of photographs within mass media production is to illustrate specific stories, and to provide visual context for viewers and audiences. Photographs, more than text, can translate the content of a story more rapidly, so editors highlight photographs within both the printed and online versions of a publication. Photographs that contain particularly striking visual images of drama, tension, or suffering, may be labeled “iconic”, and featured prominently within a news publication. Pivotal iconic images, often taken under duress during times of war or disaster, may be reproduced and awarded for their photographic or editorial qualities.      But it is just this type of reverence for news photography that is problematic, as photojournalism, no more so than photography itself, cannot faithfully record the world in a measurable way. As mentioned previously, photographs are never impartial, but are carefully cropped, composed, and edited versions of an event or situation. According to one writer, this is the “big lie” of photojournalism, as photographic images are chosen to convey specific  20 information about events to an audience, acting as a “political construct” as much as documentation of an event (Pelmutter 2003, 11-17).  1.3.2 The digital universe       Like the printing press and photography in earlier centuries, the development of digital technology and the Internet has irrevocably altered public discourse. With the rapid acceleration of our networked and multi-platform society, images and information is now circulated at dizzying speeds. The impact of digital technology on the dissemination of information is extensive, echoing the chaotic transition period following the development of the Gutenberg Press in the sixteenth century (Shirky 2009).      With these advances, it is almost impossible to appreciate how many images flash before our eyes during any given day. Advertisements, news broadcasts, online journals, social media feeds, and a multitude of other sources push image after image into our consciousness. Monitoring an array of backlit screens on laptops and smartphones, citizens spend their waking moments swimming in an endless “spectacle” of photographs, illustrations, and animation (Debord 1967, Crary 1999, Flusser 1983).       Predictably, our society’s understanding and relationship to images has shifted as digital technology has developed. While the industrial replication of images has been part of Western culture for centuries, the advent of digital technology has allowed us to copy, replicate, alter, crop, manipulate and distribute images more easily than ever before. Technology has, once more, launched us into an age where the aura of an original artwork is almost impossible to locate (Benjamin [1936] 1969).  21      With the development of digital technology, new concerns about integrity and veracity have surfaced, notably within the context of news photojournalism. The widespread use of inexpensive software allowing the seamless alteration of images has stimulated discussion and consternation about the appropriate use of technology to alter photographs for a media audience, leading to a declining level of trust in the photograph as a “trusted vehicle of truth” (Schwartz 2003, 30, Wheeler 2002).      The practice of photography has, however, always involved manipulation of some sort. From the earliest development of the medium, photographers have altered their images according to whim and desire, carefully posing subjects for the lens, and using various processing techniques to produce a “perfect” image. Altering pixels in Photoshop then is only the latest technological development in a century of photographic experimentation.      Contemporary consumption of images is undercut continually with tension, between the “real” and the “fake”. Real events in the world are continually transformed into images for our consumption, but our proximity to the event is so distant that we are unable to trust the image implicitly. This shift means that images no longer act simply as static representations of the world, but act now as “mediators” connecting humans and technology, “as much reference points for information and knowledge as visualizers of human creativity” (Burnett 2004 xiv, Sontag 2001).      How does the digital universe operate as a forum for public discourse? Theorists have debated the potentials and pitfalls of the new era of online communication, alternately heralding the opportunities for progressive sharing of information, and critiquing the corporate culture of the Internet. The sheer volume of content online has caused concern for some, potentially undermining “political opportunity and efficacy” (Dean 2010).  22      The development of digital technology and the Internet has impacted mass media outlets dramatically, as new modes of publication begin to dominate the public sphere (Castells 2000, Sunstein 2002, Curran 2002, Shirky 2008). With the emergence of new media technologies, the relationship between mass media and audiences is rapidly being altered. Passive consumers are now transformed into active, participatory partners, or “users”, offering new opportunities for engagement and interaction (Shirky 2008, boyd 2010, Jenkins 2006).      With images now dominating our interactions with new media, developing effective critiques of their significance is even more crucial. Even more than analogue images, digital images evoke layers of complex meaning and cultural associations for viewers. Digital images are no longer static, fixed images, but act as “multimedia arrays” that can be interpreted in multiple ways and engender multiple realities (Perlmutter 2003, 20, Burnett 2004, Rose 2007).  1.4 A Sublime Landscape  1.4.1 The search for Eden       While analyzing the technology of production, presentation and display of images provides one key node of analysis, it is also essential to consider the content of an image. Content, perhaps more than any other ingredient, translates meaning and coded significance to the viewer, detailing a specific vision of the world from creator to audience (Rose 2007 2, Hall 1997).  23      Many of the images examined in this thesis present a particular vision of the natural world, using iconic content that conforms to specific rhetorical constructions related to the natural world.  As Western culture has re-shaped the natural world over centuries, so has our cultural relationship to the natural world also been re-worked and re-navigated, expressed in changing modes of visual expression and creative production. As a number of critics have noted, images of the natural world in Western culture recall an ever-shifting tension between ideals of nature-as-resource and nature-as-divine (Remillard 2010, 132, Wilson 1990, Daniels and Cosgrove 1998, Elliot 2006).      The place of nature photography and filmmaking has a particular significance here, as photographic technology has shaped our perception of the natural world within the last century. Just like news photojournalism, nature photography has been seen to present a particular vision of the world that is impartial and authentic. Photographs of the natural world, more than paintings or hand-drawn illustrations, are “windows on the world”, providing a glimpse of landscapes, creatures and ecosystems that are apparently untainted by human concerns (Bousé 2003).      As many critics have noted, however, the production and practice of nature photography and filmmaking has never been this simplistic. These visual presentations of the natural world are just as subject to the vagaries of technology and the whims of the photographer as any other type of archival documentation. As Bousé notes, “…the status of nature films and photographs as reliable science inscription, factual reportage, or documentary evidence is in question” (Bousé 2003, 235, Mitman 1999).      Despite this, the vision of the natural world presented in wildlife and nature photography over the last century has not strayed significantly, as images of unpopulated, untouched  24 wilderness continue to be generated and re-produced. Evoking the 18th century Romantic notion of the sublime, contemporary wilderness photographs and films continue to showcase the natural world as a pristine environment, stripped of all references to the modern world (Bell 2002, 7, Elliot 2006).      Despite these criticisms, idealized images of a pristine natural world continue to be circulated widely, including in the digital domain. This visual conception of the natural world as a place of refuge that exists separately from human culture is not merely aesthetic fancy, but is only the latest embodiment of Western culture’s complex relationship to the natural world. Visual images showing only untouched, un-spoilt landscapes echo a “dream of an unworked natural landscape”, a dualistic ideal that underscores contemporary cultural alienation from the natural world (Cronon 1996, 80-81, Wilson 1990, Bell 2002).  1.4.2 Virgin ice and polar animals       Many of the types of images utilized within climate change coverage and campaigns tend to correspond with this aesthetic of the depopulated and de-cultured landscape. These kinds of images are not new, but have been central to the discourse surrounding environmental politics for decades, arguably since landscape photographs in the late 1800s were utilized to argue for the establishment of conservation areas in the United States (Deluca 1999, xii, Dobrin 2009, 7, Cronon 1996).      One of the predominant types of image associated with climate change utilizes this aesthetic of the idealized landscape. For the purposes of this thesis, these images show “ice” in some type of specific scenario and location, linked to the widespread popular concern that rising global temperatures are causing the melting of glacial and polar ice regions (Doyle  25 2007). These images are predominantly photographs, showing mountain glaciers, icebergs, or ice and snow in the Arctic and Antarctica (see Figure 5 for examples of these images).       Contemporary photographs depicting the Arctic and Antarctic regions as depopulated, “unsullied” wildernesses recall not only the “picturesque” tradition of 18th century English landscape painting, but also the work of Canadian landscape painters like the Group of Seven, known for their iconographic representations of the North. Famous for paintings of snow-capped mountain peaks and icy vistas, Canadian artists like Lawren Harris’ presented an idealized view of the North that was “pure”, “virginal” and “timeless”, devoid of human (particularly aboriginal) communities (Osborne 1988, 171-172, Elliot 2006, 99).      This cultural context is, however, rarely commented upon or critiqued. It is true that images associated with the concept of “melting ice” (including photographs of icebergs, glaciers, and the polar regions) have been a predominant ingredient for mass media and public discourse concerning climate change (Smith 2009, O’Neill and Nicolson-Cole 2009). Few studies, however, have bothered to examine these images closely, or contextualize their historical and cultural importance.      There is no doubt that images of glaciers, icebergs and polar ice are visually persuasive, using the rugged beauty of these environments to capture the dramatic scale and impact of climate change (Smith 2009). But these images are also problematic, gaining legitimacy by idealizing an aestheticized vision of the landscape. By presenting visions of distant, de- populated regions, these images effectively “relegat[e] climate change impacts to a remote and inaccessible place” (Doyle 2007, 142).      For contemporary viewers, photographic images of glaciers, icebergs and polar ice not only de-historicize (and de-politicize) the issue of climate change. These types of images are  26 also unable to effectively communicate the very issue they are linked to. As photography privileges the present moment in visual form, these images simultaneously attempt to signify a long term, developmental issue that is primarily unseen, or only visible over time (Doyle 2007, 129-130).      As Doyle noted in her study of climate change campaign literature, the use of photographs depicting cracking polar ice shelves and melting glaciers for environmental campaigns was additionally complex. By showing photographs of climate change impacts (i.e. the cracking of the Larsen B shelf in Antarctica), that have already happened, an artificial tension is set in place between the effects that have occurred, and the campaign’s efforts to prevent similar impacts occurring in the future (Doyle 2007, 129-131). These photographs operate as “evidence” designed to convince the viewer of the impacts of climate change, but the complexities of environmental claims and scientific research remain unacknowledged in these images (Oreskes 2004).  1.4.3 Burning Earth       Another significant image that appears repeatedly to illustrate articles about climate change contain visual references to heat, flames or fire. More specifically, many images show representations of a “burning” planet Earth (see Figure 3 for examples). In these images, a photograph or an illustration of planet Earth is layered with images of fire, flames or heat.       Images of planet Earth recall the “classic” photographs taken of Earth during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission, NASA’s eleventh manned spaced mission (NASA “Visible Earth”, accessed 2011). Taken from a “God’s-eye” viewpoint of approximately 45,000 km above the  27 planet’s surface, the photographs from Apollo 17 showed an un-shadowed Earth set against a backdrop of dark space. The first photographs to show the Earth floating as a planet in space, the images of a stunning “blue marble” would become some of the most widely reproduced photographs in human history (Sagan 1994, Cosgrove 2010).      The Apollo 17 photographs became a powerful icon for the environmental and other social movements, acting as a visual stand-in for concepts like global unity, international cooperation, and the fragility of natural ecosystems. However, the cultural associations generated by the image of planet Earth can also be seen as potentially problematic, embodying a de-politicized and de-historicized discourse linked to imperialism and colonialization (Bossen 1985, 2, Ingold 1993, 31-32, Cosgrove 2001, 263, Jasanoff 2004, Cosgrove 2010).      After being adopted by environmental campaigns, it was only a matter of time before images of the Earth were utilized to signify an issue like climate change. In 2007, for example, a series of massive 24-hour public “Live Earth” concerts on seven continents organized by Al Gore to draw attention to climate change efforts used photographs of the Earth extensively in backdrops and promotional materials (Manzo 2010, 98).      Images of the planet Earth have also been used to denote rising temperatures and global warming, often layered with images of flames or tinted with the colour red (Manzo 2010, 98, Doyle 2007, 138, Smith 2009). But, as Manzo notes, any attempt to present a visual image of a warming planet is inherently politicized. Any “geopolitical visions of the present and the past” embody much of our unspoken cultural expectations regarding the changing natural world, often incorporating Western discourses of unity and diversity, as well as identifying  28 the global South as a “zone of vulnerability in need of Western intervention and rescue” (Manzo 2010, 97, 105).   29 2    Chapter: ONLINE IMAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE   2.1  The digital scrapbook        For many contemporary writers and theorists, the digital sphere is often described in utopic terms, highlighting endless “smooth” flows of data and information unhampered by borders, boundaries, or limits. Cyberspace is perceived as a slick realm of images and text, and “users” are techno-wizard tourists, surfing lightly through a tidal wave that is continuously re-circulated and re-freshed (van Loon 2000, Castells 2000).      An examination of online information could echo this framework, by producing surveys and analysis that emphasize the capture of data, comprehensive statistics, and conclusions asserted within the confines of academic expertise. Of course, such an analysis might threaten to perpetuate the idealized conceptualization of a digital realm of “endless and equal opportunity”, a view that has been critiqued as a “fantasy” (Dean 2010).      By examining online content with reference to cultural, historical and social context, and by re-visiting another form of “technology” that exists in opposition to the hyper-modernist arena of cyberspace, this project is an attempt to re-interpret, or interrupt, this model.      Introduced briefly in the first chapter of this thesis, my battered, blue photo scrapbook is an example of an outdated form of information and image storage, and it serves as a kind of model for this research project. Rooted in the domestic realm, the collection and display of personalized images and text recall contemporary forms of online social media, but contain none of the smoothness of digital technology. Containing torn scraps of paper, hand- scribbled notes, and cheaply printed photographs attached with tape and glue, the scrapbook is an anachronistic forum for memory and nostalgia.  30      As a model for this project, the scrapbook can potentially function as a forum for investigating image and content, and a multi-layered bricolage pulling from disparate sources (Benjamin 2002, Sontag 2001). As a messy, non-smooth technology, the scrapbook model up-ends assumptions about digital content, re-linking the digital realm with the pre-digital models of information management that are still in social circulation, despite our desires to be liberated of the untidy models of the past. By utilizing an unusual format, the disruption of “a certain drive to clarity [and] transparency…in a translucent text” may offer new opportunities for discussion and debate (Deluca 1999, xiii).      In some regards, the scrapbook also evokes elements of the digital information gathering process. Absorbing information online is decidedly less linear than research using traditional print materials, as users are confronted with multiple layers of images, text, and references through overlapping windows and parallel programs. There is a haphazard nature to the experience of finding information online, bearing the traces of other users who have altered, commented, and interpreted the information in various ways.      Like a scrapbook, this project was not designed to be an exhaustive survey of online image content linked to climate change. Instead, a limited selection of images and websites was examined, offering enough material to generate some perspective on the content and context of images of climate change. This bundling of images is not meant to provide an authoritative overview of data, but instead attempts to approach the representation of climate change in a new way.      With this model, I’m not only interested in investigating the framework of our conceptions of the digital world, but also in re-invigorating some of the academic dialogue concerning climate change research. As some writers have acknowledged, the phenomenon  31 of climate change is not a discrete, simple problem that responds well to “elegant”, top-down policy initiatives, but is instead immensely complex (Prins and Rayner 2007, Hulme 2009b).  2.2 Examining sites / sights        As part of this “scrapbook” approach, several websites containing information about climate change were examined in detail, including the pages from two Google image searches, three media outlets, and four non-governmental organizations. In total, 485 images were surveyed according to content and format. While these sites cannot be considered all, or even a significant portion, of the content generated concerning climate change research, these websites do offer valuable perspectives concerning the climate change debate.      Images were examined from the chosen websites, and sorted according to twenty-two categories related to content and format, defined according to the type of climate change content depicted in the image. These categories included images of alternative energy (i.e. solar energy panels or wind farms), planet Earth, planet Earth on fire or with flames, extreme weather (i.e. floods or snowstorms), ice (i.e. glaciers, icebergs or polar regions), polar animals (i.e. penguins, polar bears), and smokestacks / air pollution (see Table 1 for a complete list of categories).  Alternative energy photograph Cartoon or other image photo / illus. Climate summit (i.e. Cancun, UN, etc.) photograph Displaced community / refugees photograph Environmental activism / protests photograph Environmental pollution /destruction photograph Extreme weather photograph Extreme weather / ice combo photo / illus. Fire / heat illustration  32 Fire / ice combo illustration Flooding illustration Globe photo / illus. Globe (fire/heat) illustration Globe (flooding) photo / illus. Graph or chart illustration Ice  photograph Ice / snow illustration Ice & polar animals photograph Other natural phenomenon photograph Polar animals  illustration Profiled person (political figure, etc.) photograph Smokestacks / air pollution photograph Table 1: Categories       The visual images examined were primarily photographs, but there were also a significant number that incorporated illustrative components, or were purely illustrative, including hand- drawn cartoons or graphics. Charts, diagrams and graphs were also noted as part of the project.      An overview of the websites will be examined initially, followed by an analysis of the content of the 485 images and a discussion of the findings of the research. The placement of climate change information on the pages was considered, in order to ascertain how prominently climate change content is placed within the site, and how easily users can access this information (the Google searches and IPCC site were not discussed in this way, as only climate change content was displayed on those pages).  2.2.1 Google searches        Google, an Internet search engine and advertising corporation establishing in 1998, dominates Internet searches, boasting 66% of Internet searches in the U.S. in recent months (Comscore 2010). In addition to indexing web pages, Google also offers a searchable catalog  33 of listed images. While some critics acknowledge that the technical parameters associated with Google searches may exclude relevant sites, as the predominant search engine it remains a useful index of images ranked by image tags, file titles, and text associated with the website (Nissenbaum 2000, Jing and Baluja 2008, Auletta 2009).      As part of this project, two Google image searches were conducted on February 3, 2011, using the terms “climate change” and “global warming”. For the search term “climate change”, over 51 million results were listed, while the search for “global warming” images posted over 55 million results. For both searches, the first two “pages” of each search were examined, resulting in approximately 150 images for each search.      The sources for these images come from a variety of web pages, including mass media, activist or non-governmental organizations’ publications and educational material.  Sorted according to page rank and tags, the Google pages are akin to a scrap bag of images sorted according to Google’s algorithms. Each page displays a rich repository of photographs and illustrations, dominated by the “fire” and “ice” images that provided the inspiration for this project (see Figure 1 for a screenshot of the “global warming” search).   34  Figure 1: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the first twenty-five images listed in a Google \"global warming\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=       The “fire” images were the dominant image type in the “global warming” image search, presumably because of the verbal link between heat and “warming”. These pages had multiple illustrations or of planet Earth touched by every type of heat source imaginable, from candles and matches to stove elements and large suns with solar rays. These illustrations were particularly colourful, contrasting the “blue marble” of Earth with the red, orange and yellow of the heat source (see Figure 2).   35  Figure 2: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of seven “burning earth” images, sourced from a Google \"global warming\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=        The globe, as pictured in these illustrations, echoes the original Apollo 17 photographs, showing the planet centered in the middle of the frame and lit by daylight. These images, however, are not exact replicas of the original photographs. In the original Apollo  36 photographs, the continent of Africa is centrally placed, and the southern pole region is visible at the bottom of the planet. Like many reproductions published since 1972, the “global warming” images have illustrated the planet in a different configuration, erasing the continent of Africa and tilting the axis of the globe to place North America in a visually dominant position (Cosgrove 2010, 86).      While the central placement of the globe in the frame does echo the Apollo photographs, it emphasizes the status of the planet as isolated, suspended against a dark or blank background. In a number of illustrations, the globe is also scaled as a tiny sphere, small enough to fit inside a match flame, or be cradled in a human hand. Engulfed by flames, these images depict planet Earth as fragile and vulnerable, susceptible to frightening forces that are beyond control. As a “lonely speck” adrift in an unfriendly cosmos, these images recall images of the globe used in environmental campaigns, demanding that we “make a stand” to save the planet (Sagan 1994, Jasanoff 2005, Manzo 2010, Cosgrove 2010).      In the Google searches, the “ice” images were also striking, and were evident in both the “global warming” and “climate change” searches. The images of glaciers, icebergs and polar regions were primarily photographs, and represented the opposite colour palette to the “fire” images, with crisp white and ivory expanses contrasted with deep blue, emerald green, and black expanses of water or rock. While these images are generally more concrete than the fanciful burning Earth illustrations, the “ice” images still evoked a specific view of the natural world.      In each of these photographs, the icy regions are depicted without any evidence of human presence. The vistas are grand and magnificent, almost alien with their vast emptiness and dramatic formations of ice and snow. But even with the minimalist display, an internal  37 message is still evident and easily accessible to contemporary viewers. There can be little doubt that these images are linked to climate change content or context. One image, for example, is a composite of two photographs, comparing a glaciated region over an eighty- year period. Another image shows a landscape of snow-peaked mountains undercut with a layered image of dry, cracked earth.      Sourced from online news outlets, aggregator sites, and environmental blogs, these photographs show that the snow and ice of the polar regions and mountain ranges are melting, quite literally. One photograph, for example, focuses on a melting water droplet from an ice shelf, isolating this element from the blue glacial ice in the background. Another shot depicts a splash as ice cracks from an iceberg and crashes into deep water (see Figure 3).     38  Figure 3: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of five photographs of glaciers, icebergs and polar ice, sourced from a Google \"climate change\" image search. Original source: http://www.google.ca/images?hl=en&source=hp&biw=1474&bih=968&q=global+warming&gbv=2&aq=f &aqi=g10&aql=&oq=         Images of polar animals, particularly polar bears, also were evident in the Google searches. While massive numbers of organisms are threatened in multiple ecosystems around the planet as a result of a changing climate, polar bears have become identified with climate change in a unique and specific way. As a number of writers have noted, polar bears have become visual markers of a species that is vulnerable to climate change, and their image is  39 used with in conjunction with climate change information perhaps more than any other species (Hulme 2009b, 242).      Designated as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2008 despite controversy, the polar bear is the first species to be given this status due to the impact of climate change (Wiess 2008). In the Google searches, a few illustrations or cartoons of polar bears were evident, but most of the images were photographs. The photographs in particular are aesthetically similar, with the bears viewed from a distance or from an aerial view. The ivory-furred bears are part of the visually dramatic polar landscape, standing out against the bleak ice and dark water.     These types of photographs of polar bears are used frequently, evident on magazine covers and scientific research reports (Time 2006, ACIA 2005).  While these images fit into the conventions of photojournalism or wildlife photography, there is an underlying message that corresponds with the other “melting” motif images. These photographs of polar bears embody a dialogue of isolation, vulnerability and instability that reverberates through climate change discussions. Pictured alone or in small groups on fractured ice floes or adrift in deep water, the polar bear’s status as an endangered species is underscored. Frequently, images are circulated of a bear balanced precariously on an ice floe that has melted, and looks particularly unstable or dangerous (see Figure 4).   40  Figure 4: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of five photographs of polar bears, sourced from a Google \"climate change\" image search.

To use Marshall McLuhan’s terminology, the “hot” world of exclusionary, output-based print content has lost  41 ground to the “cool” medium of a new, participatory digital realm (McLuhan 1969). In a frantic effort to stay relevant, print publications have developed parallel online websites, publishing their print content as companion digital text, images, and multimedia.      Developing this online content in an era of decreasing budgets and changing technology has not been an easy process, and the websites associated with print media outlets often vary widely in the coverage and content offered online (Shirky 2009, Sack 2008, Sunstein 2009, Dean 2010,). Some sites are easier to navigate, and feature rapidly updated content, while other sites struggle to adapt to the demands of mediating comment streams, 24-hour news cycles, and the uncertain benefits of online advertising.      With these complexities in mind, the websites for three national newspapers from three countries were examined for this project: The Globe and Mail (Canada), The New York Times (U.S.), and the Guardian (U.K.). As linked to national and international “papers of record”, these three websites differ in scale, size and budget, and feature varying levels of content and coverage.      While each of these media outlets do provide coverage of climate change issues, this coverage is presented online in different ways. The Globe and Mail, for example, does not have a stand-alone web page devoted to climate change issues, while The New York Times and the Guardian does. As well, the volume of content differs significantly between the three sites.      As a result, it was necessary to develop a slightly altered approach to examine the images associated with climate change coverage from these websites. A search for feature articles was conducted on each media website, using the terms “climate change” and “global warming”. Fourteen of the most recent and relevant feature articles were examined from each  42 website, and their associated images were organized according to the twenty-two different categories noted previously. 2.2.2.1  The Globe and Mail        Of the three media outlets, The Globe and Mail is the smallest, focused on the production of an English-language newspaper distributed nationally in Canada. Based in Toronto and printed in six cities across the country, the newspaper features national and international news stories, and has a weekly readership of approximately 1 million (Audit Bureau of Circulation Report 2010).      The Globe and Mail’s website has been online for over ten years, and consists of the main news site (www.globeandmail.com), along with other linked websites corresponding both to newspaper sections and stand-alone financial management sites, as part of the “Globe Web Centre”. The Globe and Mail website attracts an average of 600,000 readers daily, and 3.2 million unique visitors each month (Comscore Metrix 2010).      While there is no stand-alone “climate change” page in The Globe and Mail website, stories about climate change are often featured prominently on a stand-alone “Science” web page. On February 3, 2011, for example, a climate change article was featured, placed on the left-hand side of the web page under a “climate change” heading, illustrated with a photograph of workers monitoring equipment in the Alberta Tar Sands.  On the same day, other environmental articles and videos were highlighted under the headings “Environment” and “Climate” on the right hand side of the page (see Figure 5).   43       Figure 5: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of The Globe and Mail’s “Science” web page. Original source: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science/  2.2.2.2 The New York Times    In contrast to The Globe and Mail, The New York Times does feature a stand-alone page devoted to climate change issues. Widely regarded as a national “newspaper of record”, The New York Times has been published continuously in the U.S. since 1851, and boasts one of the largest circulations in the country (Boston Globe 2010).  Despite falling circulation numbers for its print edition, the online edition of the Times attracts more than 30 million monthly unique visitors per month (Clabaugh 2010).       While at times subject to critique for its coverage of climate change (Hoggan 2010, 9), The New York Times has managed to devote sizable resources and space to environmental  44 coverage. Journalists Andrew Revkin and Elizabeth Rosenthal, for example, have been on the forefront of climate change coverage, writing many comprehensive and well-researched articles.      On The New York Times website, the stand-alone “climate change” page is linked as a sub-heading on a third-tier “Environment” page, and is presented under the title “Global Warming”. On the Environment page, this page’s menu button is placed next to a small photo icon, depicting a polar bear striding on an ice floe. This tiny photograph is another example of the use of an iconic image, recalling the many images of polar animals and ice evident in the Google image searches (see Figure 6).  Figure 6: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of The New York Time’s “Global Warming” button icon located on their “Environment” webpage. Original source: http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/earth/index.html  2.2.2.3 The Guardian       In contrast to The Globe and Mail and The New York Times, even a rapid examination of the Guardian website reveals that a great deal of resources have been placed into their online climate change content. The web design of the Guardian site is much more sophisticated than either The Globe and Mail or The New York Times websites, with skillful use of colour, text, and interactive features. This impression is confirmed by statements from the organization, who proudly boast that their website embraces a “mutualized” approach to journalism with a strong emphasis on digital engagement (Guardian Media Group 2010).  45      The Guardian is a British national daily newspaper, with the third largest average daily circulation in the U.K. (Reynolds 2010). Formerly known as the Manchester Guardian, the Guardian has been financially supported by the not-for-profit Scott Trust since 1936 (Guardian Media Group 2010). While the print edition of the newspaper remains popular, the Guardian website also draws a large audience, generating approximately 35 million visitors per month (Reid 2010).      The Guardian features articles and opinion pieces by prominent environmental writers, including George Monbiot, who is internationally known for his work discussing climate change. On the Guardian website, an easily navigable top banner displays “Environment” as a key category, placed in the first tier of menu options and displayed in eye-catching green text. In contrast with The Globe and Mail and The New York Times, the Guardian’s “Environment” page is not linked as part of the “Science” and “Technology” pages, but is a separate, stand-alone page (see Figure 7).   46  Figure 7: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the Guardian’s “Environment” webpage. Original source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment  2.2.2.4 Media sites summary        The Guardian’s “Environment” page features a second-tier list of menu options, with “Climate Change” as the second choice. This links to a stand-alone “Climate Change” page, featuring a mix of stories and images. As well, the “Climate Change” page lists another tier of clickable page options that are linked specifically to the issue: “Carbon Emissions”, “Climate Talks”, “Energy”, “Fossil Fuels”, and the “IPCC”. One separate page has even been created to address the “Climategate” issue, listed under a less controversial “Hacked climate science emails” title  (see Figure 8).   47  Figure 8: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the Guardian’s “Climate Change” webpage. Original source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change         In the three media sites surveyed, the images associated with the climate change feature articles were all photographs, primarily containing subject matter that related in some way to the feature article. Captions were included, describing the specific content of each photograph and how it related to the article. Overall, the photographs on the media sites tended to be more specific in content, presented as straightforward “news” photographs without the illustrative elements seen in the Google search images.  48       While the illustrative images of burning globes and melting glaciers were largely absent on the media sites, these websites still tended to present images that largely conformed to generalized content categories. But while “fire” and “ice” images were less commonly used, other types of images were seen frequently, particularly photographs of smokestacks and extreme weather conditions (see section 2.3 for a more detailed examination).  2.2.3 Organizations       The websites of four organizations were surveyed for this project: Greenpeace International, the David Suzuki Foundation, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Geographic Society. While each of these organizations operates from a not-for-profit standpoint, the aims and relevance within the climate change community vary greatly for each group.      Two organizations (the David Suzuki Foundation and Greenpeace International) are environmental organizations, promoting public environmental campaigns with accompanying reports and promotional material designed for a general audience. While both organizations have different approaches to their public campaigns, the Suzuki Foundation and Greenpeace place climate change activism prominently in their online site, with stand-alone pages devoted to this content.  2.2.3.1 David Suzuki Foundation        Founded in 1991 by Canadian scientist and environmental activist David Suzuki, the David Suzuki Foundation advocates for various environmental issues, targeting a primarily  49 Canadian audience. Based in Vancouver, B.C., the Suzuki Foundation has approximately 40,000 individual donors, and an annual budget of approximately $ 7 million (David Suzuki Foundation 2010).      On the Suzuki Foundation website, images are used sparingly, and there is much less visual content than on the other websites examined. Overall, the majority of visual images depicted generalized content linked to the subject of each article or page. In fact, each photograph appeared to be stock photographs, with no recognizable identifying trait or feature distinguishing it as an original shot taken for the organization specifically.      On the pages featuring climate change content, the displayed photographs fit into a number of different categories. On the “Science and Policy” page, for example, there are three photographs listed under the title, “Climate Change Basics”, depicting a set of smokestacks, clouds rising from a smokestack, and a wind turbine. Other images found on the climate change content pages of the website included photographs of glaciers, polar ice, and extreme weather (see Figure 9).  50  Figure 9: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the David Suzuki Foundation’s “Science and Policy” webpage. Original source: http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate- change/science/         Like the Suzuki Foundation, the Greenpeace International website features a stand-alone page devoted to climate change information. Established in 1970 in Vancouver, BC, Greenpeace gained prominence with widely publicized, “media savvy” activist campaigns targeting various environmental issues, including international whaling operations and offshore drilling (Dale 1996). Relying on individual donations and foundation grants, the organization now has an international office based in Amsterdam, and a multi-million dollar annual budget (Greenpeace 2010).      While there are photographs related to specific Greenpeace activist campaigns on their website, there are also a number of images that fit with the generalized content seen on other websites. On the “Stop climate change” page, a large photograph of an alternative energy  51 wind farm is displayed.  Below this image, there is a photograph of smokestacks. And on the “Global Melting” page, describing the impacts of climate change, a picture of polar ice is featured (see Figure 10).  Figure 10: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of Greenpeace International’s “Climate Change” webpage. Original source: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/        A photograph of polar bears is also evident, used on a “Please donate” link near their climate change content, and also on the  “Arctic and Antarctic” climate change information page. The photograph depicts a polar bear in a precarious position, jumping onto an adjacent ice floe over a dark current of water below, another example of the image of a polar bear used as a recurring and familiar icon of climate change (see Figure 11).   52  Figure 11: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of Greenpeace International’s “Please donate” button on their “Arctic Impacts” webpage. Original source: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/       Images of “charismatic” animals (i.e. polar bears, whales, etc.) have been used often in Greenpeace campaigns, partly as a tool to elicit public response (Dale 1996). One campaign director for a local Greenpeace office stated last fall in an interview that “…[p]eople definitely respond to charismatic megafauna, like whales [and] polar bears…Images of destruction and animals in distress invoke a response for sure - it helps them understand what’s at risk or what’s at stake” (Interview conducted November 10, 2010 - Greyson 2010). A communications director for another Vancouver-based environmental organization agreed, saying, “[w]e always try to get images of a creature that people can relate to, like a marine mammal.” (Interview conducted November 12, 2010 - Greyson 2010). In an attempt to solicit attention and support, environmental organizations continue to rely on the use images of recognizable flagship species with iconic appeal (Clucas, McHugh and Caro 2008).     53 2.2.3.2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change       While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does not engage in the same types of public campaigns that Greenpeace and the Suzuki Foundation do, it is recognized as a leading authority and disseminator of climate change information and content. Founded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the IPCC is widely recognized as an international authority on the scientific research concerning climate change, generating reports based on recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information (IPCC website, accessed 2010).        As a generator of scientific and technical reports, the IPCC website pages are predominantly text-based. As this project was concerned with digital images displayed on accessible webpages, the scientific diagrams located within the reports were examined, but not included as part of the content study. Instead, the digital scans of the report covers of the IPCC reports posted on the website were surveyed, as these images contained the illustrative content useful to this study. While these images were not given additional illustrative elements (like fire or flames, for example), the images were still generalized photographs that conformed to many of the content categories in this survey. Photographic images of planet Earth, for example, did recur several times. In the sample screenshot, the 2007 IPCC reports show two images of the globe – one using a photographic representation similar to the Apollo image, and one using a traditional map layout. Other images showed alternative energy projects, extreme weather, or smokestacks or air pollution (see Figure 12).   54   Figure 12: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot detail of four report covers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2007 Fourth Assessment Report series. Original source: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml   2.2.3.3 National Geographic Society        In contrast to the other organizations, the National Geographic Society is not primarily identified as an advocacy group for environmental causes. While their mandate is educational, with a focus on the promotion and conservation of natural and cultural resources, the organization is primarily identified as a media outlet responsible for the publication of iconic, widely distributed magazines and multimedia content.      Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the National Geographic Society was established in 1888, and is perhaps best well known for their flagship magazine publication, National Geographic. This magazine features photo-essays and text content, and is published in 28 languages and with an estimated circulation of 30-50 million. Natural history and ecological issues are some of the key subjects covered in the magazine, which features full-colour, iconic photographic content (Remillard 2011).  55       Like the magazine, the National Geographic website features large-scale photographs, placed more prominently then images on the other websites surveyed. Many of these photographs are dramatic landscapes shot in vivid colour, similar to the visual iconography featured in the print magazines published by the Society. These photo-essays, while ostensibly presenting a conservationist ethic, often present an ambiguous vision of environmental risk (Remillard 2010, 139).       On the website, images illustrating climate change content conform to the idealized photographs reproduced on calendars and tourist postcards. Landscapes, for example, are shown largely as depopulated, without evidence of human communities. Other images show “charismatic” or “flagship” wildlife species, usually mammals that are “memorable” and easily recognized (Clucas et al. 2008, 1518).        For example, on the day the site was surveyed (February 9, 2011), the “Global Warming” page featured a prominent photograph of “rapidly shrinking” Greenland ice, displayed with the title “Melt Zone”. This photograph echoes other “ice” images illustrating climate change from the Google image search. Shot from a low angle against a pale blue sky, the white formations are particularly dramatic, curving above a vivid blue stream of water that slices through the core of the ice (see Figure 13).   56  Figure 13: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the National Geographic Society’s “Global Warming” webpage. Original source: http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/?source=NavEnvGlobal        Below the main feature photograph on the “Global Warming” page, three other photographs depict other idealized, photogenic landscapes. One photograph, linked to a page titled “Effects”, shows an image of a snow-topped mountain range with wildflowers in the foreground. Another photograph shows glistening sea ice in front of a setting sun, and another depicts a brilliant white iceberg set against a blue sky.      While the photographs on the National Geographic website display skilled composition and beautiful aesthetics, they echo the de-personalized stock photos displayed on the Suzuki Foundation website. Each photograph slots in to the accompanying subject matter, like an icon from a children’s colouring book. On the “Causes” page, for example, a large  57 photograph of four smokestacks is featured, showing billowing clouds of smoke (greenhouse gas emissions? Steam?) clouding the sky (see Figure 14).   Figure 14: Figure removed for copyright reasons. It was a screenshot of the National Geographic Society’s “Causes” page, linked from their “Global Warming” webpage. Original source: http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/gw-causes        58  2.3 Emerging patterns       While the scope of this project is limited due to time and research constraints, it is still possible to track the emergence of a pattern of prevalent types of images illustrating climate change content. After months of skimming through online content, these visual landmarks become evident everywhere I look. Silent, icy landscapes and steadfast polar bears pop up on magazine covers, for example (see Nature, Dec. 16, 2010). In news items, book covers, and campaign materials, planets burn helplessly, and factories belch billowing clouds into hazy skies.      These formulaic compositions aren’t simply anomalies, but form a dense, recursive patchwork of images. While articles, essays and reports discuss the endlessly varying minutiae of rapidly changing government policy, research findings, and public debate, the images illustrating this content perform the opposite function, cycling through a pat, narrow set of visual options that are numbingly familiar.      For this project, defining the content of the surveyed images indicates a pattern of predominant, even iconic images illustrating climate change. In the Google image searches, for example, “fire” and “ice” images are continuously recycled. Images of planet Earth, for example, were the most common, accounting for 28.6% of the surveyed images, with approximately half of these images displaying a fire or heat motif.      Images of ice were also commonly found in the Google searches. Photographs of ice, glaciers and polar caps accounted for 12.7% of the images generated in the two searches, and photographs of ice and polar images represented 7.1% of the total images. Of the total 308  59 images examined in the Google searches, 72 contained some reference to ice, accounting for 22.4%. By adding images of polar animals without ice, the total number rises to 24.3%.       One point of comparison between the two Google image searches is the different number of graphs and charts, which accounted for 16.1% of the total images in the “climate change” search, but only 3.3% in the “global warming” search. As the term “climate change” is more prominently used by agencies and organizations that are responsible for academic and policy discussions and dissemination of information (including scientific research, professional organizations, and government bodies), this may explain this discrepancy.      As well, photographs of extreme weather were represented in the “climate change” search (3.2%), and an additional 2.6% of the images depicting extreme weather combined with ice, for a combined total of 5.8%. In contrast, there were no images of extreme weather or extreme weather combined with ice in the “global warming” search.      In the “global warming” search, images of planet Earth (represented with fire elements and without) were predominant, accounting for 34.7% of the total images. In contrast, images of planet Earth (represented with fire elements and without) accounted for only 22.5% of the total images of the “climate change” search.      In the “climate change” search, other images were more commonly represented. For example, images of smokestacks or air pollution accounted for 12.3% of the images surveyed. In comparison, only 3.9% of the images listed in the “global warming” search depicted air pollution or smokestacks.      There were some images of extreme weather, but some types of images were absent. For example, there were no images of alternative energy sources, like wind farms or solar power (see Table 2).  60    GOOGLE SEARCHES (combined)   TOTAL % Globe (fire/heat) illustration 45 14.6 Cartoon or other image photo / illus. 45 14.6 Globe photo / illus. 43 14.0 Ice  photograph 39 12.7 Graph or chart illustration 30 9.7 Smokestacks / air pollution photograph 25 8.1 Ice & polar animals photograph 22 7.1 Fire / heat illustration 19 6.2 Flooding illustration 11 3.6 Polar animals  illustration 6 1.9 Extreme weather photograph 5 1.6 Ice / snow illustration 4 1.3 Extreme weather / ice combo photo / illus. 4 1.3 Climate summit (i.e. Cancun, UN, etc.) photograph 4 0.0 Fire / ice combo illustration 3 0.0 Globe (flooding) photo / illus. 1 0.0 Environmental activism / protests photograph 1 0.0 Displaced community / refugees photograph 1 0.0 Profiled person (political figure, etc.) photograph 0 0.0 Other natural phenomenon photograph 0 0.0 Environmental pollution /destruction photograph 0 0.0 Alternative energy photograph 0 0.0   308 96.8 Table 2: Google searches (combined)        In the media searches, the feature articles examined using the search terms “climate change” and “global warming” discussed various issues, including the appointment of a new Federal Environment Minister, and the recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Cancun, Mexico (November 29 – December 10, 2010). Some articles did use specific photographs linked to this content, but other articles were illustrated with more generic images of smokestacks or extreme weather.  61      Of the fourteen articles examined from The Globe and Mail, three contained images of smokestacks or air pollution, and three showed images from the Cancun summit. Two showed photographs of a specific person profiled in the article (i.e. political figure), and two articles showed images of extreme weather (i.e. snowstorms, flooding, etc.). Two articles showed other natural phenomenon linked to information presented in the feature article (i.e. algae on a lake in Saskatchewan). There was one image of refugees displaced by climate change impacts.       While The New York Times does use the term “Global Warming” in their coverage, a search using the term “climate change” also generated sufficient articles to ensure comparisons with The Globe and Mail and the Guardian. As in The Globe and Mail coverage, only photographs were presented associated with the feature articles. These photographs, as with The Globe and Mail, appeared to be selected to refer specifically to the topic of the article, and there were no examples of generalized iconic illustrations of “burning Earth”.      Of these selected articles in The New York Times articles, there was only one image of smokestacks or air pollution, compared with three images in The Globe and Mail survey. In The New York Times articles, three included images of a profiled person (i.e. political figure), and three showed images of other natural phenomenon that were linked specifically to the article. Two of the images showed evidence of extreme weather (i.e. snowstorms on the East Coast), and two articles showed examples of alternative energy (i.e. wind power turbines). Again, in comparison with the Google searches, there were few images of polar ice, glaciers, and polar animals, with only one image featured of each.  62      As with The Globe and Mail and The New York Times survey, the fourteen feature articles selected from the Guardian website were chosen using the search terms “climate change” and “global warming” (seven articles from each term). Like the other outlets, each feature article used only photographs to illustrate these articles, and the photograph was placed on the left hand side of the page, near the first paragraph.      In the Guardian articles, photographs of smokestacks and air pollution were more commonly used than in The Globe and Mail and The New York Times articles, accounting for six of the fourteen articles examined. As well, there were three pictures of alternative energy sources (i.e. windfarms or solar panels), and two photographs of extreme weather. As with The Globe and Mail and The New York Times articles, there were no generalized images associated with “fire” or “ice” motifs.      After examining all three media sources, it is evident that there is a distinct break from the imagery evident in the Google search. In contrast with the images generated by Google and sourced from media outlets, news aggregators, and various blogs, these media sites used photographs almost exclusively to complement their text content, and generally did not use graphic images with layering or illustrative elements. There were no images using the “burning Earth” motif, or any other type of play on the term “global warming”. In the articles examined, there were also no cartoons evident. All the images in the media coverage examined were “news” photographs, presented without additional elements, colours, or overlaid text.      As well, instead of the vague, conceptual illustrations of “fire” and “ice” found in the Google searches, the feature articles from the three media sites predominantly tried to use photographs that related directly to the subject matter. Beyond The New York Times polar  63 bear icon, few of the iconic “fire and ice” images evident in the Google searches were used (see Table 3).

As discussed above, the website of each of these organizations profiled varies widely, according to scope, mandate, design, and audience.      Despite these differences, the organizations’ websites used imagery that closely paralleled the photographs and illustrations found in the media and Google searches. Photographs of ice  64 (glaciers, polar ice and icebergs), for example, were the most common type of image on these websites, accounting for 17.8% of the images examined. Images of extreme weather events, alternative energy projects, and smokestacks were also used extensively. Images of the globe were also evident, although there were few of the “burning Earth” illustrations displayed.       One key difference with this search was the placement of images of environmental activism and protest campaigns. These images, accounting for 8.1% of the total, were found primarily on the Greenpeace site, which has a long history of documenting and publicizing their activist campaigns (Dale 1996) (see Table 4).

Images of ice, snow and polar animals are slightly more common, accounting for 21% of the total images. Taken as separate categories, photographs of ice (including glaciers, icebergs and polar regions) are the second-most common category, with 13.2% of the total images.       Images of the globe were also common, either with or without the “fire” motif. Images of the globe without fire elements were the third most popular category, accounting for 10.3% of the images, while the two categories combined equaled 19.6% of the total images.       Photographs of smokestacks and air pollution were the fourth-most popular category, accounting for 9.7% of the images (see Table 5).              66 GOOGLE SEARCHES, MEDIA & ORGANIZATION RESULTS   TOTAL % Cartoon or other image photo / illus. 65 13.4 Ice  photograph 64 13.2 Globe photo / illus. 50 10.3 Smokestacks / air pollution photograph 47 9.7 Globe (fire/heat) illustration 45 9.3 Graph or chart illustration 35 7.2 Ice & polar animals photograph 25 5.2 Fire / heat illustration 22 4.5 Alternative energy photograph 21 4.3 Extreme weather photograph 19 3.9 Other natural phenomenon photograph 18 3.7 Environmental activism / protests photograph 12 2.5 Climate summit (i.e. Cancun, UN, etc.) photograph 11 2.3 Flooding illustration 11 2.3 Environmental pollution /destruction photograph 9 1.9 Profiled person (political figure, etc.) photograph 8 1.6 Polar animals  illustration 6 1.2 Displaced community / refugees photograph 5 1.0 Ice / snow illustration 4 0.8 Extreme weather / ice combo photo / illus. 4 0.8 Fire / ice combo illustration 3 0.6 Globe (flooding) photo / illus. 1 0.2   485 100.0 Table 5: Google, media, and NGO results (combined)        While the scope of this research is limited, it is evident that the websites surveyed do continue to utilize certain types of content to illustrate coverage of climate change issues. Images of burning planets, icy landscapes, and forlorn polar bears, continually re-circulating in a variety of online venues and formats, repeats specific narratives about fragile landscapes, pristine natural environments, and the uneasy role humans play in the natural world.      This study also reveals the strong emergence of other images, particularly the photographs of smokestacks and extreme weather conditions. With the numerous natural disasters and extreme weather episodes that have occurred in recent years, photographs of flooding, snowfalls, or hurricanes tend to relate to current events in specific locations. In an interview  67 conducted for this project, a media editor noted that using these photographs brought climate change issues “closer to home”, enabling greater sympathy for audiences (Smith and Joffe 2009).      The images of smokestacks are particularly intriguing, since they were evident in both the media and organizations’ websites. Rarely identified as linked to a specific industry or location, there is no clear notation describing the type of emission or what (if anything) is actually burning or being released. Without labels or context, these photographs of smokestacks are menacing, but it is unclear what the nature of the threat is.      As an icon of modernity and industrial production, the smokestack image reinforces the endangerment of contemporary risk in our society (Beck 1992, Spiegel 2001, 16). There have been enough of these images used to provide a conceptual link between the images of smokestacks and the concept of greenhouse gas emissions. A quick Google image search using the terms “greenhouse gas” reveals many pages of smokestack photographs. Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth, for example, used an illustration of smokestacks for their poster and promotional campaign.          68 3    Chapter: CONCLUSION  3.1 The empty mirror       Scrapbooks function traditionally as an empty repository for images and objects linked to personal experience, with a one-way trajectory from blank page to scribbled, layered catalogue of memory and nostalgia. Attempting to collect online images of climate change does not follow a parallel path, however, as re-cycled photographs and illustrations circulate endlessly, providing little traction for engagement or understanding. Empty of context, these images reflect what the viewer projects (Bolter 2003, 20, Burnett 2004, 205).       This may be due to the surprising lack of contextual resonance found in many of these images, particularly those photographs and illustrations of de-populated or isolated landscapes. From the icy plains of the polar regions to the detached, suspended illustrations of planet Earth, these images seem to have been scoured of any reference to human activity or agency.      It is perhaps more than mere irony that these images, apparently divorced from human content, have come to be linked to one of the most challenging environmental and political issues of our age. The phenomenon of climate change emerged initially from the journals of scientific research and has been largely defined within the boundaries of scientific discussion. The images that have been associated with climate change content have, in an odd way, also fallen into this rubric of impartiality and objectivity. Unsullied by the “hand at work in the human fabric of science”, these de-personalized images uphold the “sanctity of objectivity” (Latour 2002, 18). While not necessarily containing references to scientific research, these images have been placed in conjunction with scientific findings so frequently  69 that they appear to be impartial as well. In Gore’s companion book, An Inconvenient Truth, for example, photographs of melting glaciers and planet Earth recur frequently next to graphs and charts describing various elements of climate research, imparting the photographs and illustrations the same “impartiality” given to the other illustrations (Gore 2006).      In an odd double blind, however, these images are linked to an issue that inspires deep passions, inspiring almost-evangelical displays of devotion or dismissal. As a “plastic” phenomenon, climate change exposes “both our individual selves and our collective societies” (Hulme 2009b, 357). Emptied of meaning, these images act like “untroubled mirror[s]” reflecting our own images back to ourselves (Foucault 1994, 27).      Functioning as blank mirrors, climate change images can arguably be utilized as a type of rhetoric. Traditionally, propaganda studies have examined the efforts of various interests to influence or sway public opinion towards a particular cause or idea. While the use of climate change images does not tidily fall into such an analysis, there are elements of this scholarship that can provide insight into the use of these photographs or illustrations.      Images, like text, can be useful tools of rhetorical persuasion, and many scholars have examined the particular significance of visual imagery in political propaganda (Jowett and O’Donnell 1999, Corner and Richardson 1993). Invoking emotion, visual images can be “powerful political tools, engaging people’s attention”, and ultimately changing our beliefs (Perlmutter 2003, 2, Deluca 1999).       But can images of climate change be seen purely as persuasive devices? Many of the images described in this thesis can be associated with messages about risk. Images of melting glaciers and cracking ice floes, for example, can symbolize a “beautiful devastation”, creating a sense of shock when viewers understand that this landscape is endangered (Doyle  70 2007, 132). Photographs illustrating climate change content can be classified as potent symbols of “collective danger and individual vulnerability” to viewers and audiences (Manzo 2010, 97).      While environmental risk communication is a well-developed field of scholarship, there are few, if any, examinations of visual images associated with risk communications, like the images of smokestacks and melting glaciers evident in this study (Remillard 2011, 129). Visual images, even more than text, can create new cognitive associations and potentially strengthen the impact of risk messages (Smith 2005). As a result, the importance of visual imagery should not be discounted when discussing public discourse concerning climate change.      As some scholars have noted, the inclusion of text or visual elements that induce fear in an audience has often been utilized both in mass media coverage and environmental campaign literature. Alarmist, inflammatory language and imagery have often been utilized in order to create a sense of drama, draw attention, and inspire action from the public (Cox 2006, Doyle 2007, O’Neill and Nicolson-Cole 2009).      One survey of U.K. media coverage, for example, noted that media outlets consistently used inflammatory language in their coverage of the release of the IPCC 2007 report. Although each of these newspapers appeal to various demographics, nine of the ten outlets surveyed presented a uniform message of  “rising anxiety”, using adjectives like “shocking”, “terrifying”, or “devastating” in their articles. As well, words like “final”, “fears”, and “disaster” in the headlines, all terms that were not used in either the IPCC report or corresponding public presentations by the IPCC in Paris (Hulme 2007). Other critics warn that the publicizing of climate research, through the efforts of organizations like the IPCC  71 and individual works like An Inconvenient Truth, often incorporates a level of “emotionalizing” that may be prove to deter rational debate (Buse 2007).      Interestingly, a corresponding online search of leading newspapers in the United States for the same time period showed headlines that were much more measured in tone, suggesting a “more neutral” representation of the IPCC’s key message in the U.S. In a letter to the British science journal Nature, researcher Mike Hulme argued that the tone of coverage in the U.K. was appealing to fear in order to generate a sense of urgency, but was ultimately misguided, as such appeals “often lead to denial, paralysis [or] apathy” (Hulme 2007).      Others scholars concur with this assessment, and studies on hazards and risks have determined that detailed, accurate information is not enough to influence public concern about specific issues. While access to factual information is important, people are also largely affected by emotional concerns, of which images play an important role  (Lorenzoni 2006, Smith 2009).       There is a lack of consensus about the efficacy of using strong, powerful appeals in order to sway public opinion. It is understandable that a tone of urgency has been utilized in the development of rhetoric concerning climate change issues, partly because this type of terminology and framework has been a component of environmental activist campaigns for many years (Dale 1996). Some argue that this type of rhetoric is necessary in order to draw attention to important issues, and underline the critical nature of the cause (Hulme 2009b, 233).      But does this type of tactic produce effective social change? Two studies were conducted in the U.K. to determine the influence of visual and iconic representations of climate change, and concluded that images designed to appeal to a viewer’s sense of fear may be assumed to  72 be more memorable and attract greater attention.  However, iconic images like melting glaciers, cracking polar ice caps, and extreme weather scenes “can also act to distance and disempower individuals”, effectively disabling a sense of personal engagement with the issue (O’Neill and Nicolson-Cole 2009, 374-5).  3.2 A patchwork narrative       While many may not necessarily concur on the proper tactics needed to address climate change, it would not be hard to agree that the results from over twenty years of “science, economics, international relations, diplomacy and politics” have not yielded comprehensive, satisfactory solutions to the problem (Hulme 2009b). The awkward, stilted circulation of images illustrating climate change content emphasizes the scope of this problem. Our current visual imagination seems to be stuck on an “either/or” groove, cycling through a predictable mix of smokestacks or polar bears, burning planets or melting glaciers.      Used repeatedly, images have been blamed for causing complacency or “numbness” in audiences weary of visual stimulation (Green, Mann and Story 2006). While generating complacency may not be the goal of campaigners or web editors, it may be useful to acknowledge that the repetition of climate change images may partly hinge on their iconic status. It may be easier to illustrate the new and often confusing articles, research and reports generated about climate change with images that are easy to comprehend.      Should these images of melting glaciers and polar bears on thin ice be discarded completely? American photojournalist Gary Braasch, for example, has spent a decade documenting the effects of climate change around the world, and many of his published images depict smokestacks, floods, and melting ice (Braasch 2007). These images may  73 contain overused content, but others would argue that accurate, vivid photo-documentation is useful, inspiring greater awareness with its “sobering” message (Ward 2007).      However, by narrowing our collective gaze solely on the images of risk and impact, we may have impaired our ability to understand and address the issue of climate change more carefully. There seems to be a deeper reluctance to acknowledge the complexities of our understanding of climate as a cultural construct, and an absence of discussion about how we have used the context of climate in various ways over many centuries. Just like the natural world, our climate has been the subject of both benign indifference and imperialistic attempts at dominance, identified at times as fragile and pristine, or dangerous and chaotic (Hulme 2009b, 22-7).      Some may argue that all we need to re-invigorate our visual language regarding climate change is a fresh aesthetic perspective, using the creative talents of artists to develop “fresh understandings” of environmental issues (Ridgeway 2009). In 2006, for example, the Cape Farewell project brought visual artists and writers to the Arctic to create new types of creative engagement with current scientific research and the northern landscape, resulting in educational exhibitions and publications (Buckland 2006).      While projects like Cape Farewell offer an interesting step in a new direction, I think there are still echoes of old dialogues emerging in art projects like this. There is certainly value to the collaborative nature and collective discussion of these events, but projects like Cape Farewell still seem to navigate in a familiar landscape, where climate change is defined as occurring in remote realms within a context of nostalgia for lost or altered natural ecosystems (Jasanoff 2005, Doyle 2007, Remillard 2011).  74      Even if art projects can develop new visual strategies for engagement and representation with climate issues, these images will likely not crossover successfully into journalistic frameworks, which operate using different sets of criteria for images and illustrations. While presenting overused, generic illustrations may be a losing strategy for media outlets and other types of organizations, I’m uncertain how new forms of visual representation can be utilized or created for this type of content.      Perhaps our visual language concerning climate change may eventually become more hybridized, reflecting not only our increasingly “human weather” climate (Hulme 2009a), but also the user-oriented, participatory tone of many visual experiments in the digital realm. Optimally, we could apply the “re-mix” spirit of digital engagement to climate change, with greater encouragement of messy, personalized responses to the issue.      Certainly, contemporary discourse could benefit from some questioning of the deeper narratives attached to our understanding of climate change. Our presentation of climate change content currently appears to be in lock-step, rigidly linked to scientific research and public policy that is “strip[ped]…of cultural anchors and ideological meanings” (Hulme 2009b, 355).       Perhaps it is time to develop new narratives, conceding that our focus has been restrained by our efforts to remain impartial and sustain public urgency. In examining an overlooked area of research, I’ve attempted to create a type of “patchwork” narrative, in an effort to contribute to more complex, nuanced discussions of climate change. Developing a cross- disciplinary, “bricolage” approach to this research may offer new insights and opportunities (Benjamin 2002, Sontag 2001). After decades of discourse moderated by objective perspectives and detached observation, it may be valuable to incorporate more unorthodox  75 methods into the mix, in order to comprehend how our understandings of climate change are framed, shaped, and presented.  76 BIBLIOGRAPHY  Adam, David. 2007. “World poised to sign climate deal.” The Guardian.

Acknowledgements  I would like to first acknowledge my primary advisor, Dr. Mary Lynn Young at the Graduate School of Journalism, University of British Columbia.  Young‟s ability to offer constructive criticism and soften concerns throughout each stage of this project was highly appreciated.  I would also like to acknowledge the assistance of my secondary advisor, Dr. Steve Morgan at the School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia.  His keen interest and insights into healthcare policy matters have been integral to this study‟s development.  Finally, for her time and willingness to teach me how to conduct a content analysis, I would like to extend thanks to Dr. Anne Marie Nicol, Centre for Health and Environment Research (CHER) at the University of British Columbia. viii  Dedication   For all the cups of coffee, and for all the warm support, I dedicate this thesis to my family, Don, Janet, and Alana Blackadar, and the greatest constant in my life, William Gallagher. I would also like to dedicate this thesis to my fellow graduates, as well as the professors and staff at the University of British Columbia‟s Graduate School of Journalism, a group of individuals that have the capacity to offer edits and hugs with equal vigour. 1   1 Introduction  This thesis assesses American print media coverage of Canada‟s health care system, Medicare, and the United Kingdom‟s National Health Service (NHS) during the introduction and implementation of recent US healthcare reforms (January 2008 through to the first quarter of 2010).  More specifically, it examines the accuracy, fairness, and completeness of US news coverage through a detailed qualitative and quantitative content analysis of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.  This study is important at this time, as it coincides with a defining moment in US history – the introduction (and implementation) of health policy change.  In 2008, close to forty six million people in the United States lacked any form of health insurance and medical bills were the second major cause of personal bankruptcy (Marmor, “American Health Care Policy and Politics” 4).  The following year, during President Barack Obama‟s first year in office, healthcare reform was placed near the top of the domestic policy agenda and, after a year of bipartisan debate, new health legislation was introduced in the first quarter of 2010.  The $940- billion law marked the beginning of some potentially positive changes to healthcare insurance policy, bringing America close to universal health coverage for the first time in its history.  But such change did not come without resistance, and ultimately, compromise.  The new law, which places insurance companies under stricter moral obligation and offers greater insurance affordability and coverage for the nation‟s poorest, did not receive a single vote in favour from the Republican Party.  Ultimately, the legislation represents only a fraction of the changes Obama hoped to bring about to healthcare in America.  Opposition to healthcare reform in America is nothing new.  In 1993, L.R. Jacobs recognized that the mixture of government “support and dread [was] the defining characteristic 2  of American public opinion toward health reform” (634).  Prior failed healthcare initiatives include Theodore Roosevelt‟s national plan in the early 1900s, Harry Truman‟s public health insurance proposal in the 1950s, and, more recently, Bill Clinton‟s Health Security initiative at the close of the 20 th  century.  The polarization of Democrats and Republicans over the passage of healthcare legislation in 2010 suggests America‟s anxiety and uncertainly over the government‟s role in healthcare continues to play an important role in policy decision-making.  Much of the debate over healthcare reform was carried out in the mainstream media.  In fact, a study conducted by the Pew Research Center‟s Project for Excellence in Journalism reveals that “in the 10-month period from June 2009 through March 2010, the health care debate was the leading subject in the mainstream [US] news media”, putting it ahead of the economy and well ahead of the war in Afghanistan (“Six Things to Know About Health Care Coverage”). The study‟s authors further note America‟s mainstream media “seemed to focus far more on the politics and passions that drove the debate than the health care system it was trying to reform” (n.pag).  In order to gauge the role that traditional journalism platforms (specifically newspapers) played in the healthcare debate, this thesis sought to determine the fairness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of American coverage of healthcare beyond the US border.  More specifically, it sought characterize how US newspapers represented Canadian Medicare and the United Kingdom‟s NHS, which have frequently served as foils to America‟s largely private insurance-based healthcare system.  This study both replicates and builds on Pauline M. Vaillancourt Rosenau‟s seminal study, “US Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian health System – A Case of Seriously Mistaken Identity” (2006), which explored coverage of Canadian Medicare in the New York Times and 3  Wall Street Journal between 2000 and mid-June of 2005.  Rosenau‟s methods for data selection and coding were adopted in order to test the study‟s protocols and try to extrapolate change between periods of study.  Consistent with Rosenau‟s work, the present study relies largely on quantitative analysis, focusing specifically on the presence of coverage themes and various reporting dimensions to measure accuracy and fairness.  Key differences from Rosenau‟s study include a briefer sample period (two and a quarter versus five years), expanded scope (encompassing both Medicare and NHS) and an increase in the number of sources (with the addition of coverage from USA Today).  This thesis has three main objectives: 1) to provide a reliable benchmark for comparing the quality of pre- and intra-reform US coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system, 2) to assess American print media coverage of the NHS, and 3) to illustrate the overall impact of shifting healthcare policy on US print coverage of external, publically-funded healthcare systems, such as Medicare and the NHS.  The first section of this paper presents a review of the literature, followed by a summary of hypotheses and the methodological approach that was employed.  The next sections offer the results of the study and a thorough discussion of coverage trends. In closing, the study‟s limitations, particularly the methodological shortfalls, are outlined and suggestions for further research are provided. 4   2 Literature Review  This section begins by establishing the theoretical framework behind the role of media as it pertains to this study.  The main purpose of this literature review, however, is to illustrate what the existing body of literature reveals about American media coverage of healthcare in Canada and the United Kingdom. 1   In order to properly gauge the significance of such analyses, research that addressed America‟s coverage of the US healthcare system was also examined.  The final part of the literature review touches on the vast and growing body of research that explores cross-cultural perspectives on healthcare policy.  This field of research illustrates the combined value, yet inherent difficulty of comparative healthcare studies, and emphasizes the increased difficulty of cross-cultural healthcare reporting, particularly during times of policy change, when both stakes and emotions run high. 2.1  Understanding the Role of the Media: Entman on News Framing  A common theory, known as the agenda setting effect, contends that “the news sets the public opinion agenda, bringing some issues to the forefront and minimizing others” (Krippendorff and Bock 205).  Under this view, “media content doesn‟t so much tell the audience what to think as it tells the audience what to think about” (205).  Related to this theory is the notion of framing, which involves media selection or emphasis of certain aspects or features of an issue (Entman 52).  Robert M. Entman‟s approach to news framing and the power of the media served as the guiding theoretical framework for this thesis.  Entman defines framing  1  Journal articles considered for this literature review were taken from the following three databases:  Academic Search Complete, Medline, and Communication and Mass Media Complete. Articles were selected using a combination of the following search terms: Canada, Canadian, Medicare, UK, United Kingdom, Great Britain, NHS, America*, United States, health care reform, healthcare, newspaper coverage, and media representation.  5  as the selection and emphasis of “some aspects of a perceived reality” in a communicating text (52).  Frames, according to Entman, are manifested by the presence or complete absence of “key words, stock phrases, stereotyped images, sources of information, and sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or judgements”, which channel, or guide thinking (52). In other words, “frames select and call attention to particular aspects of the reality described, which logically means that frames simultaneously direct attention away from other aspects” (54).   In agreement, Rosenau suggests that “the details journalist‟s select for their articles subtly construct reality and thereby influence readers” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 28).  With respect to American newspaper coverage of foreign healthcare systems, Rosenau argues that “there is evidence that newspapers shape citizens‟ perception and opinions by cueing the coverage” (27).  Consequently, she maintains, there is good reason to believe that Canada‟s national image on the global stage is influenced, to some extent, by the media (27).  The same speculation could arguably be applied to American newspaper coverage of the UK.  Entman‟s position on the relationship between news framing and journalistic objectivity is of particular interest to this study.   According to Entman, the formulaic norm of journalistic objectivity does not guarantee balanced reporting.  Instead, he states, journalists “frequently allow the most skilful media manipulators to impose their dominant frames on the news” which subsequently leads to reporting that “prevents most audience members from making a balanced assessment of a situation” (56).  For the purposes of this analysis, the media was understood to be both knowingly and, more often, unintentionally influenced by external forces, particularly politicians and special interest groups.  As a result, it was anticipated that the viewpoints and stories of „media manipulators‟ would be highlighted in US news coverage and lead to the 6  dominance of particular news frames (and coverage themes) in American reporting of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems. 2.2 American Media Representation of Canada’s Healthcare System   Over the past decade, there have been several key academic studies on American media coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system: Pauline M. Vaillancourt Rosenau‟s “U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System – A Case of Seriously Mistaken Identity?” 2006; Christopher M. Belch‟s “A View from Abroad: An Analysis of Canadian Coverage in U.S. Newspapers” 2004; and Theodore R. Marmor‟s “Fact and Fiction: The Medicare „Crisis‟ Seen From the US” 2000.  These scholars focused on several areas of study, including the limited nature of US coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system, the quality of reporting (accuracy, completeness, balance, and tone), and the representation of key themes, such as wait times.  They approached areas of research using different methodologies, varying from qualitative and quantitative content analysis through to an isolated case study.  The diversity of their findings reflects the methodological approach as well as period differences and the application of different theoretical frameworks.  Rosenau‟s study, a content analysis of five and a half years of newspaper coverage of thirty-eight articles from the New York Times and twelve from the Wall Street Journal, provides the greatest insight into American print media coverage of Canadian healthcare to date. Her aim was to determine the fairness, accuracy, and completeness of US coverage.  Overall, she found substantial gaps in knowledge, which led her to conclude that “US newspaper reporting on the topic of the Canadian health system in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal is poor”, and that “the complex reality of the Canadian health system would be better understood in the U.S. if coverage were fairer, more accurate, more complete, and not so often a source of 7  confusion, oversimplification, omission, and error” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 44-45).  Rosenau found that coverage relied heavily on anecdotal information and tended to over- simplify variation between the provincially administered healthcare systems, particularly with respect to coverage of Quebec (a province neglected almost entirely by the NYT and WSJ over the study period of half a decade).  She further noted that reporters often focused on controversial issues or ongoing healthcare themes, such as emergency wait times or doctor shortages.  Such discretionary news coverage, she argued, “reinforces preconceived, often mistaken ideas about the Canadian health system and does little to correct commonly held misconceptions” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 44).  In concert, Rosenau believes that these shortfalls and inaccuracies logically contribute to confusion and argued that “newspaper coverage may be misleading the U.S. public as well as policy-makers” (46).  While Rosenau‟s study added substantially to the knowledge base in this area, it also had a number of inherent limitations that were acknowledged by the author.  Firstly, the study was limited to only two (granted major) national newspapers.  Her conclusions, therefore, cannot be extrapolated with confidence to other newspapers or locations and therefore do not fully satisfy the study‟s objective to assess the perceptions of US citizens (as a whole).  Furthermore, Rosenau presents no evidence as to whether US newspaper coverage is better or worse than domestic (Canadian) coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system.  And, finally, the study did not examine how US newspapers cover the US health system as a point for comparison.  The inadequacy of coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system was also noted by Christopher Belch, who conducted a topical analysis of American print coverage of Canadian 8  news in four state newspapers (The Detroit News, The Dallas Morning News, The San Francisco Chronicle, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch) and one national American newspaper (the New York Times) over a two-month period in 2004. Belch noted that “the underlying ethos of American media exposure to Canada seem[ed] to be through sports, particularly hockey and auto racing” (43).  In the New York Times, for example, healthcare articles accounted for less than ten per cent of overall coverage (83).  Yet, though coverage of healthcare north of the border was found to be narrow, Belch concluded that the Canadian healthcare system was positively depicted and framed to suggest similarities between the US and Canada (71).  In contrast, Ted Marmor found that various publications, including the New York Times, tended to highlight differences between healthcare in America and Canada, often presenting the Canadian system in a negative light.  However, it is important to note that Marmor‟s conclusions are limited, as they stem from a single case study, which exclusively analyzed US media coverage of North American emergency room overcrowding during the seasonal flu outbreak of December 1999 through to February 2000.  During this outbreak, Marmor discovered that US reporters tended to portray Canadian healthcare as “a program in deep trouble, overcome by problems of access, cost, and quality” (“Fact and Fiction” 1).  Such representations, he asserts, conflict with data and analysis offered by independent, not-for-profit organizations, like the Canadian Institute for Health Information (1). In reflecting on the larger media scene, Marmor argues that US “journalistic interest in Canadian Medicare reflects the place of health insurance issues on the national agenda” (“Fact and Fiction” 2).  As such, “attention is intermittent, not very well informed and mostly [a] reflect[ion] [of] the preoccupations of American interest groups”, whom, he notes, bring stories and documentation  to the press (2-3).  In conclusion, Marmor points out that “the media‟s 9  commitment to even-handedness actually undermines a balanced view of Medicare” and argues that “as long as stories are the mechanism for understanding Medicare, distortion of the program‟s strengths and weaknesses will continue” (3).  Such an analysis, though helpful on a national level, is somewhat limited by its approach to media as a single entity, without regional and political variation. 2.3 American Media Representation of the United Kingdom’s Healthcare System   A search of the literature revealed that academic endeavours relating to American media‟s coverage of the UK‟s healthcare system are underdeveloped.  While there has been little in the way of academic interest, casual observation of American television news programming and newspaper editorials suggests that unsubstantiated claims about the NHS have circulated in US news in recent years.  As a case in point, in 2007, Fox News dedicated a segment to the contentious proposition that universal healthcare in the UK acts as a breeding ground for terror. Together, program host Neil Cavuto and guest Jerry Bowyer alleged that the bureaucratic nature of state run health care invites terror (Bennet).  The segment, in which Bowyer proposed that doctor shortages in the UK have paved the way for increased physician recruitment from Muslim nations, juxtaposed images of explosives and car bombs with patients receiving MRIs, an ironic comment on Fox’s commitment to their trademarked slogan: fair and balanced (Your World).  With the onset of Obama‟s push for reforming healthcare insurance coverage in the US, the debate over state-run healthcare remerged in public view, and myths about the NHS circulated in American news coverage once more.  While the existence of widespread inaccuracy in news coverage of the NHS cannot yet be confirmed by academic reports, observations by UK journalists reveal that misrepresentation of the NHS did occur during this timeframe.  In August, 10  2009, for example, journalist Raphael Satter of HuffPost Social News wrote that criticism of the NHS “stung Britain‟s left-leaning Labour government” so hard that the “Department of Health took the unusual step of contacting The Associated Press” to rebut “what it said were misconceptions about the NHS being bandied about in the U.S. media” (n.pag).  In summary, this literature review reveals that more formal studies are required to determine the true nature of US coverage of the NHS, and whether reporting inaccuracies pervade outside of narrow observation of selected news reports – an objective of this particular study. 2.4 American Media Representation of US Healthcare  A number of scholars (Limor Peer et. al, Trudy Lieberman, Gary Schwitzer, and Melinda Voss) have studied healthcare reportage in the United States over the last decade.  A main finding of their studies relates to the overall nature and changing quality of healthcare coverage in the US in recent years, and suggests a general bias towards influence of external factors, such as the economy and industry demands, on reporting scope and complexity (Schwitzer 11). Limor Peer et al. argue that the broad category of health/fitness/medicine receives limited coverage in American newspapers.  In “The daily diet of news: Variation in newspaper content” (2000), the authors examined the average allocation of news content (quantified by story space) devoted to particular topics, and explored how market characteristics (such as circulation, competition, ownership, and literacy) impact categorical emphasis (5).  The authors determined, through the categorization of a week of content from 101 daily newspapers, that the combined topic of health/fitness/medicine represented just over three per cent of all story space in newspapers (18).  The market characteristic that had a significant impact on space devoted to this particular category was region, with the northeast and Midwest regions of the US devoting the most relative space, followed by the west and south (13).  In contrast, nearly a quarter of all story 11  space was devoted to sports, followed by politics/government at eighteen per cent and business and crime at eight per cent each (18).  With specific reference to healthcare journalism, Trudy Lieberman argues that “there are plenty of good, hardworking reporters on the healthcare beat” in America, but affirms that there are too many cases where the media actively undermine trust in healthcare (“Trustworthy Information: The Role of the Media” 115).  The deterioration of US trust in healthcare fostered by the media happens, she says, “in identifiable ways and for understandable, if not laudable, reasons”, with industry norms and pressures influencing the ability of journalists to accurately report health and healthcare news (115).  Together with the time-sensitive nature of news, Lieberman cites journalism culture – the way journalists are trained to look at and write about particular issues – as another factor that leads to inaccurate and unreliable examples of healthcare reporting (115-117).  In an effort to demonstrate her claim, Lieberman refers to a study that she conducted in 2002, where she examined 127 articles from major US newspapers, exploring the congressional debate over adding a prescription drug benefit to America‟s Medicare program. Lieberman discovered that the vast majority of articles focused on the political angle: “Reporters piled quote upon quote from Democrats, Republicans, the Speaker of the House, and the leaders of the Senate and offered various prognostications about which political party would benefit more, if the drug bill were passed or if it were killed” (117).  Only a few articles, she states, examined the human angle, looking at how the bill would have impacted the people it was intended for (117).  In summary, Lieberman believes that as a result of standard journalism practice, some US media outlets “fail to provide readers or viewers with the accurate information they need”, or provide “too much information that is misleading, unreliable, or simply useless” (115). 12   HealthNewsReview.org, launched in 2006 and led by Gary Schwitzer, provides greater insight into the overall quality of health journalism in America today.  Using a standardized rating system, reviewers from the fields of journalism, medicine, health services research and public health asses the accuracy, balance, and completeness of online health stories from a wide range of news outlets, including the NY Times, WSJ, and USA Today. 2   The site is largely critical of health stories on medical treatments, tests, products, and procedures, illustrating that the quality of health journalism in the US stands to be improved.  Factors, particularly journalistic and economic, influence the ability of journalists to report health and healthcare news.  Melinda Voss‟s 2002 study “Checking the Pulse”, which examined self-perceived reporting ability among health journalists in five Midwestern states, stands as evidence that inadequate training of healthcare reporters may negatively impact the state of healthcare journalism in the US.  A large number of respondents in Voss‟s study found that understanding key health issues, putting health news in context, producing balanced stories on deadline, and interpreting statistics was “sometimes to nearly always difficult” (1159).  Such concerns, Voss suggests, stem from inadequate training, pointing to the fact that nearly 83 per cent of respondents reported having received no training for covering health news (1158).  In 2009, the Kaiser Family Foundation, a US-based private non-profit organization that focuses on matters related to American healthcare, issued a report exploring the state of health journalism in the US, focusing specifically on how recent changes in American newsrooms are affecting coverage.  It noted that in the last three years, cuts in budget and staff have led to  2  HealthNewsReview.org examines daily online news stories from: USA Today, Wall Street Journal, NY Times, LA Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Houston Chronicle, Arizona Republic, Denver Post, and the Dallas Morning News. Also checked daily: National Public Radio health & science page, Reader's Digest.com health news page, MSNBC.com health news section, CNN.com health news section, WebMD health news section. Checked weekly: websites of news magazines Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report. 13  several troubling trends in US health journalism, including 1) “An emphasis on stories that can be produced quickly – often meaning more stories on medical studies, and sometimes sacrificing on quality”; 2) “Fewer in-depth or complex stories, especially about health policy, and more „hyper local‟ stories along with stories variously described as lifestyle, consumer, or news-you- can-use”; 3) “Reliance on stories produced and syndicated elsewhere, by non-traditional news sources”; 4) “The influence of commercial interest on health news” (Schwitzer 9).  The study also found that the topic of health policy receives far less coverage than other stories related to health, noting that out of all journalism platforms, the traditional (and declining) platform of newspaper provides the greatest coverage of health policy (11). 2.5 The Value of Cross-National Health Policy Research in Media Reporting  As Ted Marmor has noted, “times of policy change increase the demand for new ideas – or at least new means to old ends” (“Comparative Perspectives and Policy Learning in the World of Health Care” 4).  In the late 1980s and early 90s there was increased academic, media, and public interest in America in examples of successful healthcare reform in other nations, particularly Canada (Hamburger et al. 5).  With this interest emerged extensive commentary that may have inhibited accurate assessment and understanding of foreign healthcare at large.  A study conducted by Christopher Potter and Janet Porter, which explored the perpetuation of stereotypes and myths of UK‟s healthcare system in American culture, enforces this view.  In “American Perceptions of the British National Health Service: Five Myths” (1989), Potter and Porter examined five myths thought to be commonly held by Americans about the British National Health Service.  Each myth, chosen on the basis of discussions with students, health service professionals, academics, and citizens during Potter‟s two-year placement as a visiting scholar at the University of 14  Minnesota, was evaluated to determine its factual accuracy.  With reference to health service research and policy reports, the authors evaluated the truthfulness of whether: 1) healthcare care in the UK is a form of socialized medicine, 2) widespread rationing occurs, 3) patients have long wait times, 4) there is no free choice of healthcare providers, and 5) private medicine is taking over (342).  They concluded that ethnocentricity and cultural biases have led to America‟s misgivings about the NHS and the perpetuation of stereotypes that serve to discredit the British system (364).  Ultimately, they suggest that the five myths “limit the ability of Americans to objectively evaluate the NHS and prevent them from learning about the British system” (341).  It has been noted that despite the growth of US health policy research into cross-national comparisons and the potential for improved coverage of foreign healthcare and greater public awareness during the early 1990s, some journalists failed to explain how lessons from abroad could be adapted to the US system and struggled to illustrate the sheer complexity of foreign healthcare systems (Cano 157).  In reflection, Carlos Cano states that the Canadian model of national health insurance “could not possibly [have] be[en] accurately understood from the mix of myths, half-truths, and misleading evaluations that the special-interest groups in American medicine understandably express[ed] and to which the media g[a]ve excessive attention” (157).  The mis-use of anecdote has been cited as one of the greatest threats to reporting accuracy and in-depth social analysis (Rosenau, “US Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 34).  Marmor is particularly sceptical of the mainstream media‟s inclination to dramatize problems. With respect to coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system, he argues that “as long as stories are the mechanism for understanding Medicare, distortion of the program‟s strengths and weaknesses will continue” (“Fact and Fiction: The Medicare „Crisis‟ Seen From the US” 3).  American sociologist Todd Gitlin further recognizes that stereotyping “solves an 15  enormous number of practical problems in journalism”, but also propagates inaccuracies and creates barriers to cross-cultural understanding (267).  Yet, while academics may be quick to criticize the work of reporters, it is important to note that a number of journalism industry norms are based in sound judgement.  The emphasis placed on anecdotal information, for example, reflects the underlying view that audiences are more likely to engage with reporting that is conveyed through personal stories.  Reporters must also conform to the ideals of newsworthiness, which includes factors such as timeliness, proximity, prominence, consequence, human interest, and shock value.  Such guidelines thus lead to the selectivity of certain story lines over others.   Today, the wealth of health policy research into cross-border comparisons of medical systems has only grown larger, and arguably led to increased access to information for journalists, the overall improvement of reporting quality, and enhanced public awareness. However, recent examples during America‟s healthcare reform, suggest that partial truths and rhetoric of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems continue to prevail in US public discourse. In 2009, for example, Allan S. Brett  noted that amid all the rhetoric of health care reform in the US – the most prominent claim was that single-payer health care – “a Canadian-style Medicare- for-all system – [wa]s antithetical to „American values‟” (440).  Brett argues that this notion was designed to “stop discussion of a government-sponsored single-payer system” in the US (440). According to others, the UK‟s National Health Service also served as “a „whipping boy‟ in America‟s [most recent] healthcare debate”,  inaccurately portrayed as an example of “the „failed Socialist‟ model of healthcare” (Kilkenny).  The fact that unsubstantiated claims over the foreign healthcare experience continue to circulate holds a number of significant consequences to transatlantic learning (Quam and Smith 16  530), and arguably points to the need for improved usage of cross-national research by American journalists who report on foreign healthcare systems.  However, obtaining academic standards of in-depth cross-national analysis may remain an unrealistic expectation of reporters, who work within the framework of an event-driven medium and who face increasing pressure to meet shifting industry demands. 2.6  Summary  To date, studies reveal that US journalistic interest in Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems tends to be intermittent, with influxes reflecting larger policy shifts taking place in the US.  Most scholars indicate that US coverage of Canada tends to focus on the differences, and less so on the similarities between the healthcare systems.  Research also reveals that US news reports of Canada and the UK often rely on stereotypes associated with single-payer public healthcare systems, such as wait times and doctor shortages.  As a point of comparison, it is important to note that examples of inaccurate reporting also appear in US healthcare journalism. The current state of the media industry, particularly economic factors, is cited as a common reason for compromised accuracy of reporting.  Finally, the literature suggests that despite the growth of academic cross-cultural healthcare policy research and analysis over the past several decades, only modest improvement in the state, particularly the complexity, of American reportage of foreign healthcare systems has occurred. 17   3 Hypotheses  The decision to assess US-coverage of the Canadian and UK healthcare systems at this particular point in time stemmed from the supposition that American news coverage would be influenced by a number of time-sensitive factors, including the advent of healthcare reform, and the current state of the media.  In this context, the study explores three major hypotheses.  The initial hypothesis involved the idea that news coverage of Canada and UK‟s healthcare systems in American newspapers would be limited compared to Rosenau‟s study as a result of President Obama‟s early framing of healthcare reform in the US.  Obama maintained that US healthcare reform required a “uniquely American approach” – a vow that arguably shaped the media‟s subsequent coverage of healthcare in Canada and the UK (Lucas).  As a result, this study anticipated that both Medicare and the NHS would receive somewhat equivalent, but limited attention in all three newspapers.  Within this context, however, a potential focus on Canada was suggested by Obama’s contention in August, 2009, that Canadians were likely to continue to get dragged in to the debate, despite the fact the Canadian model had no place within America‟s proposed legislation (“Obama: Canada Not a Boogeyman”).  Reduced coverage of international healthcare plans (Medicare and the NHS) was also anticipated as a result of the depressed state of the media industry, particularly the print industry, which has suffered a steep decline in advertising revenue, sharp cutbacks, and the elimination of newsroom staff (Pew Research Center, “The State of the News Media 2009 - Introduction”). Under such increased financial pressure, reductions in international news, particularly from developed countries like Canada and the UK, which tend to produce less sensational news than 18  developing nations, are to be expected.  It was anticipated that cost-cutting measures in the newsroom would lead to less reporting of both healthcare systems.  Reduced newspaper coverage was also anticipated because of the increasing shift in recent years to on-line reporting.  Since Rosenau’s study was published half a decade ago, technological advances (and increased newsroom acceptance of online reporting tools) have contributed to increased volume, diversity, and readership of online newspaper content (Newspaper Association of America).  The online journalism boom has seen a parallel decline in print stories, which provide the foundation for this thesis.  I hypothesized that there would be the least amount of international healthcare coverage in USA Today, which is a national newspaper and less likely to cover international stories unless they have a particular connection or local tie to American health reform.  Representing a respected global media outlet, the New York Times was anticipated to have the greatest number of stories, followed by the financially-minded Wall Street Journal.  The second hypothesis tested involved comparing whether US reporting of Medicare is better now than it was during Rosenau‟s study timeframe, and how coverage of Canada‟s system today compares to that of the UK‟s.  As a result of recent increased access to online healthcare research and statistics from both Canada and the UK, American journalists have increased potential to report more accurately, which was anticipated to be observed in articles reviewed in this study.  The Health Council of Canada, the Canadian Institute for Heath Information (CIHI), and the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) are just some of the bodies supporting websites that provide accurate and timely updates on the state of Medicare – including research on wait times, primary care, and the future of Canada‟s national pharmaceutical strategy.  Also, in July 2009, the Canadian government introduced PubMed 19  Central Canada (PMC Canada), a free digital archive of published, peer-reviewed health and life- sciences literature, which builds upon the PubMedCentral (PMC) archive in the US (Canadian Institute for Health Information, “Canada Joins International Efforts to Provide Access to Health Research”).3  The burgeoning availability of, and increased access to on-line healthcare research in the UK has also been a factor in recent years.  In 2007, for example, UK PubMed Central was launched.  The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, a health technology agency, and the King‟s Fund, an independent charitable organization, also serve as online repositories of research and health policy analysis in the UK.  Perhaps related to improvements in online resources, reporters increasingly rely on obtaining data from the web.  I hypothesized that both of these factors would contribute to high-quality reporting of healthcare in Canada and the UK in US newspapers.  The final hypothesis tested in this study involved exploring whether external factors, particularly the advent of America‟s healthcare reform and the global economic downturn, influenced coverage themes.  This study also anticipated that a number of themes that emerged during Rosenau’s study, such as “ongoing problems paying for universal health care coverage”, “waiting lines for treatment”, “privatization of healthcare”, and “doctor shortages/too few specialists” would remain pertinent issues in more recent coverage of Canada’s Medicare system, and would also feature prominently in coverage of Britain’s NHS (“US Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 34).  The carry-over of past themes was anticipated because such matters represent contentious issues that continue to garner attention from politicians and the public in Canada and the UK.  3  PubMed Central Canada is a three-way partnership between the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the National Research Council's Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (NRC-CISTI), and the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). 20   It was further anticipated that a significant percentage of American articles on Medicare and the NHS would deal with fiscal matters, due, in part, to the economic downturn, but also reflecting the characterization of American healthcare reform as a cost-control measure under the Obama administration (Whitesides).  The reform bill, for example, was pushed forward as one of the most significant efforts to reduce the US deficit since the 1990s, and was predicted, once passed, to cut the US federal deficit by $138 billion over a decade (“US healthcare bill „will reduce deficit by $138bn‟”).  US coverage of single-payer systems, like Medicare and the NHS, was thus expected to reflect the political rhetoric surrounding US healthcare reform, with articles placing emphasis on the financial perspective. 21   4 Methodology The methodology followed in this thesis substantially replicated that used by Rosenau in order to foster comparisons between the two studies.  However, in order to accommodate the expanded scope and objectives of the thesis, a number of modifications were introduced.  Salient elements of methodology are summarized in the following sections. 4.1 Study Scope  As noted above, this study expanded on Rosenau‟s work in order to accommodate changes that have occurred to the socio-political landscape since the beginning of the 21 st  century and to expand the level of understanding of this subject area.  The present study differs from Rosenau‟s work in three significant ways, which are described below.  TIME FRAME AND DURATION   This study spans the period from January 2008 to the end of March 2010 (two and a quarter years), approximately half the period examined in Rosenau‟s study (five and a half years from January 2000 – mid-June 2005).  The narrowed timeframe was chosen deliberately, to satisfy the objective of this thesis to appraise US newspaper coverage at a defining moment in US history – the introduction (and implementation) of fundamental health policy change. NEWSPAPER SOURCES  In addition to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, carefully selected by Rosenau as publications that offer political balance, this thesis included articles from one of America‟s highest circulating national papers, USA Today.  By doing so, it provides greater insight into how other factors, such as audience and corporate culture, influence newspaper coverage.  It is worth noting that both the NYT and WSJ were also chosen by Rosenau on the basis that they were two 22  of the top three highest circulating newspapers in the US, and because “they have a reputation for reliable, accurate journalism” (Rosenau, “U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 27). INCORPORATION OF THE NHS  This thesis seeks to fill a significant gap in the literature by examining US print coverage of the United Kingdom‟s National Healthcare Service (NHS) in addition to Medicare.  The NHS was chosen over other foreign healthcare systems because, like Canadian Medicare, it has served as a foil to America‟s largely private insurance based system. 4.2  Data Collection 4.2.1 Database and Search Terms  This thesis sourced articles using Factiva, a database owned by Dow Jones & Company. Factiva was chosen over LexisNexis Academic Universe, the database employed by Rosenau, because it provides full-text article access for all three publications (NYT, WSJ, and USAT), unlike LexisNexis, which only aggregates abstracts, not full articles from The Wall Street Journal. 4   In order to optimize sampling consistency, Rosenau‟s search terms (“Canada” in combination with health care, health system, health policy, Medicare, hospital, doctor, and physician), were maintained for the Canadian part of this study. 5   While the terms applying to healthcare were also used for the UK search, the location was duly adjusted to include, and  4  Librarians at the University of British Columbia suggested that using different databases would not make a significant difference to research findings. 5  Canadian search set: Canad* AND (health care OR health system OR health policy OR medicare OR hospital* OR doctor* OR physician*) 23  separately list the four regions (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) where single- payer publically funded healthcare applies in the UK. 6  4.2.2 Inclusion Criteria  Materials for this study were selected on the basis of Rosenau‟s three inclusion criteria: form, word count, and extensive coverage. FORM Like Rosenau‟s study, the purpose of the present study was to determine if US news reporting was fair, accurate, and complete.  The study was therefore limited to news articles, while “letters to the editor, opinion essays, commentaries, and obituaries were excluded” (Rosenau, “U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 29). WORD COUNT  While it is worth noting that articles of a shorter length can, and are often influential, Rosenau‟s decision to only retain articles that were a minimum of 500 words was maintained for the purposes of this study to foster accurate comparisons.  A length of 500 words was chosen by Rosenau on the rationale that “an article would have to be of substantial depth and length to be significant in forming public opinion” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 29). EXTENSIVE COVERAGE  Finally, articles where “the Canadian health system did not play an important role in an article” were not included in Rosenau‟s study (29).  In other words, if the article did not substantially consider information about the Canadian healthcare system, it was eliminated from  6  UK search set: (England OR Scotland OR Wales OR Ireland OR NHS OR United Kingdom OR UK OR British OR Britain) AND (health care OR health system OR health policy OR medicare OR hospital OR doctor OR physician). 24  Rosenau‟s and, by extension, from my analysis (30).  For the purpose of this thesis, detailed article summaries provided the basis for determining whether articles were substantive or not. As a case in point, several articles cited Canadian studies on general healthcare matters (such as hip fracture rates), but were excluded because they did not deal with the Canadian healthcare system per se.  Finally, because this study aimed to explore how US newspapers framed and used the Canadian and UK healthcare systems as a discursive tool to inform citizens regarding proposed U.S. health care policy changes, articles that dealt, perhaps only marginally, with the two systems in the context of US healthcare reform were retained for analysis. 4.3 Sample Size  As shown in Table 4.3a on the following page, the search of Factiva yielded a total of 4033 articles. However, while 614 dealt with the Canadian and UK healthcare systems at some level, only 28 (6 on the Canadian healthcare system and 22 on the NHS) met the combined inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis.  After eliminating over 4000 articles on the basis that they did not meet one or more of Rosenau‟s inclusion criteria, 28 articles were retained for analysis. 25  Table 4.3a: Summary of Database Search Outcomes Table 4.3a: Summary of Database Search Outcomes      In Passing Included Included + In Passing Source Total No. % No. % No. %         CANADA NYT 787 156 20% 4 0.5% 160 20.3% WSJ 437 135 31% 1 0.2% 136 31.1% USAT 174 64 37% 1 0.6% 65 37.4% Totals:   1398 355 25.4% 6 0.4% 361 25.8%         UNITED KINGDOM (UK) NYT 1630 131 8.0% 15 0.9% 146 9.0% WSJ 731 98 13.4% 6 0.8% 104 14.2% USAT 274 30 10.9% 1 0.4% 31 11.3% Totals:   2635 259 9.8% 22 0.8% 281 10.7%         COMBINED (CANADA + UK) NYT 2417 287 11.9% 19 0.8% 306 12.7% WSJ 1168 233 19.9% 7 0.6% 240 20.5% USAT 448 94 21.0% 2 0.4% 96 21.4% Totals:   4033 614 15.2% 28 0.7% 642 15.9%   Canada UK Combined   Included + In Passing 361 281 642   Included 6 22 28   Included % 1.7% 7.8% 4.4%   Many articles did not meet two or more of the inclusion parameters; but the most common reason for exclusion was content (see Table 4.3b on the following page).  In fact, close to ninety-seven per cent of all articles satisfying database search criteria were excluded because they were either off-topic entirely, or lacked substantive content on the healthcare systems.  A further thirty-two per cent of articles were excluded because they were not news, while another nineteen per cent were under the 500 word minimum.  Similar to Rosenau‟s study, the majority of articles retained for analysis came from the NYT (19), while only seven were from the WSJ and two from USA Today. 26  Table 4.3b: Article Exclusion Factors  Table 4.3b: Article Exclusion Factors     CANADA Source Not News Under 500 Content NYT 278 146 759 WSJ 116 65 418 USAT 45 42 161 Totals:   439 253 1338     UK Source Not News Under 500 Content NYT 560 288 1596 WSJ 207 156 700 USAT 78 51 272 Totals:   845 495 2586     COMBINED (CANDA + UK) Source Not News Under 500 Content NYT 838 434 2355 WSJ 323 221 1118 USAT 123 93 433 Totals Exclusions:   1284 748 3906 Total Articles: 4033 4033 4033 Percentage Excluded: 32% 19% 97%  4.4 Data Analysis  For a number of practical reasons, Rosenau chose to perform the content analysis without computerized assistance.  She notes that the “diversity of topics covered in the newspaper articles would make the „systematic application of rules,‟ required by this technique, almost impossible”, and argues further that “the coding strategies that computerized systems of automatic content analysis employ often miss topics or themes” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of 27  the Canadian Health System” 30).  Similarly, the research for this study was also performed without content analysis software.  Both the quantitative and qualitative analyses for this study were adapted from Rosenau‟s analysis, which was predominantly quantitative and “based on a simple count of characteristics of the articles”, such as reporting dimensions and article themes (Rosenau, “U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 29).  However, applying Rosenau’s established coding scheme only represented part of the analysis for this study.  In order to accommodate developments in the Canadian healthcare system that have taken place since Rosenau‟s study, and to further address issues specific to US healthcare reform and the addition of the NHS to this study, the coding scheme was slightly adjusted.  This adjustment involved the inclusion of emergent themes, arising since Rosenau‟s study, which were identified and applied to all articles within the sample.  Like Rosenau‟s work, this study appraised the accuracy of newspaper coverage on the basis of how closely results aligned with established knowledge of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare system in peer reviewed journals and government sources.7 4.5 Reporting Dimensions  The accuracy, fairness, and comprehensiveness of US newspaper coverage was assessed using Rosenau‟s coding scheme, which analyzed each article on the basis of six reporting dimensions: 1) the proportion of news events versus ongoing theme stories, 2) the role of evidence versus anecdote, 3) the incidence of oversimplification/omission, 4) the appearance of material taken out of context, 5) the presence of incomplete information due to the exclusion of essential details, and 6) the degree to which reporting leads to confusion or factual errors  7  Results were further scrutinized by health economist Dr. Steve Morgan, who is the Associate Director for the Centre for Health Services and Policy Research and an associate professor with the University of British Columbia‟s School of Population and Public Health.  28  (Rosenau, “U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 30).   These dimensions, including implications to this thesis, are described further in the following sections. THE PROPORTION OF NEWS EVENTS VERSUS ONGOING THEME STORIES:  Articles were first classified as either hard news (defined as event-related or episodic), or soft news, which Rosenau defined as discretionary coverage, “about ongoing themes or controversial issues” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 31). THE ROLE OF EVIDENCE VERSUS ANECDOTE:  Articles were further tracked on the basis of whether they employed anecdotal information (human interest stories, focusing on individuals and real world experiences) or evidence (stories that focus on facts and figures), or a combination of the two. THE INCIDENCE OF OVERSIMPLIFICATION/OMISSION:  Oversimplification and or omission, as classified by Rosenau, refers to the tendency among journalists to generalize the Canadian health care system “as a national, single payer system dominated by the Canadian federal government”, downplaying the importance of local input and variation between provincial systems (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 36).  The National Health Service, as four single-payer healthcare systems within the United Kingdom, is similarly complex.  In this study, articles were determined to be oversimplified if they portrayed either the Canadian or UK healthcare systems as a unified system, without administrative variation between geographical regions. THE APPEARANCE OF MATERIAL TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT:  Material was deemed out of context with respect to three coverage trends : 1) failing to portray the Canadian or UK health system in the context of other Western industrialized countries (Rosenau‟s study looked at this matter with specific respect to wait times), 2) implying that privatization of either healthcare systems would directly reduce and „solve‟ the problem of 29  wait times, and 3) not adequately identifying and providing the intellectual orientation of information sources, such as the Canadian think tank, the Fraser Institute.  For the purposes of this study, articles that failed to examine contentious healthcare issues (such as wait times and doctor shortages) in the context of other Western industrialized nations (trend 1) were also assessed as material being taken out of context. THE PRESENCE OF INCOMPLETE INFORMATION DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ESSENTIAL DETAILS:  Reporting was determined to be incomplete based on the exclusion of essential details, which Rosenau defined as: 1) favouritism of certain geographical regions over others 2) failure to mention important facts required for an adequate understanding waiting lists, and 3) the misinterpretation of why some Canadians cross the border to receive healthcare in the US (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 39-42).  For the analysis of UK articles, the geographical regions were adjusted appropriately for trend 1), while trend 3) was revised to read: the misinterpretation of why individuals in the UK travel to receive health services abroad (Europe or the US). THE DEGREE TO WHICH REPORTING LEADS TO CONFUSION OR FACTUAL ERRORS:  Coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system was considered inaccurate, and believed to lead to confusion or factual error if it indicated that Medicare was “leftist” or socialist.  As Rosenau indicates, “the role of the private sector in the Canadian health system is substantial and the delivery of medical care is predominately private”, which means that, although “Canadian hospitals are largely private-non-profit rather than private-for-profit”‟ this form of ownership “does not qualify as „socialist‟” or “„government‟ owned” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 43).  Reporting that made the assumption that Canadians would trade their single-payer public healthcare system for the US system or not recommend Medicare to those in the US was also deemed factually inaccurate (43-44). 30   In the strictest sense, the NHS could be defined as „leftist‟ or „socialist.‟  However, these terms are politically charged and generally misrepresent the UK‟s healthcare system.  For this study, reporting of the NHS was classified inaccurate or capable of leading to confusion if it demonized the government while sympathizing with upset or angry patients, or downplayed the role and complexity of healthcare administration.  Reporting was also considered confused if an article made the assumption that UK citizens would like to trade their healthcare system for one like the US or would never recommend the NHS to those in the US. 4.5.1 Thematic Analysis  The second component of this study, also adopted from Rosenau, involved a thematic analysis of each of the selected articles, which were closely examined and categorized based on the presence of overt content referring to one or more of the themes.  This study analyzed articles and recorded the presence of Rosenau‟s themes, as well as emergent issues in the context of Canadian and UK healthcare. 31   5 Results  My analysis revealed three major findings with respect to the quantity and quality of American coverage of Medicare and the NHS.  The main finding was that representation of Canada‟s healthcare system was narrow compared to coverage during Rosenau‟s timeframe, and that healthcare in the UK received greater coverage in US newspapers than Canada between 2008 and the first quarter of 2010.  The second finding was that the quality of reporting on Canadian healthcare is slightly better compared to coverage during Rosenau‟s study period. American coverage of the NHS appears, on the other hand, slightly less accurate and balanced than treatment of Canadian Medicare.  Finally, the thematic analysis revealed that US media interest in Canadian healthcare has shifted slightly since Rosenau‟s study, and was affected by global events, such as the Olympics and the outbreak of H1N1.  Coverage themes of the NHS tended to focus on financial concerns and rationing of treatment, and were overall more varied compared to coverage themes of Medicare.  It is important to note that these results are limited to the articles included in this study sample, and cannot be generalized or extended to publications beyond the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, or outside of the study‟s timeframe (January, 2008  through to the first quarter of 2010). 5.1 Finding 1: Overall Representation in US Newspaper Coverage  While a large number of articles satisfied the search criteria for Canadian healthcare, a surprisingly small number, only six articles, met the inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis.  This represents less than two per cent of the total number of articles yielded from the database search.  Of these six articles, the NYT provided the bulk of coverage, with 4 articles, 32  followed by one article from the WSJ and one from USA Today.  In Rosenau‟s analysis of 50 newspaper articles referencing Canada‟s healthcare system, the NY Times’s coverage was most comprehensive (38 articles), followed by 12 from the WSJ.  American media provided more coverage of the UK‟s National Health Service. A total of 22 articles were retained for analysis, with the NY Times again providing the greatest amount of coverage, (19), followed by the WSJ (7) and USA Today (2). For more detail, see Table 4.3a and 4.3b (above), which summarize the database search outcomes and factors for article exclusion respectively. 5.2  Finding 2: Accuracy, Balance, and Completeness of Coverage  This analysis revealed that the quality of Canadian healthcare coverage is better (more accurate, balanced, and complete) compared to earlier examples of newspaper reporting assessed by Rosenau.  The quality of US reporting of the NHS was reasonably good, but a subtle difference in quality is indicated when compared with US coverage of Canada.  As mentioned above, the accuracy, balance, and completeness of coverage for this study was determined using Rosenau‟s coding scheme: the proportion of hard vs. soft news, the role of evidence vs. anecdote, incidence of oversimplification/omission, the appearance of material taken out of context, the exclusion of essential details, and the degree to which reporting leads to confusion or factual error.  The prominence and influence of each of these factors are explored below in greater detail. 1) The proportion of news events versus ongoing theme stories  Hard news, or event-driven coverage of Canada‟s healthcare system represented 67 per cent of articles in this analysis (see Table 5.2.1a on the following page).  Soft news, on the other hand, was more limited (33 per cent), compared to Rosenau‟s study, which found that soft news 33  accounted for 46 per cent of her sample.  In Rosenau‟s view, soft news “play[ed] an unexpectedly important role in what [was] published in U.S. newspapers about the Canadian health system” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 31).  She states that many of the thematic topics (eg: waiting lines for treatment, jumping cues for care) reflect a general frustration with the public health care system, which may have led newspaper readers to think that Canadians were fundamentally dissatisfied with Medicare (33). Table 5.2.1a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada – Dimension 1 Dimension 1:  Articles Citing News Events vs. Ongoing Theme Stories (Canada)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year Hard Soft Hard Soft Hard Soft Hard Soft 2008 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 2009 3 0 0 1 0 0 3 1 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 3 1 0 1 1 0 4 2 G.Total 4 1 1 6 % 75.0% 25.0% 0.0% 100.0% 100.0% 0.0% 66.7% 33.3%   Academics, like Rosenau, often note that soft news coverage tends to be more critical in perspective than episodic coverage (Collins et al. “Are we expecting too much from print media?” 99). It is problematic to conjecture that a form of news is a direct reflection of reporting accuracy.  However, on the basis Rosenau‟s evaluation of soft-news coverage as tending to highlight and reflect controversial themes, the significant role that hard news played in coverage of Canada in this particular analysis reveals there was perhaps, at the very least, less room for bias.  Reporting of the UK‟s healthcare system was slightly more reliant on soft-news (45 per cent) than reporting of Medicare (see Table 5.2.1b on the following page).  Thematic coverage, particularly issues related to paying for universal healthcare, medical tourism, and rationing, 34  represented an important part of American newspaper coverage of the NHS, a finding that will be explored in greater detail below (Finding 3: Coverage Themes).

However, it is important to note that all articles contained evidence, with anecdote playing a factor in only a half of the sample. Table 5.2.2a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada – Dimension 2 Dimension 2:  Articles Citing Evidence vs. Anecdote (Canada)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec.

Rosenau notes that “sometimes isolated cases of medical error [were] presented as routine”, and that injustices were portrayed as “frequent, typical, and widely 35  tolerated” (35).  However, overall, most articles in Rosenau‟s study were also a mix of anecdote and evidence/facts, with “only eight [that] made no reference at all to sound evidence” (26).  While Rosenau notes that “heavy reliance on anecdotal information means that sophisticated social analyses, fine distinctions, and subtle differences are overlooked”, it is also important to recognize that the mere presence of anecdote is not necessarily indicative of poor reporting (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 44).  Instead, anecdotal information serves as a useful tool for reporters to highlight a case in point, or to bring the story to life for readers.  The inclusion of anecdote only becomes problematic when it is used to over- generalize, or stand as evidence in support of a false claim.  In this study, anecdotal information was justified and appropriately used in all articles on Canadian healthcare.  US coverage of the NHS was also a mix of evidence and anecdote (see Table 5.2.2b below).  All articles contained evidence, and 55 per cent also contained anecdote. Table 5.2.2b: Reporting Dimensions for UK – Dimension 2 Dimension 2:  Articles Citing Evidence vs. Anecdote (UK)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec. Evid. Anec.

One article, which explored the debate over creating a national long-term care system for elderly in England and Wales, appears to argue in favour of elder-care reform and evokes sympathy by framing the article around a London resident, who wants additional home support but cannot afford it (Appendix A, Werdigier “In Britain, a Debate Over Home Care for Elderly People”).  In brief, anecdote is used as a narrative device to encourage reader interest and 36  address journalism norms of humanizing policy news.  However, factual evidence that supports a more nuanced understanding of elder care 8  is only presented later in the article, which serves to downplay important factors required for understanding elder-care reform issues in Britain (n.pag).   In another article, the story of an upset cancer patient looking to supplement her publicly financed cancer treatment with private co-payments is used as evidence of systematic failure (Appendix A, Lyall “Those Who Pay for Private Care Are Testing Britain‟s Public Health System”).  The reporter advocates for the patient, noting that the British health service has denied the patient Avastin, a drug that is noted to be widely used in the US and Europe to keep cancers at bay (n.pag). By adding information, such as the fact that the patient has turned to raising thousands of dollars and was “preparing to sell her house to raise more”, the reporter garners an emotional response from the reader (n.pag).  Only later does the article note that a number of outstanding considerations were involved with this particular case, a brief indication that not all individuals in Britain are being denied new treatments under the UK‟s healthcare system.  In summary, while this particular story certainly highlights anomalies in treatment rules under the NHS, it unnecessarily demonizes the British government, sympathizes with the patient and her advocating doctor, and simplifies the complexity of factors that are used to review and make decisions as to which drugs should be publically financed in the UK (n.pag).  In addition, more often than not, cost is implied as the only factor weighed to make such decisions. Also of interest is the fact that in an article focused on patient access to expensive drugs for cancer, no reference is made to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which  8  Evidence later mentioned in the article included: the fact that state-financed care is already available to seniors with low incomes, that the current generation of pensioners is Britain‟s wealthiest, and that enacting a national long- term care system for the elderly alongside the health care system would place greater financial strain on a government looking to cut its “record budget deficit” (Appendix A, Werdigier “In Britain, a Debate Over Home Care for Elderly People” n.pag). 37  makes recommendations to the NHS on medicines, treatments, and procedures (based on efficacy and cost-effectiveness).  However, NICE serves a central role in another article that speaks to the issue of Britain‟s efforts to balance the benefit (life-value) vs. the cost of new drugs (Appendix A, Harris “British Balance Benefit Vs. Cost of Latest Drugs”).  The story illustrates the moral issues facing the healthcare system through the story of one man who is fighting kidney cancer that has spread to his lungs.  Discussion of the institute and the British government is framed in a negative light. The reporter expresses clear sympathy for the patient, who is interested in receiving a new, yet expensive cancer treatment (a pill from Pfizer known as Sutent).  It is strongly noted that the patient has been “refused medicine” by “the British health authorities” (n.pag).  At “an estimated treatment cost of $54,000”, the reporter comes to the conclusion that that the patient‟s “life is not worth prolonging, according to the British government agency” (n.pag).  The article further juxtaposes the patient‟s chances of survival in the UK with his opportunities if he had lived in the United States (“or just about any European country other than Britain”), where, the article states, he would most likely get the drug (n.pag). In effect, NICE is portrayed as a stringent rationing body that puts a price tag (of “$15,000 or about $22,750”) on citizen‟s lives, while other systems are illustrated as offering a more humane response to serious cancers (n.pag).  This article later exemplifies more nuanced journalism, qualifying its framing of NICE through a discussion of drug costs.  It indicates, for example, that the NHS has been recognized as a global leader for being “among the first to balk” at paying high prices (Appendix A, Harris “British Balance Benefit Vs. Cost of Latest Drugs”).  The reporter also makes reference to America‟s interest (and growing concern) with controlling drug and device expenses, and cites that US experts believe “„people see NICE as the only workable paradigm‟” (n.pag).  However, 38  the benefits of NICE and US interest in implementing cost-control measures are downplayed for the most part, as the article concludes with a moving image of the cancer victim barely able to speak because of the tumour “press[ing] on a nerve that governs his voice” and his wife, who now speaks for her husband, asking ““What price is life?‟” (n.pag).  Framed around a cancer victim‟s struggle, the article paints a picture of a somewhat heartless and cost-concerned governing health body, leaving unaddressed questions that might ameliorate that image, such as the fact that the patient is undoubtedly already undergoing NHS-financed treatment.  The article also attaches little attention the fact that Sutent, which a clinical trial showed to delay cancer progression “for six months”, comes at a high cost of treatment – an estimated $54,000 – to the healthcare system (n.pag).  Overall, the conflicting portrayal of NICE in US newspaper coverage points to the general challenges of exploring the complexities of healthcare in newspapers.  As the above- mentioned articles illustrate, while anecdote draws readers in, over-emphasis on a single event or character can lead to coverage that is slanted. 3) The incidence of oversimplification/omission  In this study, (see Table 5.2.3a on the following page) a third of articles presented Canadian Medicare as a unified system, illustrating that reporting may stand to benefit from greater attention to provincial variation.  In contrast, Rosenau found that US journalists were largely unaware of the enormous power of Canadian provinces and often depicted them “as simply administering the federally organized health system”, similar to the “relationship between the U.S. federal government and the states” (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 36). 39  Table 5.2.3a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada – Dimension 3 Dimension 3:  Articles that Oversimplify (or Omit Content) (Canada)              Year NYT WSJ USAT Totals       2008 1 0 0 1       2009 1 0 0 1       2010 0 0 0 0   Total 2 0 0 2   %       33.3%   Oversimplification in US coverage of the NHS was a factor in less than 20 per cent of articles (see Table 5.2.3b below).  In fact, some articles highlighted differences in treatment availability across the British Isles.  In one article, for example, elder-care reform in England and Wales was the focus, but attention was also drawn to elder-care policy in Scotland, where, it was noted, “some home care has been free since 2002” (Appendix A, Werdigier “In Britain, a Debate Over Home Care For Elderly People”).

The article focused on the potential impact of severe cases of H1N1 on intensive care units (ICUs) in America, highlighting results from international studies that examined the severity of swine flu cases in Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand (Appendix A McKay “Swine-Flue Wave Poses Threat to Hospitals ICUS, Studies 40  Warn”).  The article was earmarked as an example of unbalanced reporting and inadequate contextualization (1) because it emphasized supply shortages and high occupancy levels in Canada’s ICUs at the height of the outbreak, but failed to reference study results from nations other than Mexico, leaving readers without a suitable comparison for understanding the challenges facing other Western industrialized nations (particularly Australia and New Zealand).

As noted in Table 5.2.4b on the following page, coverage of the UK involved six articles with material taken out of context.  The most common issue (1) was for journalists to report on controversial issues, such as wait times and overcrowding, while overlooking what the situation was like in other Western industrialized nations. 41  Table 5.2.4b: Reporting Dimensions for UK – Dimension 4   Dimension 4:  Articles Citing Material out of Context (UK)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 2009 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 4 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 Gp.

Most articles on Canada‟s healthcare system, for example, had a national focus (six references), with passing mention of healthcare matters affecting five out of Canada‟s ten provinces: Alberta, BC, Manitoba, Quebec, and Ontario (1 reference each).  However, considering the small sample size, even limited representation of healthcare at the territorial and provincial level remains commendable.  Other factors believed to be responsible for incomplete reporting in this study, including (2) failure to mention important facts needed to understand Canada’s wait times (no articles) and (3) misinterpretation of why some Canadians cross the border to receive healthcare (one article), were not significant. 42  Table 5.2.5a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada – Dimension 5   Dimension 5:  Articles Incomplete Due to Exclusion of Essential Details (Canada)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 1 (N) 0 0 1(N) 0 0 1  (N) 0 0 5 0 0         1(M)     1  (Q) 2009 3 (N) 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 1   1 (O)   1 (A)   1 (B) 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 7 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 11 0 1  During the timeframe of Rosenau‟s study, articles with a national focus made up over half of Canadian coverage. Similarly, US coverage of the Canadian healthcare system favoured particular geographical areas and neglected others.  Rosenau notes that thirty eight per cent of articles published “focused on the Ontario health system”, while, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec were the focus of only two per cent of the sample (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 39).  Rosenau acknowledges that Ontario was a focus of many articles simply because “it was the geographical location of the breaking news”, but argues that the Ontario was also a heavy focus of many discretionary articles about thematic topics, indicating the existence of provincial favouritism in US coverage of Canadian healthcare (39).  In this study, similar to US coverage of Medicare, the most common factor leading to incomplete information of the NHS was (1) geographical favouritism (see Table 5.2.5b on the following page).  Britain was the focus of most articles with a total of 22 references, followed by Scotland (5 references), and Wales (4 references).  Some articles also had a national focus (4 references), but healthcare in Northern Ireland, which is part of the broader National Health Service, was neglected completely. 43  Table 5.2.5b: Reporting Dimensions for UK – Dimension 5   Dimension 5:  Articles Incomplete Due to Exclusion of Essential Details (UK)                NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2008 6 (B) 1 0 2 (B) 0 0 1 (B) 0 0 15 1 0   1 (S)     1 (N)     1 (S)   2 (N)           1 (W) 2009 6 (B) 0 0 4 (B) 0 0 0 0 0 15 0 0   1 (S)     1 (B)   1 (W)     2 (N) 2010 2 (B) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0   2 (S)   2 (W) Total 23 1 0 10 0 0 3 0 0 36 1 0 6) The degree to which reporting leads to confusion or factual error  No articles in the present study (1) portrayed Medicare as „socialist‟ or „leftist‟ or (2) made the assumption that Canadians would like to trade Medicare for the US system (see Table 5.2.6a on the following page).  In fact, one article published by the New York Times actually sought to clarify Senator John McCain‟s comments leading up to healthcare reform in the US, in which he accused Obama of wanting to implement a massive government takeover of healthcare in America, and further characterized the Canadian healthcare system in disparaging terms (Appendix A, Cooper and Bosman “Parsing McCain on the Democrats‟ Health Plan”).  The article mitigated McCain‟s statement, noting that “Mr. McCain, of Arizona, has inaccurately described the Democrats‟ healthcare proposals, using language that evokes the spectre of socialized medicine”, further indicating that Canadians do not have government-run healthcare, but a single-payer system (n.pag). 44  Table 5.2.6a: Reporting Dimensions for Canada – Dimension 6 Dimension 6:  Articles Where Reporting Leads to Confusion / Errors (Canada)            NYT WSJ USAT Totals Year 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2008 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2009 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2010 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  In contrast, Rosenau found that U.S. newspaper coverage of the Canadian health system was confused on the basis that at least one quarter of her sample articles indicated that the system was “leftist” or socialist, despite the fact that very few Canadian doctors work for the government, but are “entrepreneurs to some extent”, paid on a fee-for-service basis (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System”43).  A second inaccuracy that led to confused reporting during Rosenau‟s study was “the assumption that Canadians would like to trade their health system for the U.S. health system, or that they would never recommend the Canadian health system to those in the U.S.” (43-44).  While some Canadians are critical of their healthcare system, Rosenau noted that “it would be a mistake to interpret this criticism as an approval” among Canadians to adopt a US style health system (44).  In US coverage of the NHS factual error and reporting that could lead to confusion were rare (see Table 5.2.6b on the following page).  In one article, however, the NHS, while never referred to as a socialist or leftist, was nonetheless depicted as such, in part by repeated emphasis on the „sick‟ and „innocent‟ patient being denied service at the hands of the „government‟ (Appendix A, Lyall “Those Who Pay for Private Care Are Testing Britain‟s Public Health System”).  Yet, overall efforts were made to redress stereotypes of the NHS (particularly those that emerged during Obama‟s proposed reforms).  One Associated Press article that was published by the New York Times (the only wire service article included in the sample) noted that 45  even though “the British love to mock their National Health Service”, they do not want it “dismantled or transformed into an American-style, profit-oriented system” (Appendix A, AP “Britain Responds to Criticism of Its Universal Health System”).

In contrast, Rosenau identified twenty themes, with the top three most prevalent issues being: ongoing problems paying for universal health care coverage in Canada, waiting lines for treatment, and privatization of healthcare.  Themes that also arose more often than others in Rosenau‟s analysis included: doctor shortages/too few specialists, importing prescription drugs from Canada, Canadians traveling to the U.S. for health care treatment, overflowing emergency rooms, and medical technology shortages and slow adoption of technology (“U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System”34). 46  Table 5.3: Thematic Coverage for Canada and the UK 9   Table 5.3: Thematic Coverage (Canada + UK)      Canada UK No. Themes NYT WSJ USAT NYT WSJ USAT 1 Top heavy bureaucracy       9.1% 4.5% 2 Challenges of accessing medical records by new clinics       4.5% 3 International collaboration on health programs and policies       9.1% 4 Emerging innovation in healthcare venues       9.1% 5 Drug financing (surrounding issues of efficacy vs. cost)       9.1% 4.5% 6 Financial constraints on purchase of medical technology       4.5% 7 Funding challenges in eldercare reform       4.5% 8 Ongoing problems paying for universal healthcare       27.3% 9 Doctor shortage / too few specialists       4.5% 4.5% 10 Importing medical supplies to address local shortages       4.5% 11 Limitations on medical resources and services       13.6% 4.5% 12 Medical technology shortages / slow adoption of technol.   16.7% 13 Wait lines for treatment 66.7%     22.7% 4.5% 14 Concern over maintaining core values of existing healthcare system       9.1% 4.5% 15 Jumping wait lines affluent and connected 33.3% 16 Patient demand for longer work hours by family doctors / clinics       9.1% 17 Regional disparity re: access to drugs and treatment       18.2% 18 Universal healthcare preventing medical bankruptcy of patients       4.5% 4.5% 19 Criticism of existing preventative diagnostics       4.5% 20 Criticism of hospital conditions (crowding, staffing, cleanliness)       9.1% 21 Health system is losing public confidence       4.7% 4.5% 22 Canadian patients traveling to US for treatment 16.7% 23 UK citizens seeking medical treatment abroad       18.2% 9.1% 24 NHS as an international leader in prescription drug policy       4.5% 25 Patients importing prescription drugs from foreign countries       4.5% 26 Prescription drug advertising regulations     16.7% 27 Doctors against public health insurance       9.1% 28 Patients paying out-of-pocket for healthcare       4.5% 29 Privatization of healthcare       4.5% 9.1% 30 Abortion debate           4.5% 31 Changing guidelines re: legality of assisted suicide       9.1% 4.5% 32 Pursuit of prevention as a key aspect of healthcare       9.1% 9.1% 33 Backlash to negative US portrayal of local system wrt US reform       9.1% 4.5% 34 Healthcare system characterized negatively by US reform opponents 33.3%     13.6% 4.5% 35 Healthcare system characterized positively wrt US reform       4.5%   Total Articles:   6 22   Total Number of Themes 6 31   Total Theme Incidents:   11 81   9  Note that percentages are based off of number of articles that contained the theme.  47   While some of Rosenau‟s themes remained relevant to articles included in this study, most did not, indicating that American media interest in Canada has shifted.  Two themes new to this study were negative characterization of Canada‟s healthcare system by US reform opponents (one third of the sample), and, more peripherally, prescription drug advertising regulations (in the context of a study exploring television access to and influence of US direct-to-consumer advertising in Quebec versus Canada‟s English-speaking provinces).  It is interesting to note that important issues, such as Canada‟s doctor shortages and increased experimentation with privatization, which have received ample domestic coverage in recent years, were largely ignored.  However, as in earlier coverage, US journalists remain highly interested in Canadian wait lines (a theme present in two-thirds of the sample), and placed emphasis on the issue of jumping wait lines by affluent and connected Canadians.  In one article, for example, waiting times for treatments are characterized as a “perpetual political issue for Canada‟s public health-care system”, and reader comments offered on the CBC‟s website are cited as evidence that “any suggestion that a particular group might receive priority can be explosive” (Appendix A, Austen “Team Canada‟s Doctor Wants His Athletes in Front for Swine Flu Shots”).  Another article, focusing on a Canadian “swine flu distribution brouhaha”, highlighted public disproval with respect to connected members of the Canadian population (members of the Calgary Flames hockey team and their families) jumping “long public lines” to receive vaccination “one day before the province cancelled mass immunizations after demand created shortage” (Appendix A, McNeil “Official Endorses Workplace Clinics for Vaccine Distribution”).  This article reveals that a second member of the Alberta provincial health administration lost his job over the issue, a 48  statement that highlights the fact that equality remains a fundamental value of Canada‟s healthcare system. 5.3.2 UK – Wait Lines, Medical Tourism, and Financial Framing  US newspaper coverage of the NHS was much more varied, with a total of 31 coverage themes ranging from poor hospital conditions to top heavy bureaucracy, to more positive issues, like the emergence of innovative healthcare venues and the pursuit of preventions as a key aspect of healthcare in the UK (see Table 5.3 above).  Similar to US coverage of Canadian healthcare, wait lines featured prominently in coverage of the NHS (27 per cent of the sample).   Another prominent theme in US newspaper coverage of healthcare in the UK was medical or health tourism, with one third of articles (27 per cent) making reference to citizens seeking treatment or medical services abroad (either in the US or other European countries). One article cited the practice of UK citizens seeking private, cosmetic surgery in the US as a growing trend (Appendix A, Rundle “Europeans Take Beauty Trip to U.S.”), while another reflected on individuals travelling to countries, like Spain and Belgium, to obtain sperm donations because of low-supply in Britain (Appendix A, Grady and Kent “Shortage of Sperm Donors in Britain Prompts Calls for Change”).  Another common issue, related to the broader category of medical tourism, was euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, which is currently illegal in the UK, but which was referenced as a medical procedure that “dozens of terminally ill Britons” had sought abroad (in Switzerland) over the last decade (Appendix A, Lyall “BBC Host Admits Killing Ailing Partner”).  The thematic analysis of US newspaper coverage of the NHS further exposed a financial frame, which ran through nearly a third of the articles.  Reporting frequently reflected, for example, on ongoing problems paying for universal healthcare in the UK.  In fact, references to 49  the high cost of providing universal healthcare (Appendix A, Werdigier “In Britain, a Debate Over Home Care for Elderly People”)and statements that portrayed the NHS as a system struggling to cope with rising medical costs were not uncommon (Appendix A, Grady “Shortage of Sperm Donors in Britain Prompts Calls for Change”).  However, it is important to note that reporting that framed the NHS in a critical light was also balanced by positive coverage.  Some reporters, for example, highlighted the UK‟s dedication to preventative health measures (such as public health campaigns and flu vaccination safeguards and monitoring) (Appendix A, Dewan “Regarding Tamiflu, Doctors and Patients Face a Question of When to Act”).  Furthermore, on the flip side of coverage representing NICE as a threatening rationing body, another angle emerged, which, as noted above, framed the institute as a global leader in cost-effective research and one whose decisions are seen affecting market shifts in the pharmaceutical industry (Appendix A, Harris “British Balance Benefit vs. Cost of Latest Drugs”). 5.4 Summary of Findings  Based on an evaluation of the six reporting dimensions, the quality of US newspaper coverage of the Canadian healthcare system appears somewhat better compared to Rosenau‟s study timeframe.  Incidences of material taken out of context, for example, were rare and no articles presented factually inaccurate information that would have led readers to mistakenly perceive Canada‟s healthcare system as socialist.  Representation of the NHS, which was more reliant on thematic coverage (or soft-news), was somewhat less accurate than coverage of Canada.  Factors, such as inadequate contextualization and the frequency at which anecdotal information served to frame the NHS in a negative light, were to blame.  With respect to coverage themes, wait lines remained dominant, but there was also a slight shift in interest since 50  Rosenau‟s study timeframe (with topics reflecting issues related to global events, particularly the outbreak of H1N1, as well as US healthcare reform).  Emphasis was also placed on wait lines in US newspaper coverage of the UK‟s healthcare system, but overall a broader range of issues related to the NHS (compared to Medicare) were represented in American newspaper coverage, due, in part, to the larger sample size of articles on the UK system. 51   6 Discussion  Both the quantity and quality of American newspaper reporting can be explained, at least in part, by examining external factors at play during this study‟s timeframe.  I suggest that shifts in the journalism industry, economic pressures, and America‟s inward focus on healthcare reform influenced the overall quantity of coverage of foreign healthcare.  I further suggest that coverage was thematically influenced by Obama‟s early framing of healthcare as a matter of economic sustainability. 6.1 Quantity of Foreign Healthcare News Coverage  Between January, 2008 and the first quarter of 2010, a number of newsworthy healthcare events occurred beyond the American border.  In Canada alone, for example, a number of controversial healthcare incidents took place.  Particularly memorable headlines included: “$30,000 for 78 hours: Scandal grows at eHealth Ontario” (June 2009), “Manitoba First Nations outraged over H1N1 body-bag shipments” (September 2009), “Saint John doctor shortages forces weekend closure of Sussex ER” (April 2009), “N.L. Premier Williams set to have heart surgery in U.S.” (February, 2010), and “Woman sues surgeon, hospital over mastectomy done amid no-cancer diagnosis” (March 2010).  However, none of these stories were represented in US publications, specifically the NYT, WSJ, or USA Today.  Reasons for more narrow US coverage of Canadian healthcare compared to Rosenau‟s study period, and variance between Canada and the UK, can be explained by looking at pressures facing today‟s journalism industry and the influence of politics in America. 52  6.1.1 Journalistic Pressures  Examples of journalistic factors that may have been responsible for the quantity of articles available on Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems include: low US media (and perceived public) interest in foreign healthcare stories, fiscal pressures within the newsroom, and the growing emphasis and worth placed on online news. The State of the Media: Drops in Ad Revenue and International Coverage  The slight amount of coverage of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare system in the NYT, WSJ, and USA Today illustrates that there is a close tie between economics and the quantity (and quality) of journalism produced.  Over the last several years, the journalism industry has been defined by steep drops in advertising revenue, sharp cutbacks, and the elimination of entire newsroom positions at local, national, and international levels.  Newspapers have been hit particularly hard, entering into “something perilously close to free fall” (Pew Research Center, “The State of the News Media 2009” 9).  News coverage of foreign healthcare was likely further impacted by the accelerated decline of international news in recent years.  A 2008 study conducted by the Pew Research Center‟s Project for Excellence in Journalism, for example, revealed that “papers both large and small have reduced the space, resources, and commitment devoted to a range of topics”, but emphasized that “international news is rapidly losing ground at rates greater than any other topic area” (“The Changing Newsroom”). Limited Journalistic Interest in Healthcare  Complementing the impact of restrictive newsroom budgets and the decline of international news, American media interest in Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems may have also been limited as a result of lowered editorial interest in investigative and analytical 53  healthcare coverage overall.  In “The State of Health Journalism in the US” it is noted that a shift in the nature of health stories has taken place in recent years.  The paper states that “while health and medical stories feature prominently in the news”, journalists are increasingly encouraged to take the path of least resistance, which has led to softer features and health coverage that centers on topics like “exercise and fitness” (Schwitzer 11).  More recent proof of low interest in covering healthcare came in the summer of 2009, when MSNBC host, Dylan Ratigan was reported to have called US healthcare “„bad for ratings”, a view further supported by chief Washington correspondent for CNBC and NY Times‟s writer, John Harwood, who stated that healthcare is “„not only not a cable TV-friendly story; it‟s not a journalism-friendly story‟” (Lieberman, “Health Reform Too Boring for Broadcast?”). Arguably, if the topic of US healthcare – at a time when policy change had the potential for great consequence in America – was unable to garner enough ratings, and ultimately attention from US journalists, foreign healthcare coverage was likely thin. Increased Shift towards Online News Coverage   The Internet also opened up the possibility for certain stories to be selected only for online publication, ultimately limiting the availability of published material further.  In a review of online healthcare coverage, it appears that new journalism forms (particularly blogs) do play an important role in educating the public about healthcare. A New York Times blog, entitled “Prescriptions: The Business of Health Care”, for example, was particularly useful at dispelling myths during America‟s healthcare reform.  Other posts were dedicated to examining healthcare delivery in other countries. In “Health Care Abroad: Canada”, for example, the journalist posted a Q&A she had with healthcare policy scholar, Ted Marmor, who provided an accurate description of Canadian 54  Medicare, indicating the benefits and fallbacks of such a system, as well as details of how Americans could stand to gain from looking north of the border (Arnquist).  However, as cited earlier, research conducted by Gary Schwitzer for the Kaiser Family Foundation illustrates that health news does not receive as much prominence online as it does in more traditional journalism platforms (“The State of Health Journalism in the US” 16).  As a result of this development, “while insiders and highly motivated news users may be more able to seek out detailed news on blogs or cable news segments, the more casual news consumers may end up less informed in the years ahead” (16). 6.1.2 Political Influence  Changes to the political landscape of America that occurred during this study‟s timeframe may have also influenced the amount of media attention afforded to Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems. President Obama and US Healthcare Reform   Overall, the small amount of media coverage of Canadian and UK healthcare may be a sign that healthcare policy in America has matured as of late.  Several years ago, Ted Marmor noted the decline in American interest in Canada‟s healthcare system.  He states that while “considerable support has been expressed at various times for versions of national health insurance modeled on Medicare, the Canadian national health insurance program”, “[support] is less so in 2008 than in either the early 1970s or the period leading up to the Clinton reform struggle of 1993-4” (“American Health Care Policy and Politics” 5).  A 2009 report by the Commonwealth Fund supports Marmor‟s viewpoint, and notes that while, “in the past, discussion often focused on the merits or deficiencies of single-payer social insurance models, such as Canadian or French approaches, or public systems”, “more recently, attention has turned 55  to countries that combine universal coverage with private insurance and regulated market competition” (Leu et al. vii). As of late, healthcare systems in Switzerland and the Netherlands garnered particular attention “for their use of individual mandates combined with public oversight of insurance markets” (vii).  Examples of media mirroring this shift already exist.  In 2007, an article published by The New York Times centered on the fact that “the Swiss and Dutch health care systems are suddenly all the rage in the United States” (Harris).  The early denial of rumors that single-payer healthcare systems would serve as models of US health reform by Obama and the leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives stands as continued evidence of maturing healthcare policy in America.  At a press conference in August, 2009, Obama stated: “The Canadian model works for Canada. It would not work for the United States, in part, simply because we have evolved differently.  We have an employer based system, and a private based system…so we‟ve got to develop a uniquely American approach to this problem” (“Obama: Canada Not a Boogeyman”).  Other Democrats, like Senator Max Baucus, also made it clear that a single-payer insurance model for the US was off the table: “„Most Americans want to reform our system...We have to work together to find out a better solution, which is still a uniquely American solution, which is public and private. We‟re not, you know, Great Britain. We‟re not Canada. We‟re not the Netherlands. We‟re American‟” (Pear and Herszenhorn).  The early framing of healthcare reform (as moving away from single-payer models) likely impacted media coverage of US healthcare reform, and may have led to an overall lowered interest and representation of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare system in American newspapers. 56   More Coverage of UK - Special Relationship with US  The greater representation of the NHS compared to Medicare in US newspaper coverage can also be examined by looking at external factors, such as US military alliances.  In 2003, as a result of British support for America‟s invasion of Iraq, the US/UK “special relationship” was likely reinforced, and strengthened.  A 2010 parliamentary report on global security by the UK‟s Foreign Affairs Committee makes reference to the close cooperation between the UK and US in Afghanistan and Iraq in the years following 2001, and states that “„wars and conflict tend to emphasize the vitality of the relationship‟” (qtd. in UK House of Commons 71).  It is possible that American media‟s overall coverage of the UK has been influenced by this event and that greater representation of UK healthcare, over Medicare, in American newspapers reflects an overall trend towards increased US interest in many aspects of British life that have taken place more recently as a result of political war ties. 6.2 Reasonably Accurate Reporting 6.2.1 Online Access to Research Databases  As the World Wide Web continues to evolve and grow, there has been an explosion of online Canadian research databases dedicated to maintaining up-to-date information on the state of Medicare – including research on wait times, primary care, and the future of Canada‟s national pharmaceutical strategy.  The Health Council of Canada, the Canadian Institute for Heath Information, and the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) are just some of the bodies that currently have websites that provide accurate and up-to-date information on the state of Canada‟s healthcare system.  In the UK, the availability of on-line healthcare information is also growing.  NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (formerly the National Library for Health) and the King‟s Fund, an independent charitable organisation in the 57  UK, are just two examples of initiatives that provide online access to current research and health policy analysis in the UK.  The proliferation of online resources, combined with reporters‟ increased reliance on and preference for obtaining data from the web, were likely contributors to the relatively accurate level of coverage of Canadian and UK healthcare systems in US newspapers. 6.3 Prominent Coverage Themes  In “Metaphor and Health Policy” (2004), Nancy Lee pointed out that “American analysts working for the expansion of healthcare insurance [in the US] face a contemporary political and cultural environment that is basically unreceptive to redistributive social policies that involve raising taxes and expanding the regulatory presence of government, twin fears that all but tune out the moral argument for the expansion of public health insurance to all Americans” (19). America‟s long-standing interest in and hesitancy towards government control re-emerged under President Obama‟s push for US healthcare reform and was reflected in the dominance of certain themes in American newspaper coverage of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems, such as government rationing and problems associated with paying for universal healthcare.  American media interest in the UK‟s National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was also likely influenced by changes that took place to the US healthcare agenda under Obama. In February, 2009, shortly after being inaugurated, the President signed a bill for $1.1 billion for comparative-effectiveness research for drugs, medical devices, and surgery methods in America (Pear, “US to Compare Medical Treatments”).  It is probable that this move resulted in greater US media interest in the NHS, a system which has relied on comparative-effectiveness research for over a decade.  However, and of particular consequence to US healthcare reform, this study found that American media coverage of NICE was oftentimes unbalanced.  No references, for 58  example, were made to the fact that many Americans face barriers to accessing care.  In the US, care is rationed on the basis of ability-to-pay, instead of scientific evaluation (as it is in the UK). As Jae Kennedy and Steve Morgan note, “sophisticated diagnostic and surgical treatment are widely available [in the US], but access to these services depends on insurance coverage”, and, as a result, a large portion of the American population remains vulnerable (698-699). Essentially, the contrasting portrayal of rationed healthcare treatment and services in the UK with the medical options available in the US misconstrues the reality of the complex nature of healthcare administration and coverage in both countries. 59   7 Conclusion  As this study reveals, three of America‟s most widely circulated newspapers, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, dedicated more space to coverage of the NHS than Medicare, a system that received less coverage between 2008 and the first quarter of 2010 compared to Rosenau‟s study timeframe.  However, overall, US reporting of both Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems was relatively accurate, balanced, and complete.  It is suggested that the prominence and treatment of certain themes, like wait times and rationing, may have reinforced stereotypes of universal healthcare, which could have inhibited US reception to cross-cultural healthcare learning during a major shift in US healthcare policy. America‟s rather simplistic, and often negative portrayal of the UK‟s rationing body, NICE, arguably serves as a case in point.  In conclusion, the economic and practical pressures facing journalists today present barriers to more nuanced reporting.  Yet, the growth of new journalism platforms, particularly online blogs, are proving worthy substitutes for coverage and in-depth analysis of the foreign healthcare experience.  Finally, with reporters‟ increased reliance on online healthcare research databases, it is anticipated that future improvements in the accuracy of American reporting of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems will take place. 60   8 Limitations  This study was subject to a number of limitations relating to scope, content analysis protocols, database constraints, and sample size.  These limitations are discussed in greater detail in the following sections. 8.1 Rosenau’s Limitations Left Unaddressed  While this study expanded upon the work of Rosenau, it was subject to the same practical limitations as her (or any) study, primarily that “results cannot be generalized to all other U.S. newspapers”, but are limited to the publications analyzed “for the period of time sampled” (Rosenau, “U.S. Newspaper Coverage of the Canadian Health System” 46).  Furthermore, the scope of this study was limited to US coverage and so, like Rosenau’s study, didn’t address the subject of whether “U.S. newspaper coverage is better or worse than Canadian [and UK] newspaper coverage” (46). 8.2 Nature of Content Analysis  The limitations of content analysis as a research method are well known.  In “Synthesising qualitative and quantitative evidence: a review of possible methods”, scholars note that content analysis “is inherently reductive and tends to diminish complexity and context” (Dixon-Woods et al. 50).  Furthermore, they note, “frequency-counting may fail to reflect the structure or importance of the underlying phenomenon” (50).  In other words, overemphasis on trends that emerge as a result of quantitative analysis may simplify the level of detail actually present in coverage.  With respect to this study, great efforts were made to prevent generalized 61  conclusions about US newspaper coverage of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems on the basis of quantitative results alone. 8.3 Database Shortfalls  While the tools of the digital age, including sophisticated content databases and search engines undoubtedly benefit the efficiency of the research process, sole reliance on these tools may also pose some limitations and potential risks in the interpretation of results.  The potential shortfalls of this approach were amply demonstrated during the research phase of this thesis while gathering information via Factiva.  Using the same search terms and criteria, the number of available articles was found to reduce over time.  ProQuest, the publishing company which owns Factiva, confirmed that they normally find that content available on the database increases over time as new articles are published and appended to the dataset.  However, they noted that content may fluctuate and dramatically drop at certain periods of time, as a result of contractual changes or expirations with publishers.  In other words, conducted at a different time, this study may have resulted in greater (or fewer) articles found, and slight variance in results and overall conclusions in US newspaper coverage of Canada and the UK’s healthcare systems.  The implication, in a broader context, is that the integrity of academic research can be compromised by database content dynamics that are fundamentally driven by business protocols between database providers and publishers, which probably, at least in part, reflect the profit motive. 10   This is a potentially significant limitation and risk, which researchers need to be aware of and strive to mitigate.  10  It is assumed but has not been validated, that these limitations also apply to other database content providers since they are subject to the same business constraints. 62  8.4 Inclusion Parameters  Rosenau‟s constraint on article length, focusing on articles of 500 words or more, was maintained in this thesis to foster reliable quantitative comparisons.  While Rosenau‟s justification for limiting the length of articles to 500 words is valid, it is important to recognize that this word count criterion seems rather arbitrary and is relatively restrictive and that shorter news stories can also be significant in forming public opinion.  For this study, a number of news articles that may have provided key insights into US coverage were excluded from analysis simply because they were below the 500 word cut-off. 8.5  Small Sample Size Sample size is an important consideration in quantitative and statistical analysis.  Within reason, larger samples tend to contribute to more reliable and confident interpretation.  The relatively small sample size referenced in this study imposes some limitations on the verity of the interpretations or at least the confidence of those interpretations.  This is particularly true of discussions related to Medicare where the sample size was limited to only six articles; less true of the NHS, where a larger sample size (22 articles) was involved. 63   9 Suggestions for Further Research  Investigation into the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and balance of domestic coverage of Canadian and UK healthcare would be particularly insightful, providing a measure for assessing the true quality of American coverage of foreign healthcare systems.  Furthermore, it would be illuminating to compare the results of this study to a content analysis of US newspaper coverage of other foreign healthcare models, such as the Swiss or Dutch healthcare systems, which are more reliant on private insurance.  Such models are arguably more relevant to the US healthcare policy context, and thus, it would be interesting to research whether American media coverage, as a result, is any more accurate than coverage of publically-financed healthcare systems.  In addition, with the shrinking size of newspapers and the emergence of new journalism platforms, a worthy endeavour for future research could involve an analysis of the tenor of shorter print news articles (i.e.: less than 500 words) as well as online US coverage of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems.  Furthermore, it could be expected that with the advent of staff cutbacks and the acceleration of online journalism during this study‟s time frame, reporters were met by increased time and editorial pressures, trends that have led some to question what the impact will be on the quality of health journalism (Schwitzer 8).  Therefore, a study, involving interviews with journalists and editors, would provide greater insight into how industry norms and shifting practices directly influenced US coverage of Canada and the UK‟s healthcare systems.  Reader surveys could also be conducted to help establish the larger societal impact of media coverage in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.  In brief, a study examining whether the prominence and popularity of certain story lines actually led to reinforced 64  stereotypes of Medicare and the NHS would reveal the greater influence of American newspaper coverage on public opinion during the period of US healthcare reform. 65   Bibliography Alberts, Sheldon. “Obama‟s plan to set up government-run health insurance drops into legislative  limbo.” The Vancouver Sun. 9 Sept. 2009. 15 Oct. 2009  <http://www.vancouversun.com/cars/Obama+plan+government+health+insurance+drops  +into+legislative+limbo/1974536/story.html>.

You know, many of the newcomers to Toronto come from areas of the world where newspaper readership is very healthy, and the press is booming, so why aren‟t they reading your paper? Well, because…they were being treated like foreigners and ignored and stereotyped and they felt angry about it. So why would you give your business or spend your time with an institution that makes you angry?  —Interview with John Miller, former editor at The Toronto Star   and Ryerson professor emeritus   Angry and resentful responses from readers—most of whom were Canadians of Asian descent—were what resulted in reaction to a provocative story published by Maclean’s Magazine in November 2010. The article,  “Too Asian?”, implied that the increasing number of Asian students in Canadian and American universities is a cause for alarm because, supposedly, white students cannot compete with too many “hardworking, high-achieving, humourless Asians who never have any fun” (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). Condemned also by the city councils of Vancouver, Toronto and Victoria, the article was problematic in more ways than can be fully deconstructed in this paper. However, what will be discussed here is the fact that, despite the magazine‟s claim that it was merely examining Canadian university admissions processes, and that the article was never meant to be racist in nature,  “Too Asian?” was saturated with harmful racial stereotypes that depicted Asian-Canadians as threats to dominant white-Canadian society (Yu, 2010). 1.1 Rationale  As a Canadian journalist of Chinese descent, the racist and inflammatory nature of “Too Asian?” upset me immensely and the article inspired me to examine how journalists can be trained to cover ethno-racial minorities accurately. Specifically, this thesis will examine what Canadian journalism schools could do to educate a critical mass of new journalists that reporting 2  on non-white Canadians must go beyond racialization—that is, the social process by which certain groups of people are assigned particular characteristics based on a constructed, “inferiorized” racial identity (Henry & Tator, 2002). This is because Canada‟s urban centres have outgrown the common sense language used to describe the country‟s contemporary cultural reality. For example, second- and third-generation descendents of immigrants, foreign-born Canadians who moved to Canada at a young age, and the offspring of mixed-race couples possess such complex cultural experiences that to associate them simply with one particular race or to categorize them as a “person of colour” is entirely too generalized (Habacon, 2007). Moreover, the extensive shift in immigration patterns and policies over the last 25 years has transformed the face of major Canadian metropolitan regions so profoundly that using the term “visible minorities”1 to describe non-white Canadians no longer makes sense. Statistics Canada has reported that by 2031, Canada‟s foreign-born population will rise from 20 per cent in 2006 to 25 to 28 percent, and the vast majority of them will be settling into big cities. By 2031, what are now considered visible minorities will make up 63 per cent of Toronto‟s population and 59 per cent of Vancouver‟s, with the lion‟s share of these non-whites being of Asian heritage. Therefore, as John Miller, an interview participant in this study, suggested in the earlier quotation, the changing demographics of Canada could mean that unless Canadian news industries produce coverage about non-white Canadians that is perceived as accurate and fair by those same people, they will look elsewhere for information.  Despite this reality, structural bias still manifests itself in the media in the sense that biased framing of racialized minorities is seen as a professional norm and need not be disputed.  1  Statistics Canada uses the Employment Equity Act definition of visible minority, which is \"persons, other than Aboriginal Peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.\" This includes Chinese, South Asians, blacks, Arabs, West Asians, Filipinos, Southeast Asians, Latin Americans, Japanese and Koreans. 3  Non-white Canadians are still treated as minorities in mainstream media because they are often excluded (Mahtani, 2001; Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2002). Moreover, as is the case with “Too Asian?”, they are misrepresented when they are associated with stereotypes that portray them as the “other.” Racial stereotyping in the media becomes even more controversial when taking into account the ways digital media has changed the global media landscape. In a time when globalized processes and the rise of social media means that audiences around the world have more access to a wider array of news sources than ever before, the need for accurate and fair cross-cultural and cross-religious reporting has never been greater. Even though researchers and critical journalists have exposed the continued stereotypical portrayal of racialized minorities in Canadian mainstream media through content analyses of newspapers and radio and TV programs (Mahtani, 2001, 2008; Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2002; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Stack, 2010) little research has been conducted in Canada on the role of journalism education in tackling racialization even though Canadian postsecondary institutions play an important role in educating future journalists. There is no doubt that digital media is rapidly changing journalists‟ role as gatekeepers of information. Consumers concerned with racist coverage can now resort to outlets outside of mainstream media if they find that mainstream media is not reliable or accurate. However, people who subscribe to racist perspectives in the media, and who may share or link to sites that contain such views, can still amplify their influence. Thus, in order to overcome stereotype-based coverage, journalism educators must emphasize early on in students‟ career the importance of challenging media bias when reporting on a culturally diverse society. As they do so, they must also examine the day-to- day challenges of running such a course and the emotional experiences that instructors and 4  students face when forced to confront their own biases and value systems while discussing racism in the media. 1.2 Research Method and Questions  This qualitative study will analyze an undergraduate journalism course taught at Ryerson University called “Critical Issues in Journalism” (formerly known as “Covering Diversity”). Introduced in 1997, “Critical Issues” was the first writing and criticism course of its kind in Canada to focus solely on teaching students how to cover race and religion. In recent years, the course has evolved so that covering diversity now includes covering racial and gender and sexuality diversity, and that diversity component is one of many topics that are taught throughout the course. Through interviews with three of the course‟s instructors, including the creator of the course, this thesis will explore the following questions: 1. How do the emotions of instructors, students and faculty staff come into play when implementing this course? 2. What changes were made to the course since its initiation, and what influenced these changes? 3. How might this case study be of use to the UBC Graduate School of Journalism, a school that wants to better prepare its students to report on diversity? 1.3 Terminology  I use the terms “white” and “non-white,” “racial minorities,” “racialized minorities” and “visible minorities” often in this thesis. By “white,” I do not mean people of exclusive European descent or refer strictly to the colour of their skin. Instead, I use the term “white” in a political sense, referring to the group in Canadian society that defines its culture as dominant and the norm, while people of different colours are seen to be inferior. 5  I understand that the phrases “racial minorities” and “visible minorities” are problematic. As many non-white Canadians, such as Chinese-Canadians, can no longer be considered numerically as a visible minority in cities such as Vancouver and Toronto, to call them “racial minorities” is inaccurate. Similarly, to call anyone who appears to be non-white a “racial minority” is also questionable because appearances alone do not necessarily reflect a person‟s racial identity.  Furthermore, significant economic, political and social distinctions exist among racial minorities. More importantly, continuing to use the term “racial minority” can further entrench marginalization because those who are classified under that term are seen as the “other.” Therefore, a more suitable term may be “racialized minorities,” because it captures the fact that those who are categorized as such are only constructed as such. Nonetheless, in the following literature review and in subsequent sections where interviewees or course documents are quoted, the term “racial minority” or “religious minorities” will be used because such terms were employed. These terms were used by participants in a generalized way to refer to people who have been subjected to differential or unequal treatment because of their physical characteristics, including but not limited to Chinese, Arabs, Jewish, Korean, Indians and Latin Americans. Similarly, interviewees also used the term “diversity” in a loose sense to refer to diversity in race, religion, gender and disability.  6  2  Theoretical Framework and Literature Review  This section establishes the theoretical framework that was used in the analysis and interpretation in this study. The first section is a synthesis of literature about structural bias as it pertains to representation and narrative framing of racialized minorities in mainstream media. The second section includes literature that analyzes the prevalence of biased framing of racialized minorities. The third section of literature focuses on increasing awareness of racial bias in mainstream media through the changing of journalistic practices and journalism education. 2.1   Problematizing Minorities in Mainstream Press  Media scholars have long debated the degree to which the press perpetuates racial bias. In writing about the treatment of topics related to ethnic minorities in the press in the 1980s, Tuen van Dijk (1991) argued that mainstream media do not address the problems of minorities; instead they define minorities as the problem. Van Dijk stated that minorities are often associated with a number of stereotypical topics, such as immigration problems, crime, and violence, whereas their dealings with topics such as politics, social affairs and culture are under-reported (1991).   In Canada, a significant body of critical literature (Mahtani, 2001, 2008, 2009; Henry & Tator, 2002, 2003; Fleras & Kunz, 2001) also maintains that Canadian mainstream media often construct a distorted reflection of minority groups through the use of stereotypes and biased framing, which in turn portrays ethno-racial communities as those who pose a threat to dominant culture. According to this body of literature, what appears in media reporting is insufficient for gaining a complete and accurate understanding of ethno-racial communities due to patterns of misrepresentation that are reinforced by ―slanted or stereotypical representations in media coverage‖ (Hier, 2008, p. 132). Such coverage narrowly represents the complexity of ethno- 7  racial minority achievements because minorities are often grouped into ―model‖ or ―problematic‖ people, with little room for the coverage of differences within the community.  While sociologist Sean Hier does not dispute the findings of these studies of racism and the media, he argued in his research of race, ethnicity and media that such literature ignores the changes and progress that Canadian mainstream media has made in promoting ethno-racial harmony, acceptance and incorporation in the country (2008). For example, he argued that in recent years, primetime television shows have increasingly casted visible minorities as characters with influential occupational or social positions (2008). Moreover, news stories that seem to ―other‖ racialized groups—such as a 2006 article from the Globe and Mail that highlighted a family of black Canadian sisters who, despite the white privilege of Ivy League schools, earned degrees in Harvard University—can actually be seen as positive affirmations that mainstream media is highlighting the positive achievements of racial minorities and showing readers that racism in Canada is unacceptable (Hier, 2008).  On the other hand, media critics such as Minelle Mahtani, Frances Henry and Carol Tator (2008) maintain that discourses that marginalize and misrepresent racialized minorities are still pervasive in mainstream media in a way that may not always be apparent. They offered the example of a 1999 Globe and Mail story about a Parliamentarian accused of sexual assault by a Native woman. The story was situated in a Native reserve, and the reserve was described in the first four paragraphs of the article as a place where residents lived ―crammed into log shacks‖ and ―made do without running water or telephones‖ (qtd. in Mahtani et al., 2008, p.123). Even though the case was about an alleged sexual assault, Mahtani et al. point out that the focus was on the hardships in the Native community where the accused was stationed, thus reinforcing the stereotypical notions that Native Canadians generally lived in poverty and technological 8  backwardness (2008). Evidently, the framing of this story was skewed towards making the Native residents seem like degenerate human beings in order to draw sympathy towards a privileged government official whose crime would have been intolerable had he not been stationed at such a seemingly dreadful reserve. 2.2   The Prevalence of Biased Framing: Why Misrepresentation and Underrepresentation of Racialized Minorities Continue to Exist The prevalence of biased framing can be attributed to several reasons. In an essay that drew upon his own experience as a black reporter working for white-only mainstream media and reporting on urban violence in 1960s New Jersey, Austin Long-Scott (2004) argued that the reason stories involving issues of race, class and gender are often swamped by stereotypes (in his case, African-Americans are violent criminals) is because of the way journalism is structured. First, Long-Scott argued that the ability to tell a compelling story is more highly rewarded than the ability to question common assumptions of popular culture (2004). Moreover, the deadline structure of journalism promotes speed and brevity at the expense of in-depth understanding. As a result, as Walter Lippmann also observed in Public Opinion, journalists tend to oversimplify and fall back on familiar explanations and stereotypes rather than explore complexity (2007). Stereotypes, Lippmann said, are a ―standardized mental picture held in common by members of a group and representing an oversimplified opinion, affective attitude, or uncritical judgment‖ (2007, p.7). He argued that stereotyping results from the media‘s need to quickly convey information about characters and to instill in audiences expectations about characters‘ actions (2007). Similarly, Fleras and Kunz (2001) argue that media stereotyping is intrinsic to an industry that is constructed around simplifying information for audiences. Due to the limited time and 9  space in both print and electronic news, the mainstream media are rarely in a position to develop complex interpretations of reality that capture various human emotions, conflict or contradiction (Fleras & Kunz, 2001). In much of Canadian corporate media, stereotyping of racialized minorities tends to be negative. The Maclean’s article, ―Too Asian?‖ provides a case in point. In the story, Asian-Canadian university students are depicted as being overly hardworking and studious, as well as anti-social and cited as the reason why white-Canadians cannot compete for spots (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). Newscasting in Canadian corporate media still frames racialized minorities as people who are a problem, creates problems or pose a threat, either as vulnerable victims, indifferent members of society, or criminals (Fleras & Kunz, 2001). On the other end of the spectrum, Fleras and Kunz (2001) also argue that positive coverage tends to ornamentalize minorities and cast them in roles that are meant to amuse or embellish. Building on Edward Said‘s concept of Orientalism (1978), they argue that news that focuses on the celebration of ethnic events and festivals, or emphasize racial minorities‘ status as athletes or entertainers, serve to couple them with the exotic and sensual, and to depict them as ―congenial hosts for faraway destinations‖ (Fleras & Kunz, 2001, p.146). Rarely do racialized minorities just appear in mainstream media as average, normal, tax-paying Canadians doing average, normal things. However, Fleras and Kunz suggest that the tendency to frame minorities through stereotypical and even racist lens is not necessarily the individual reporter\\'s intent. Rather, the problematizing of minorities by mainstream media is systemic and structural, not individual and attitudinal.  Newsrooms are sites of cultural production, and even though the news media tends to see themselves as objective, the selection of frames and particular narratives are often a ―‗preferred interpretation‘ that reflects and reinforces the interests of those who control the news 10  process‖ (Fleras & Kunz, 2001, p. 72). In turn, as Donald McCombs and Malcolm Shaw (1972) suggest in their agenda-setting model of media effects, what the media decides is news is what the public recognizes as news, and what is emphasized in the news—such as the criminal activity of certain members of a minority community, for example—is often perceived as what is important. Even when leaders of news organizations recognize the need to produce truthful and comprehensive accounts of ethnic minorities, it has been suggested that fair representation is impossible in mass media for several reasons. Again, Long-Scott (2004) pointed out that the market-driven decline in the numbers of journalists and news bureaus makes it harder for journalists to explore what‘s really going on ―out there,‖ while the consolidation of news organizations into a small number of mega-corporations discourages variety in news coverage. The under-representation and misrepresentation of ethnic minorities could also be partly attributed to the cultural make-up of media workers. Journalists are largely bound by the dominant cultures within which they operate, and media workers often make decisions about stories, sources and images depending on their own understandings of audience composition and what the audience considers to be relevant (Mahtani, 2001). Mahtani has indicated that when the news staff and target audience are predominantly white, attempts to represent diverse cultural experiences can often be seen as too specific to be of general interest (2001). In the case of most Canadian newsrooms, John Miller has observed that those who take leadership roles, make news decisions, and shape opinions in mainstream media are predominantly white and middle-class. In 1994, he surveyed 41 daily newsrooms across Canada, and concluded that, ―in both their staffing and in how they depict minorities in print, most of Canada‘s dailies are nearly as white as the paper they‘re printed on‖ (Miller, 1994, para. 5). 11  Despite operating at a time when the communities they cover are increasingly diverse, Miller suggested these workers are less able or inclined to access, understand and explain the experiences of non-white elites, thus they produce coverage with blind spots (1994). 2.3   Diversifying the Newsroom  James Watson (2003) advocated that fairer, non-stereotypical and non-racist treatment of ethnic minorities in mainstream media can be achieved by more representation among those who report and present events in the news, for ―until representatives of ethnic minorities become media moguls themselves,‖ they will continue to be misrepresented (Watson, 2003, p.199). Similarly, Miller (2004) also suggested that a change in leadership and diversification of newsroom staff could lead to more sensitive and accurate coverage. However, his 2004 survey— a follow-up to the one he conducted in 1994—of 37 Canadian newsrooms indicated that the commitment of editors to hire diversity is generally low (Miller, 2004, Discussion and Conclusions, para. 1). While many editors claimed they had a ―very strong‖ desire to hire diverse staff, most explained the low numbers of visible minorities in their newsrooms with, ―People of different races just do not apply here‖ and ―The journalism schools don‘t supply them‖ (Miller, 2004, Findings and Analysis, para. 5). Rather than taking steps to attract minority candidates through recruitment at journalism schools or ethnic publications, Miller pointed to how surveyed editors were shifting responsibility to minority journalists rather than taking steps to diversify the newsroom (Miller, 2004, Findings and Analysis, para.5) Without sources or reporters in minority neighbourhoods, news organizations cannot obtain accurate understanding of their different interests and grievances. On the other hand, even in instances where racialized journalists (those who identify as members of minority racial groups) exist in mainstream newsrooms, they may refrain from 12  criticizing even when they witness the production of stereotypical representation (Mahtani, 2009). Between 2005 and 2008, Mahtani conducted interviews with racialized journalists in Toronto and Vancouver, who revealed that they felt images of minority groups were misleading. One journalist of Filipino descent pointed out that ―98 per cent of Muslim stories have nothing to do with Muslim men praying, but we always use that same image,‖ and that contemporary images of Muslim women doing everyday things such as picking up their children and going grocery shopping never gets portrayed in mainstream media (Mahtani, 2009, p. 262). Despite their frustration, though, the study‘s findings revealed that many racialized journalists felt they had to ―sit back and swallow it, for fear of being too ‗politically correct‘ or a loudmouth,‖ or for being seen as a troublemaker who got the job because of affirmative hiring policies (Mahtani, 2009, p. 274).  In addition, Mahtani‘s study revealed that some ethnic minority media workers are uncomfortable with being seen as spokespeople for their particular group, and with being perceived by their colleagues as biased (2009). The issue is further complicated by the varied viewpoints within cultural and racial communities. Minority groups can be divided in terms of how they identify themselves, with proponents on different sides arguing for integration and assimilation, or for cultural separation and authenticity. Mahtani (2009) argued that ―racialized silences‖ are one of the reasons why the underrepresentation or misrepresentation of racial minorities continues to be produced and tolerated. But one cannot assume that, should racialized journalists not fear being reprimanded for criticizing stereotypical depictions in the media, they would automatically produce news that is accurate and representative of everyone from their respective communities, or that they won‘t buy into stereotypes as well. For example, a racialized journalist who is a second or third- generation Canadian may not be able to identify with new immigrants from the same ethnic or 13  cultural background. Even those new immigrants within that community could differ from each other immensely. As a result, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1990) warns against essentialist representation of minority communities, for diasporic cultures can be quite different from the culture they came from originally. Therefore, to group together all members—including journalists—of the same racial background and to assume that they would be able to relate to one another is also stereotypical. 2.4   Denial of Systemic Discrimination  Finally, the misrepresentation of racial minorities, particularly the framing of them as ―problem people‖ in Canadian media, can be seen as the manifestation of racial prejudices and racism in everyday discourse and news coverage (Hier & Greenberg, 2002). Through their research, Henry and Tator (2002) demonstrated that there remains a persistent denial of systemic racism, which is ―deeply manifest in the fabric of Canadian culture and is a part of all social, economic and political systems‖ (p.36). In addition, they claim that the denial of racism among opinions makers is ―so habitual that making the allegation of racism and raising the possibility of its influence on social outcomes becomes a serious social infraction‖(Henry & Tator, 2002, p.37). As a result, those who work in the media are frequently unaware of their role in contributing to racism, and often they resist criticism of their own practices. 2.5   Overcoming Structural Bias in the News  Despite the difficulties of overcoming inaccurate and oversimplified media portrayals of racial minorities, some media scholars maintain that it can be done. Writing in the 1920s, Lippmann (2007) criticized the American public for basing their public opinions on stereotypes, which are ―representations of the unseen facts‖ (p.85). As such, he argued that rather than relying on the press to tell the public what the truth is, the public, or an independent, expert organization, 14  must overcome the stereotypes and expose the unseen facts behind them. Some of Lippmann‘s vision can now be seen through the rise of citizen media, where the public is forcing itself into the conversation. For example, days after the Maclean’s article, ―Too Asian?‖ was published, a website titled, ―Too Asian and Damn Proud of It!‖ was immediately established. According to the ―About‖ section, the website is meant to provide a forum for Asian-Canadians to ―respond and tell these ignorant white folk what it really means to be Asian‖ (2010). Thanks to citizen journalism and social media, journalists who claim to know what citizens care about may now quickly find out they are wrong (Kovach & Rosentiel, 2003). Like Lippmann, Todd Gitlin (2003) also challenges journalists, students of mass media and marginalized groups to challenge and transform the political and economic elite definitions of reality. Rather than accepting definitions of newsworthiness from editors, Gitlin suggests that journalists should develop their own positions about what to cover, though he did not necessarily provide strategies for how a journalist working in a mainstream news outlet might do this. Nadyat El-Gawley, a freelance radio producer based in Sydney, Australia, has challenged the way local and national media has reported, listened to, and understood issues of race and ethnicity in Australian society. El-Gawley makes radio documentaries and features based on stories that ethnic minorities tell her about migration, life in the suburbs, racism and their encounters with the media (El-Gawley & O‘Donnell, 2009). In an interview with Penny O‘Connell (2009), professor of international media and journalism at the University of Sydney, El-Gawley confessed that her toughest audience is usually other journalists and executive producers who are often out of touch with the non-white communities they are reporting on. Instead, as Long-Scott has also pointed out, these journalists assume experts can explain the behaviour and needs of racial minorities better than they can explain themselves. In addition, El- 15  Gawley pointed out that the widespread belief that being impartial and objective, and presenting ―both sides‖ of a story would automatically lead to the achievement of equality and fair, accurate and balanced reporting actually silences crucial perspectives in complex issues of diversity (El- Gawley & O‘Donnell, 2009, p.519). Through her radio programs, El-Gawley invites audiences to listen to people they may be afraid of, feel uncomfortable about, or have no interest in (El-Gawley & O‘Donnell, 2009). Referring to a story she once did in Bankstown, a suburb in Sydney where many Lebanese- Australians live, she observed that tensions in Bankstown towards the media is apparent because ―whenever the words ‗Lebanese‘ and Bankstown‘ were mentioned in the news, an immediate association was made with crime‖ ( El-Gawley and O‘Donnell, 2009, p.522). In response, people from that community treated journalists with hostility, thus reinforcing the notion that Bankstown people are generally aggressive. To counter this cycle, El-Gawley (2009) argued that journalists must discard the myth of objectivity and instead, spend time to engage and negotiate with the minority communities on which they are reporting, show respect for their customs, and allow them to review the interview transcripts. This way, not only will members of the minority group be able to correct any inaccurate portrayals, but they will also feel more confident in giving journalists their stories in the future. El-Gawley emphasized that, despite the deadline-driven structure of daily news, spending time to engage with the community that a journalist is reporting on is crucial to unlearn stereotypes and produce fair and accurate coverage. In The Authentic Voice, a book on best practices in reporting on race and ethnicity, Star Tribune writer Allie Shah (2006) furthered El- Gawley‘s point by noting not only the importance of writing from a community (instead of just about it), but also the importance of research. In 2000, Shah wrote a news article on Somali 16  teenage girls trying to reconcile their conservative cultural and religious mores with the more permissive society within which they lived in the United States. Even though Shah, being a Muslim like most Somalis, said she had a ―head start‖ on the cultural background, she did not speak Somali or wear the hijab (p.17). Therefore, she approached her reporting by first reading and attending a crash course about Somali culture, history, religion and gender issues. She also went to Somali concerts and book readings, and she went to school, the mall and did everyday things with her sources.  The knowledge and immersion allowed Shah to earn the trust of many in the Somali community and to write with an authentic and authoritative voice. Similarly, KRON-TV producer Craig Franklin (2006) also advocated the necessity of research, source development, story production and personal growth in order to unlearn racism and develop stories about race that are accurate, fair and balanced. As a white journalist producing a series that examined the way people handled race relations in the United States, Franklin argued that all journalists must first, regardless of their skin colour and despite the discomfort, confront their ignorance about people from racial backgrounds different from their own, and question their own biases and the rules of objective journalism (2006). Only then will they be able to appreciate and understand the complexities of race relations, and to search for ways to frame those complexities into stories that would make sense to viewers and readers. At the industry level, another way to stop the sensationalized and biased reporting on matters of race and ethnicity is to ―mainstream diversity‖—that is, to institutionalize a more positive and realistic portrayal of minority men and women into a news organization (Fleras & Kunz, 2001, p.164).  Fleras and Kunz argue that a simple incorporation of minority men and women into the newsroom is not enough. Rather, newsroom practices must proactively and positively engage with diversity as different, yet equal, and to promote differences as necessary, 17  normal, and beneficial without ignoring the need to address disadvantages that minorities confront (2001). Some progress towards internal reform has been evident in Canada. Since August 2001, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has required that broadcasters submit corporate plans for cultural diversity that include initiatives designed to achieve these goals (―Cultural Diversity on Television‖, 2003). Such initiatives include commitments to corporate accountability, the reflection of diversity in programming, and the solicitation of effective feedback from viewers (―Cultural Diversity on Television‖, 2003). To date, the CBC, for example, has implemented reforms including sensitivity training for program and production staff, language guidelines to reduce stereotypes, the monitoring of on-air representation of racial minorities and the hiring of journalists from different racial backgrounds. 2.6   The Role of Journalism Education in Unlearning Racial Stereotypes  Another fundamental method to better represent ethnic and racial minorities in the media is improved journalism education, which is the focus of this study. In 2008, representatives from various US journalism and mass communications schools who had been successful in implementing a particular program that contributed to diversity on campus came together to discuss how these programs were organized and executed, and the challenges that they faced in implementation. The conference, organized by the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University, provided recommendations about diversity as it relates to faculty, students, leadership and research.  In the conference‘s report, Sally Lehrman, director and national diversity chair for the Society of Professional Journalists, noted that accurate and fair coverage has always been crucial to good journalism. By excluding different perspectives from different people in the community, she argued, what is being reported and what is being taught in many classrooms cannot be 18  considered accurate or fair (Lehrman, 2008). Without change, journalists are then reinforcing unconscious and reflexive ―truths‖ that are not true (Lehrman, 2008, p.12). Lehrman argued that understanding unconscious bias, structural racism and institutional bias is integral to every journalist and educator‘s toolbox. However, ―achieving academic diversity is like trying to move mountains‖ because of a lack of time for talking about better practices and a lack of appreciation for diversity‘s relevance to higher education (Lehrman, 2008, p.10). More problematic is the prevailing view that the inequities that journalists and educators are trying to address are over (p.10). As a result, the lack of diverse voices in the newsroom is linked to the lack of diversity in journalism education. The Maclean’s article, ―Too Asian?‖ previously cited, in which the generalizations of Asian-ness and whiteness are taken as truths, illustrates Lehrman‘s point about the way journalists deny the existence of systemic inequality. The authors cite ―hard data‖ that indicates Asian students work harder, tend to be strivers, high achievers and single-minded in their approach to university, and are more likely to pick universities that specialize in math, science and business (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). By contrast, white students, the authors write, ―are more likely to choose universities and build their school lives around social interaction, athletics and self-actualization and yes, alcohol‖ (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). The authors, like many other journalists, appear to be unaware that what they are citing are stereotypes. Therefore, journalism educators must step in to teach journalists to counter such assumptions. Essed observes, ―when…racism is transmitted in routine practices that seem ‗normal‘, at least for the dominant group, this can only mean that racism is not often recognized, not acknowledged—let alone problematized by the dominant group‖ (10). Again, the Maclean’s article illustrates this point.  The two students who were interviewed are convinced that not 19  selecting a university that is ―too Asian,‖ is not an issue of racism, but merely a matter of choice (Findlay & Kohner, 2008). Neither the two interviewees, who were given the pseudonyms Alexandra and Rachel, nor the authors appear to be aware that they are exhibiting structural bias. Such bias is what the Poynter Institute‘s Keith Woods regards as the ―unconscious, unexamined and rationalized stereotypes that masquerade as knowledge‖ (Perry, 2008, p.125). Thus, it is up to the journalist to work against them and to ―rise above fears of human difference so they can tell a story that is not merely voyeuristic, but unveils the universal truths within that difference‖ (Perry, 2008). Arlene Morgan of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism offers a framework to do that, because ―anyone who contemplates diversity education in a journalism classroom or newsroom must first examine the perspectives he or she brings to the profession before systemic issues that prevent an honest and authentic style of reporting can be mitigated‖ (Morgan, 2008, p. 131).  First, Morgan indicates that a ―safe‖ haven for people to discuss uncomfortable issues surrounding diversity must be established so that they can speak their minds respectfully and not be reprimanded (2008, p.134). In Morgan‘s book, The Authentic Voice (2006), co-author Alice Pifer recommended lesson plans that incorporate Robert C. Maynard‘s Fault Lines theory. In the 1960s, Maynard, a former reporter, ombudsman, editorial writer and the first African American to own a mainstream American newspaper, identified five ―Fault Lines‖ that are essential to consider if journalists want to produce a story that accurately represents the entire community regardless of the issue: race (including ethnicity), gender (including sexual orientation), class, geography and age (Miller & Hsu, 2008). By asking students to apply the Fault Lines concepts when writing stories, they are forced to confront their own biases, and to realize who is being left out. However, Miller and Hsu argue that no list ever applies to every person, organization or 20  community at all times (2008). Each community has its own Fault Lines, and both journalists and teachers need to be aware of the issues, such as religion, political orientation and immigration, that are important locally and to apply them as they produce stories (Miller & Hsu, 2008). Morgan and Pifer (2006) also advocate that students be challenged to find sources or settings that are outside of their comfort zone so they can include a number of viewpoints and cultures. However, they point out that it is important not to presume that reporters of certain colours and ethnic backgrounds automatically know how to cover their communities. Furthermore, educators should integrate race and ethnicity coverage into the fundamental reporting and writing course by devoting one major segment to teaching diversity coverage, and invite experts, reporters and editors who are doing best-practice work to give guest lectures and help students conceptualize the importance of including context and voice to complex subjects. Bearing in mind this framework of racial bias in the mainstream press and the merits and challenges of incorporating race coverage into journalism education, the following sections will examine how one Canadian journalism school has tried to tackle race coverage through the course, ―Critical Issues in Journalism.‖  21  3  Course Introduction  In 1997, the Ryerson School of Journalism in Toronto introduced “Covering Diversity,” a mandatory undergraduate writing and criticism course created by John Miller, a former editor at a large Toronto daily newspaper. Its objective was to teach journalism students how to develop a strategy to fairly and accurately cover matters of race and religion, to frame stories about Toronto‟s many racial communities in a manner that is non-stereotypical, to include stories both about achievements and conflicts within these communities, and to pitch racial diversity stories to the professional media (See Appendix A for course syllabus). Eventually, the course evolved both in name and content—it became “Critical Issues in Journalism,” and no longer focused solely on racial diversity coverage. Instead, “Critical Issues” encompassed several things: beat reporting; covering racial minorities, people with disabilities and gay and lesbien people; and critical analysis of controversial issues in mainstream media, such as democracy, cultures of impunity, foreign correspondence, media ownership and citizen journalism. The course is also no longer compulsory. Most recently taught by Joy Luk 2  and a co- teacher in the winter term of 2010, and Kali Ma 3  in the fall term of 2010, “Critical Issues” aimed to teach students to question journalistic practices that may fall short of core journalistic values such as fairness, accuracy and context, and to identify pitfalls in their own reporting (See Appendix B and Appendix C for course syllabi). Throughout the rest of this paper, this course will be referred to as “Critical Issues.”  2  Note: a pseudonym chosen by the interview participant is used here. 3  Note: a pseudonym chosen by the interview participant is used here. 22  3.1   Significance of the Course  As a former editor of the Toronto Star, Miller said he realized only after he left the paper just how much stereotyping is part of news judgment. As soon as you get assigned a story, you immediately start limiting it. You generally say, “Oh it‟s one of those stories.” That limits who you talk to, it limits your perspective on the story and unless you learn to delay framing a story, then you‟ll never get to the real story, and that needs a lot of attention (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  All three interview participants agreed that “getting to the real story,” particularly when it concerns minority communities, requires getting past clichés. Instead, journalism students need to first understand why stereotyping of minorities exist, why it is problematic, and most importantly, when they becoming practicing journalists, how to ensure their stories reflect the reality and nuances of these communities.    3.1.1   Confronting Structural Bias  The curriculum of “Critical Issues” was initially based upon research on diversity coverage that Miller had conducted on behalf of the Canadian Daily Newspaper Association. It was also influenced by the problematic coverage of a random robbery in 1994—a case that was brought up again in the Toronto Star this January. Seventeen years ago, three young black men robbed a trendy midtown café in Toronto called Just Desserts, and shot a 23-year-old white female to death (Tyler, 2011). All of a sudden the papers were publishing grainy police surveillance camera shots that only showed the skin was black. You couldn‟t make out any identifying features and the media just went off and said, “This is US-style urban warfare come to Canada.” It was sort of a moral panic response. And I‟d done a sort of an analysis on that media coverage and I said, “You know, this can‟t go on. We‟ve got to make our coverage more sophisticated than this” (Miller, personal communications, January 21, 2011).  As a result, he decided that students needed to learn skills on how to cover cross-cultural and cross-religious issues. Thus, Miller developed and taught the first “Critical issues” course at 23  Ryerson. Subsequent instructor, Luk, argued that such skills are necessary because racism and systemic discrimination in Canadian mainstream media continues to persist in newer and subtler forms—often in a seemingly innocent way. As a result, it is important that instructors train journalists of the future to tackle editorial decisions that may lead to biased or inaccurate storytelling.  It is important because [racism] is so insidious. Of course people don‟t do the overt stuff. You don‟t—you can‟t be overtly racist in your coverage, but where we‟re at right now, I think in Canada, is the subtle stuff is not questioned (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Referring to the Maclean’s article, “Too Asian?”, where Asian-Canadian university students were labeled as being smart, but socially awkward (Findley & Kohler, 2010), Luk said: The problem with any kind of racial stereotype is it can flip any way. I mean, of course it‟s better to be called smart than dumb, because some minorities are considered to be dumb, so it‟s nice to be considered smart, except it‟s still a stereotype and it hurts people. And also, it‟s another way of making you the „other.‟ You‟re not part of the mainstream, you‟re the „other,‟ you‟re the people who are smart, who aren‟t any fun and you‟re taking our spots (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Ma also agreed that racism in the mainstream media could be quite inferential. You can have somebody who is a very nice person, who is a good journalist, a good professional journalist, a good editor, but still falls into the pitfalls of creating or allowing an article like „Too Asian?‟ in Maclean’s to go through (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Here, both Luk and Ma point to institutional bias and the process of “othering” in mainstream media. Fleras and Kunz (2001) argued that in Canada, a country that is widely seen to be socially progressive, racist concepts have shifted from an emphasis on discriminatory laws and deliberate exclusion to an emphasis on covert expressions that are embedded in institutions such as the media. For example, negative or resentful comments about a particular racialized group may not be seen as racist, but merely a genuine reflection of ignorance, fear or bad manners on the part of the speaker. Hence, why the authors and sources in “Too Asian?” could easily claim the term, 24  “Too Asian” is not about racism, only that “many white students simply believe that competing with Asians—both Asian Canadians and international students—requires a sacrifice of time and freedom they‟re not willing to make” (Findlay & Kohler, 2010). In this example, it is clear that both Luk and Ma sympathize with the authors of “Too Asian?” and imagine that it was never their intent to offend people. When such is the case, Ma emphasized the importance of getting students to critically examine the socialization of themselves, to identify their own points of privilege, and to understand how their identities influence their reporting, for biased coverage does not occur in a vacuum. Instead, they are a result of many different societal processes that rationalize stereotypes and misconceptions. By discussing these processes throughout her course, such as the factors that influence an editor‟s decision to leave some stories in while others out, the implications for news coverage when media chains dominate a region, the depiction of racial minorities and the coverage of the gay, lesbian and trans-gendered communities in corporate media, Ma said students can develop a holistic understanding of how biased coverage is created, and how to make an argument for change. You‟re only asking them to think about it, and you‟re also asking them to understand that in the classroom, some people are right—extreme right, some people are racist, some people are extreme left, and the idea that will be the same in the newsroom. And that hopefully, you can have a debate that is intelligent and informed and have a way to sort of respond to an editor—you know, have a way to walk in and have some ammunition, that if you are somebody who wants to help to build a more progressive media, then how do you start to articulate that (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  Luk pointed out that the course can only go so far, though. While instructors can point out the blind spots of media coverage and can try to help students avoid falling into those same traps, at the end, the most important lesson students need to learn about covering minority issues is that it is not easy. As they go out into different communities to scoop out stories and interview 25  people for an assignment, they will most likely meet resistance from the community they are covering, and failure, Luk said. I think it makes students stop and think a lot when they‟re dealing with real people who are going to be sensitive about something, or angry about something. This is the best way to learn, is to get thrown into a tough story. And the good thing is, of course, is it‟s a class assignment so if they make a big mistake, they‟re not going to get fired from their job or the newspaper isn‟t going to be investigated by the press council (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).     3.1.2   Making Stories Relevant to the Community is Good Business  As Miller‟s quote from the introduction indicated, reflecting your community accurately is simply a part of good journalism. He and Luk both argued that if Canadian media does not catch up with demographic realities, the industry may soon go out of business.  26  4  Facing Discomfort, Hostility and Disappointment: The Role of Emotions in Implementing This Course Structural bias is prevalent not only in newsrooms, but in classrooms and education institutions as well (Stack, 2010). Miller acknowledged that when it comes to talking about race and religion, there tends to be “armed camps” because the conversation forces people to question societal norms, their identity, their privilege and biases. The discomfort could lead to hostility. Thus, for some of the “Critical Issues” instructors, challenging this bias within the classroom and the faculty has been an emotional struggle. Certainly, most jobs require people to manage their emotions in some way, such as holding back anger at a boss, overcoming fear of presenting in front of clients, or swallowing hurtful comments or criticism from colleagues (Harlow, 2003). For the “Critical Issues” instructors, teaching a course about race and the media often involved managing frustration, anger, anxiety, a sense of isolation and hurt. Miller experienced overt resistance from students and faculty staff from the get-go. As a result, his experience served as a cautionary tale for following instructors such as Luk and Ma. Neither of them was directly involved in confrontations with other faculty members and students, but both instructors felt that teaching this course comes with baggage and as a result, they had to tweak the curriculum to accommodate. 4.1   Confronting Angry Students  Miller realized early on from his students‟ exaggerated body language—jumping over things and slamming doors—that they were not comfortable with talking about issues of race and privilege, and they tended not to relate this discussion to journalism. He noted that many white students felt the course was aimed to make them feel guilty for being white, while non-white 27  students resented being singled out when all they wanted was to fit in with Canadian society. Other times, Miller was accused of trying to be “politically correct” for teaching students to write certain stories just to appease a group that is left out of mainstream media coverage. He was also resented for being “a white guy trying to be a black guy,” while Ma, on the other hand, who is a relatively young instructor of colour, was seen as having some kind of special interest in teaching about racial bias. She struggled to get past students‟ defensiveness when they felt that she was challenging their sense of privilege and entitlement. If there‘s nobody else who looks like me at the school of journalism, and everybody else is 55 plus and is white and has grey hair, then when they see me at the front of the classroom, then I don‘t seem like an authority figure. So that‘s problematic to begin with. They have an easier time challenging me, for example, so the way that students speak to me is different (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  For instance, Ma said she has had students speak to her in disrespectful tones during lectures. While it was hurtful, she shrugged it off as, “It is the way it is.” My students feel comfortable enough to challenge me, which I think is good, but comfortable enough to challenge me in a non-respectful way is a different thing… But I also—I mean, it is the way it is—their point of privilege, they think they can speak to me that way…Students do get defensive and they do feel a sense of entitlement and privilege because they are entitled and privileges in society in general (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Ma noted, for example, that getting her students to complete one major class assignment was an exasperating experience. They really pushed back on it at first and refused to work with each other as she had requested. Other times, they questioned her knowledge and the validity of her lecture material, claiming that they “knew all about it” and did not learn anything new from her course. As a result, Ma felt she had to make an extra effort to appear authoritative and qualified. For example, when students asked for deadline extensions, she always said no because she felt she had to “maintain a level of authority that others may not.” 28  Other times, students confronted the instructors outright. Luk noted her co-teacher had a student say to her face that she was a terrible teacher—an incident that caused her co-teacher to be rather distressed. When Miller brought in a guest speaker from the Canadian Islamic Congress, students accused him of hosting anti-Semitic and intolerant people. He also noted that sometimes, their anger would overcome them. This was evident during the years when he gave students a final exam, and some students wrote provocative answers in response to an article filled with problematic stereotypes just to protest against the course. However, the most shocking experience for Miller occurred during his first year of teaching “Critical Issues,” when the students‟ hostility translated into a petition that was sent to the chair of the program to abolish the class altogether. I said, “Jeez, good thing I have tenure because if I didn‟t, I‟d be totally intimidated.” The normal first reaction if students don‟t like a class or teacher or way of teaching is to take it up in class, you know? Or come in and say, “I‟m having real trouble with the way you‟re teaching the class.” But to abolish the class, right off the bat—that just doesn\\'t happen (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  The course remained part of the journalism program at Ryerson, but as a result of this petition, Miller said he tweaked the course slightly in order to address some of his students‟ grievances about topics and assignments. However, he maintained that the “opposition was quite there” until he retired. 4.2   Showdown with Faculty Members  Another unique experience for Miller alone was faculty opposition to his course. Again, he had anticipated that not every teacher in the journalism program would agree with a course focused solely on covering diversity. It would be the first of its kind to be taught in a Canadian journalism school, and many teachers simply said that the course was not necessary, and were quite impartial. However, this indifference turned into a confrontation when one year, one of 29  Miller‟s students did a content analysis for an assignment, and chose The Ryerson Review of Journalism, a magazine produced by students and an instructor at the School of Journalism.  This student examined the magazine‟s covers over an extended period of time and concluded that the covers did not portray racial diversity because only photos of white people were ever published on the covers. The student then presented the analysis to the Review‟s instructor and asked for an explanation. According to Miller, the instructor replied, “Well, there‟s research that shows that, you know, if you put a person who‟s black on the cover of a magazine, it doesn‟t sell as well.”  Aggravated, Miller then encouraged his student to challenge that assumption. He had wanted this instructor to produce evidence that supports this claim, but this example also indicates his determination to challenge the kind of racist thinking that seemed so entrenched in his faculty. However, it caused the Review‟s instructor and others who taught magazine-writing to “one-by-one gang up” on him during a curriculum review.  They said—they quoted from my student‟s paper, and they said, “This is just—this is just bullshit because we‟ve written stories on diversity. How can you teach a course like this?” It shocked everybody, you know, that they would gang up so publicly on a student‟s work and a fellow faculty member‟s course. If that is allowed to happen in a faculty, it has an effect. It becomes a controversial course, it becomes not—you know, it becomes a course that nobody wants to teach. If they want to teach or they‟re assigned to teach it, they‟ll probably change it (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  To Miller‟s disappointment, that in fact happened. When it was time for him to pass on the course, his successors declined his offer of lecture notes and research material and instead, rearranged the course curriculum. He lamented the loss of his original course and attributed the circumstances to lack of interest and support within the faculty. You only have so much energy. One person on a faculty only has so many oars they can put in the water and change things. This course actually grew out of my research and my thinking in teaching the course to an initially hostile audience over seven or eight years…And so all that was lost and it‘s really no surprise that the course changed 30  drastically after that...if nobody was interested in knowing what the course was based on in the first place (Miller, personal communication, February 21, 2011).  Ma was one of the subsequent instructors who revamped the course, particularly after she was told that students had reacted poorly the previous term because her predecessors had been too assertive about the existence of racism and sexism in the media. Ma was also too aware of how her identity as a female professor of colour could influence the way students perceive her. She had refused to teach this class when it was offered to her several years ago, partly because she had been the only person of colour in the School of Journalism then. She did not want to be the token professor to teach diversity issues because “students tend to get very defensive when learning about things like—when you try to teach something that is either anti-racist or feminist.” Ma indicated that she has tried to express this problem to fellow professors, but many do not understand her dilemma because they cannot relate. Her experience sheds light on the existence of institutionalized bias within the school of journalism. On the one hand, as a professor of colour, she was essentialized as the expert on ―diversity issues‖ and was expected to be the one who can teach students all there is to know about how to cover different racial and cultural groups in a fair and accurate way. On the other hand, she understood that even if she did possess such knowledge, given that she is a visible minority in the journalism school, students may perceive her to be threatening if she teaches about power and privilege in mainstream media, and about how students‘ sense of privilege can affect their reporting. 4.3   Factoring Student and Faculty Reactions into Curriculum Decisions: Taking the Path of Least Resistance Given the tension and emotional strain, Miller generalized that teaching this course can produce anxiety, particularly for untenured professors and professors of colour. As a result, they 31  may choose to change the course in order to meet less opposition. Ma appeared to have done as such when she revised the curriculum in 2010. Rather than focus only on diversity (which, in her case, included racial, religious and gender diversity) she also included concepts like journalism‟s role in democracy, cultures of impunity, corporate consolidation of news and the role of social media (see Appendix C for syllabus). The idea, she said, was to start with universal concepts with which students all agree, and about which they will be less likely to get defensive—such as the idea that a journalist should not be killed for speaking out against an oppressive government. Only after students have built a consensus, about halfway through the term, did they explore more controversial topics such as covering race and gender diversity. Despite the course changes, instructors did not necessarily have any easier of a time teaching it. Luk said her predecessor got “very depressed teaching it” and “everybody hated it, and everybody seemed to want to get out of it.” She also said that when she contacted previous instructors for information, they gave her a shocked, “Oh my God, you‟re teaching that?” Miller also admitted wearily that he “went through a lot,” teaching this course: When there were troubles in the course, my teaching ratings went way down because people were angry. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy—there was this shared feeling among students that, you know, there was a problem course and therefore they better rate it pretty lowly. Now I have a pretty thick skin and it wasn‟t going to affect my employment but I just said, “God help it if an untenured professor gets this course because they‟re going to run the other way,” and that in fact is just what happened (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  Evidently, teaching such a course was not simply about implementing a curriculum with a particular agenda to teach students how to overcome racial bias in their own reporting. Rather, the instructors realized that trying to change students‟ minds about certain issues was very difficult. For example, Luk indicated that a lot of her students insisted they do not see much sexism in the media, therefore they do not understand the problem. Nonetheless, both Luk and 32  Ma agreed that some skepticism was healthy because it stimulated discussion and pushed students to explore an issue and question general assumptions rather than to just take certain journalistic practices for granted.  The point, Ma argued, was not for students to necessarily agree with the instructor‟s point of view or with each other, but to inform students about controversial issues related to mainstream media so they can draw their own questions and conclusions. You leave everything as a question and therefore students are able to make their own conclusions. If you walk away still thinking, „Well I think it‟s perfectly fine‟—I mean, you‟re not going to change everybody‟s minds (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Miller, however, was quite disappointed. For one thing, the course that he had set out to establish no longer exists in its original form because it has been “erased from the collective culture of the School of Journalism.” For another, he lamented, “The [students] who decided that it was bullshit, they probably didn‟t learn very much. We failed them.” Furthermore, the course forced instructors to question their own biases and their own reasons for teaching such a course—something that often put them in an awkward position and caused them to feel exasperated. Miller, who is a middle-aged white male, said students rated his course poorly, with comments such as, “It‟s such a lousy course because Miller is a white guy who wants to be a black guy.” But I was always conscious and I said, “Look, you know, I can‟t teach this course as a guilty white guy, and I certainly don‟t feel like a guilty white guy, that‟s not where I‟m coming from.” And so I always had to make it clear why I was coming to this course, and when I chose teaching assistants I tried to have racial diversity in them so that you know, we‟d be presenting different perspectives (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).   However, it was never as simple as that, because when instructors are too passionate about topics related to their own background and expertise, they can end up being biased as well. 33  Luk, who is also a female professor of colour, said she never experienced any kind of negativity from students regarding her race and gender. However, she was conscious that her personal experience influenced the way she taught. For example, because she had experienced depression herself, she insisted that the ignorance of mainstream media when it comes to reporting on people with illnesses like schizophrenia must be addressed in class so that students do not fall into stereotypes and end up promoting prejudice in their stories. You have to be objective. You cannot be an advocate, really…you‟re still a journalist. You have to see the weaknesses and problems with coverage that is biased, but, I mean, you can swing around the other way and be biased yourself, be pro-women or pro- Chinese, so that‟s the danger (Luk, personal Communication, January 27, 2011).  It is apparent then, that teaching a course such as “Critical Issues” is not merely about the mechanics of devising a course curriculum, assigning readings and case studies and marking assignments. Rather, instructors must take into account the kind of emotions such a course will rile up in students, the influence of faculty politics, as well as their own emotions and biases. All of these things will affect how the course is taught, and whether it will be taught effectively.  34  5  From Being Ghettoized to Being Holistic: Course Changes over the Years “Critical Issues,” last taught by Ma in 2010, is now designed to expose students to a myriad of controversial issues that challenge the role of journalists, but the course was not always set up that way. As previously noted, the course changed over the years as different instructors took over.  Instructors adapted the curriculum according to their own interests or expertise, but this chapter will examine how Miller, Luk and Ma also changed the curriculum in response to student and faculty reactions, as well as out of faculty obligations. 5.1   Curriculum Changes  As previously noted, the curriculum of “Critical Issues” was originally based on Miller‟s research in problematic coverage of racialized minorities in mainstream media and his strong belief that journalists needed to learn skills on how to accurately cover cross-cultural and cross- religious issues. At first, it was a mandatory course because Miller wanted to reach every student in the journalism program. Due to student resentment, however, the class became an elective instead. Miller‟s focus has always been on racism in Canadian mainstream media. Therefore, each week, students would look at topics such as racial and religious stereotyping in the media, racial profiling, and covering differences within ethnic communities. Case studies were also assigned to get small group discussions going and stimulate students to think of questions that may arise. While Luk‟s course was structured in a similar way, her curriculum was a mixture of teaching students beat reporting and critical issues in journalism. She and her co-instructor picked twelve different topics to teach over the course of the term, and the topics were categorized under “Covering Diversity,” “Beats/Genres,” and “Other Issues” (See Appendix B). Under “Covering Diversity,” Luk and her co-teacher focused on race, gender and physical and 35  mental disabilities—the first and last of which are topics Luk is passionate about. However, Luk said the curriculum was structured this way only because she had inherited the syllabus from a previous teacher, and she and her co-teacher felt obligated to follow it. In Luk‟s opinion, jumping around every week to a different topic was problematic because some of the topics, such as citizen journalism, had little to do with other topics such as sports reporting. More importantly, she argued that this “one-issue-a-week garbage” was too superficial because there was little time to cover each topic as in-depth as she would have liked. It is for this reason that Miller designed the original “Critical Issues” to be a 13-week course focused solely on covering racial and religious diversity. He argued that students needed to be given adequate time to get their heads around race and religion, but the concepts that they learn should enable them to cover other issues such as gender and sexuality diversity. Ma disagreed. Even though she conceded that it is difficult to comprehensively cover each of the 13 topics in her syllabus, she believes taking this holistic approach allows students to draw connections between topics such as democracy, press freedoms, media ownership, race and ideology, and digital challenges to journalism. For example, by looking at corporate consolidation of media, students learn that this could mean fewer independent voices, which could result in biased coverage. This way, Ma said, students will obtain a bigger picture of how things like socialization, global and local flows of ideas and cultures, power and identity politics can affect how they approach and report on a certain community. Through this awareness, students can then become more conscious journalists and will not fall into the pitfalls of stereotyping and misrepresentation. Moreover, she said, students will learn that axes of identity, such as race, gender, class and sexual orientation do not occur in a vacuum. In fact, they intersect with each other, and such 36  intersections can be apparent in any beat, including sports and fashion. In her class, Ma integrated sports reporting into a discussion about racism by offering the example of Ben Johnson, and how he was identified by mainstream media as a “Canadian Olympic gold medalist,” and then as a “Jamaican from Scarborough” when he was stripped of his gold medal. 5.2   From Being Ghettoized to Being Holistic  Ma added that covering racial diversity is important, but she saw Miller‟s original curriculum as simply a course that taught students to survey the city‟s ethnicities, to report on communities with which they are not familiar, and to be sensitive to various religions and communities. She argued that if the course was structured this way, students will develop essentialized views of communities rather than an understanding of the social and historical context that shape such communities, and how the power and privilege of certain people can influence media coverage of others who are traditionally marginalized. Teaching somebody about Gerrard Street and Little India does not teach them about racism, or, you know, systemic discrimination issues. It simply teaches them there‟s a South Asian community in Toronto and what their issues might be. It has some value but it‟s not—to me it‟s not critical thinking and it‟s not anti-racist thinking, doesn‟t look at it from a sociological perspective at all (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  Here, Miller defended his original conceptualization of the course, claiming that the aim was always to get students to be critical of some of the bad habits, such as stereotyping, that journalists resort to when reporting on race and religion. He also emphasized the importance of the civic mapping assignment in getting students to recognize that many communities, white or otherwise, are not monolithic. For this assignment, students were required to go into a community they knew nothing about, and where they were a visible minority and seen as an outsider. The goal was for students to find out “who‟s who” and “what‟s what,” in that community, and to find under-reported stories about these communities. Through this 37  assignment, students were also able to find out whether factions existed within the community they‟re mapping, and how these differences were defined.  And they could be the difference between Canadian-born Chinese and Hong Kong-born Chinese. There [are] cultural divides that are quite— they play out in what people wear, you know, where they hang out (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).  Nonetheless, Ma‟s criticism is worth noting because, as Mahtani (2008) has concluded, reporting on “fluffy” pieces such as the celebration of ethnic events and festivals is not any less problematic than coverage that associates certain racialized groups with crime and violence. Mahtani argued that such “light coverage” only promotes “staged ethnic representations,” where the highlighting of different food, family and personal and religious practices are seen as a snapshot of cultures when in fact, each individual culture is fluid and varied (p.652). 5.3   From a Separate Diversity Course to Incorporating Diversity into the Curriculum As stated earlier, another significant change to the course since its introduction is that the diversity component now includes gender diversity and covering people with physical and mental disabilities in addition to racial diversity. In addition, several weeks of the term rather than the entire term is devoted to teaching the diversity component. Again, for Luk, this was simply the curriculum she had inherited, and for Ma, it was a conscious decision to change the course content. However, Ma said she also did it out of obligation to her faculty chair (“It‟s very difficult to say no to your chair who asked you personally to teach a course”), who had decided to revise the journalism curriculum. The faculty chair, she said, had felt that Miller‟s original course was a “ghettoized idea of covering diversity,” and instead, they wanted something that was more post-modern, more rooted in critical thinking and theory, and that was woven throughout the entire program and curriculum. 38     5.3.1  Importance of Driving Diversity into Journalism’s DNA  In Ma‟s opinion, embedding a diversity component in not only “Critical Issues”, but in every journalism course in the program is much better than just having a course singled out as, “This is the class we talk about race in the media or diversity.” She argued that race permeates all kinds of issues covered by the media, and all instructors should be encouraged to integrate this component into their teaching. Both Miller and Luk agreed. In fact, Miller said ”Critical Issues” was created as a separate course originally only because the issue of race was not being approached in other reporting classes. The long term plan was to you know, get it to the point where the students in that course were really breaking good stories that were getting published and show to the rest of the school this should be an element of all reporting classes. Eventually it was going to be part of other courses, but it never got to that point. There was hostility or indifference on the part of the rest of the faculty and looking back, I probably could have done a better job to sell it to the rest of the faculty (Miller, personal communication, February 21, 2011).  Luk added that because most journalism schools in Canada draw their instructors from a pool of journalists who are mostly white, middle-aged men, many are not partial to the idea, or even competent or knowledgeable enough to incorporate a discussion of racial diversity into their teaching. The reality is that unless you‟re consciously—as an instructor, unless you‟re consciously considering the diversity aspect of an issue, it‟s going to be gone, it‟s going to be lost. And I think that‟s the problem with newsrooms, is that they don‟t consciously think about this. That‟s why we get all the mental illness stories about white people, that‟s why we get business stories mainly about white people (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).  Here, Luk reflected upon the same conclusion that Mahtani (2001) did. Journalists are largely bound by the dominant cultures within which they operate. Therefore, their story ideas, and their choices of framing, sources, quotes and images are influenced by their own socialization, personal experiences and understanding of the world around them (Mahtani, 2001). 39  As Luk pointed out, when news staff are predominantly white, then their experience with or knowledge of cultural experiences different from their own can be limited. Given this reality, Luk concluded that even though it would be most ideal to have the diversity component permeate entire courses in a journalism school, she does not believe the majority of journalism teachers in Canada have reached that point yet. As a result, she believes a separate course focused solely on diversity in race, gender and sex, and ability is necessary.  40  6  Setting an Example for Others: How this Case Study Can be of Use to the UBC Graduate School of Journalism The UBC Graduate School of Journalism recognizes that teaching meaningful diversity is a crucial determinant of excellence in education for students who will become practicing journalists in the future. As a result, the school has been actively recruiting more graduate students from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds and with diverse interests and specializations. It has also recently appointed a faculty member who is a member of the Tahltan Nation as assistant professor. The School has also previously hosted a guest speaker from CBC to speak about diversity initiatives in the CBC newsrooms, as well as members of the Asian- Canadian Journalist Association (ACJA). Furthermore, similar to Ma‟s course syllabus, a diversity aspect has purposely been included in the school‟s core journalism class, “Integrated Journalism” and in the course, “Media Ethics and Leadership,” where two of the 13 topics specifically look at “Gender, Class, Justice” and “Race, Ethnicity and Indigeneity.” 6.1   Making Diversity an Even Higher Priority   This study suggests that there are ways in which teaching diversity coverage can be strengthened at the UBC J-School. Certainly, inclusivity is important in everything taught on a university campus. Therefore, it may appear to be more ideal to have courses that include a diversity element rather than a specific course on diversity, for if students are continually exposed to and educated about the importance of understanding race and culture, that insight may become a natural part of the journalism they produce. However, given that the problematization of racialized minorities is still so prominent in Canadian mainstream media today, it appears that learning to cover diversity well may require both a separate course on 41  diversity to develop in-depth understanding, and infusing diversity issues in the rest of the curriculum in a meaningful manner. Given that the UBC J-School is a graduate school, both instructors and students are expected to exhibit professional, respectful behaviour and demonstrate an aptitude for journalism. As a result, a separate course on covering diversity issues at the graduate level may be less likely to generate the kind of negative or defensive responses that were experienced at the undergraduate level, as was the case with Ryerson University. Moreover, if it was an elective rather than a compulsory course, instructors may be able to filter out those students who resent being in a class in which they have no interest. Nonetheless, instructors must be aware that topics such as race and gender are often difficult for anyone (including the instructor him/herself) to talk about. Therefore, whether the School establishes a separate course on diversity coverage or incorporates a diversity component into all courses, instructors must establish a safe environment for people to honestly express their feelings, or ask uncomfortable or awkward questions without fear of being reprimanded by their colleagues.  However, as Miller demonstrated, a separate course on diversity coverage affects not only students, but faculty members as well. Just as there is institutional bias in news organizations, the same exists among journalism schools. Thus, it is equally important for faculty to stand united behind this course, or at the very least, remain open-minded to the idea so that faculty politics will not affect the course‟s impact on students. Therefore, all staff members must be fully committed to including this course into the journalism program and infusing a diversity aspect into their own individual courses. Moreover, the program must fully understand that the nature of the course content, as the Ryerson instructors have demonstrated, could generate low course evaluations from students. Thus, for a separate course to have impact, it may be necessary 42  to ensure that while instructors should accept constructive criticism from students and make improvements to their teaching, the evaluations would not count against their promotion or tenure.    6.1.1   Future Considerations   If the UBC J-School were to include such a course solely on covering diversity, then the faculty must think about the following: what kind of readings should be assigned? What kind of teaching strategies would they use? What does “diversity” really mean? Who can teach this course, and what must the instructor be prepared for in order to teach it effectively?  And if the UBC J-School were to include a diversity component into all journalism courses instead, as they are doing currently, and want to further improve that aspect, then the faculty must think about the following: how can all instructors incorporate that component into their readings, assignments and class discussions? How must the instructor prepare in advance in order to teach this part of the course effectively?  And finally, regardless of which option the school chooses, faculty also need to think about the more practical and structural aspects of the course: when should this course be offered—during first or second year, first or second term? Should it be a mandatory course or an elective? Should it for only one term, or for two?  To offer some recommendations, the following sections will draw upon the experiences and advice of the three “Critical Issues” professors. 6.2   Teaching the Course: Calling all Thick-Skinned but Intelligent and Insightful Teachers In previous sections, it became apparent that in order to teach students how to cover sensitive issues such as race, religion and gender, the instructor must acknowledge students’ 43  feelings and realize that talking about individual biases can rile up feelings of resentment, guilt and even hurt. In addition, instructors must be aware of how their own emotions can come into play, especially when students directly challenge them. As Earnest L. Perry Jr., associate professor and chair of journalism studies at the Missouri School of Journalism wrote, “When done right, [teaching cross-cultural reporting] is hard not only for the students, but also for the instructor” because an effective instructor uses every opportunity to challenge students’ belief that they are “culturally sensitive”(Perry, 2006, p.3). As a result, students could feel offended and react by directly attacking the instructor’s teaching or character, as was the case with Miller, who noted that his ratemyprofessor.com student ratings included hurtful comments that called him judgmental, smug and hypocritical. However, he claimed he has “a pretty thick skin”—something that kept him from taking such negative comments personally and pushed him to remain open to students’ criticism. He gave the example of when a student asked about why gender and sexual diversity was not being given as much attention in the class. And one of the instructors said, ―Well, because this is what‘s important now. People are coming to terms with homosexuality and gay people and it‘s not as—we‘ve sort of solved that.‖ And this person just went berzerk, and said, ―We haven‘t solved it.‖ And so you had to be careful in the arguments, and it became easier to say you know, ―That‘s a very good point and we hope the course will develop that way, and what would that consist of (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011)?  Developing a “thick skin” against negative comments and rejection may be important, but so too is encouraging students to talk honestly about their feelings in order to alleviate tension is crucial. In addition to having extensive knowledge of the subject, bringing in teaching assistants and journalists from diverse backgrounds to share “authentic” personal experiences and stories about how they are treated in the newsroom could expose students to new experiences. However, being an instructor of colour and teaching about journalism and diversity has a different type of emotional baggage. As stated earlier, Ma was very aware of the rarity of her 44  racial status in the academy, and she had feared teaching a course on diversity because she anticipated students would react negatively. She had also indicated a slight fatigue, when she described the way she had to negotiate the power dynamics within the classroom and faculty. The frustration arising from a racial and gender double standard—white male professors tend to automatically command students‟ respect while female professors of colour (especially younger ones) tend to have to work harder to earn it because students view them to be lacking experience and legitimacy (Harlow, 2003)—was not something her fellow professors in the journalism program or otherwise seemed to understand. Given Ma‟s experience as an example, professors of colour teaching a course about race and the media may find that they have to manage both personal and professional emotions far more extensively than their white counterparts, and that they have to struggle harder to win a sense of control over their ability in the classroom (Harlow, 2003). Yet, like Miller said, having a diverse faculty is important. If journalism teachers are all white, then their experiences will probably be limited and this lack of insight can affect how well they teach this course. However, as Luk pointed out, having white instructors as the majority is inevitable because most schools are drawing teachers from a pool of journalists who are mostly white.  “Can a white person, can a white man teach this?” she mused. “Probably an intelligent white male can teach this, but you [have] got to be intelligent.”  An “intelligent,” teacher, then, must be observant and able to empathize and be sensitive to students‟ feelings. More importantly, they must be competent enough to teach both similarities and differences within a multicultural society. Otherwise, they will fall into the usual stereotypes.   45  6.3   Readings Selection  In selecting readings and case studies for the course, all three instructors said material that would provoke discussions and pose questions is most ideal.  Miller suggested that readings should cover a range of issues, such as racial stereotyping, limited sourcing, and the use of words and images that may misrepresent a particular minority group, while Ma said in more generalized terms that readings must bring students into a conversation about a particular topic in the course, and must help students articulate an opinion about a specific issue around journalism.  Luk insisted that readings must be current, journalistic articles as opposed to academic articles. For one, her students indicated they hated reading some of the academic journals that were assigned. For another, she believes “journalism is to write journalism.” Students should not be “fussing around with these academic things” when they need to “go out there and try to cover something involving blacks and find out how difficult it is,” she said. Because these issues are very problematic in the newsroom today, it‟s very much a live problem and so if you‟re training journalists for the future, it would be really great if they would tackle these things. And that‟s why it should never be covered academically for a journalism school. Sociologists can do that. We‟re journalism, we need to do the hands- on, nitty gritty—get your hands dirty and see how you‟re going to fail when you have to cover a racial issue (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  By reading or watching news clippings that contained problematic stereotypes, Luk said students can see when stories were not “done right,” and when an issue was complicated to cover. Consequently, they can brainstorm alternatives and discuss the possibility that there may not be a correct answer to how to cover particular issues. If a diversity element was incorporated into the entire journalism program, Ma suggests that instructors all examine their reading lists and see where they can incorporate more diverse points of views and where they can add stories produced by journalists who are not traditionally included. 46  6.4   Assignments  Assignments in “Critical Issues” aimed to sharpen students’ journalistic skills as well as to get students to check their own biases in terms of story framing and source selection. For example, Miller‟s civic mapping assignment aimed to help students unlearn stereotypes and discover stories. Students would explore a chosen racial or religious minority community with which they are not familiar. Then they would present their findings to the class, such as the type of institutions and religions that are prevalent in that community, the authority figures, the prominent newspapers and television networks, and some of the issues with which the community is contending. Students were then required to submit a story that examines an issue that they discovered from the civic mapping assignment. Miller said this assignment is helpful because it encouraged students to pretend they are not a journalist. Instead, he told them to look at the community through the lens of an urban geographer wanting to find out more about a community. This strategy can help move students away from a, “I better have a story in mind” mindset before they even approach a community. Luk, on the other hand, said civic mapping was not helpful. She and her co-teacher also assigned it, but it differed slightly from Miller‟s because students were required only to “pick a neighbourhood or a group and tell [the class] all about it,” and did not need to produce any stories afterwards. Evidently, the discrepancy between the two civic mapping assignments, in terms of the assignment itself and the outcomes, illustrate a problem with passing on the course. There was little coordination and communication between instructors and, as Luk demonstrated when she inherited the course, a tendency to reinvent the course each time it was passed on to someone new. 47  Miller concluded as much, especially when his successors did not accept his offer of course materials. They just said no, we‘ve got our ideas for this class, and blah blah blah. Well to me that was short-sighted… when the resources are there and the people are willing to help you and provide all the material you want, you know, why say no? That‘s just dumb (Miller, personal communication, February 21, 2011).  Luk agreed, saying a lot of effort is wasted on figuring out what this course means when a new instructor reinvents the wheel each time. Nonetheless, she said that if she were to teach the course again, she would abolish the civic mapping assignment. Instead, she would get students to write three to four stories about a particular minority group, and throughout the term she would meet with students to discuss story angles and problems they are having. The first story could be a profile, so that students could establish contacts and story ideas, but by the third or fourth story, the story should touch on an issue that involves tension. I want something that‟s uncomfortable. Something that‟s uncomfortable to discuss, where it may not be any—where no one side is actually right, where the community is divided over it and quite vehement about it…I want them to do conflict stories because those are very difficult to do…I think for the students it‟s more important for them to understand how touchy things are (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Ma, who believed civic mapping does not help students to think critically about their craft, assigned a talk show production plan instead. The talk show topic had to be related to any one of the 12 topics that were covered in class. Students were required to speak to sources in a particular group, such as queer youth, and to ask questions of sources about a specific issue with which queer youth may be dealing, such as high suicide rates. So it might mean calling up an editor, it might mean calling up a particular activist to discuss what the critical issue in journalism was at that time, which was, how is this topic covered and did this particular campaign have any impact (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  Ma said this exercise allowed students to get the type of hands-on reporting experience that they may not get in other classes. Here, they can obtain a different sensitivity to approaching 48  communities with which they are not familiar, and understand they can‟t be “calling things by the wrong name because people will turn off.” As well, through this assignment, students can learn the importance of using different angles and sources that may be missing from the mainstream press. I want them to be holistic about it and look at it at, you know, so what is the gay press covering? Who is the gay press leaving out? Is the gay press leaving out, you know, a particular segment of the population? Is the gay press leaving out people of colour (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  Luk agreed that this approach of considering different voices which can be incorporated into any story and any form of storytelling is ideal for if a diversity element is to be incorporated into all journalism courses. That means if you‟re teaching feature writing, or magazine-length journalism, you want the story ideas to always consider that component, to always think about—it should be at the back of your mind. It shouldn‟t be overt in every story, but you should always ask yourself the question, is there some way to be—make this more diverse, to reflect the population that you‟re reporting on, and reflect the people, the audience or the readers who will be looking at that (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011)?     6.4.1   Evaluation  Miller and Luk realized early on that exams were not helpful. As this course can evoke strong emotions in students, Miller said students might let these feelings overcome them and purposely write provocative answers that would lead to a poor grade. Since at the graduate level, small group seminars are the norm rather than large class lectures, exams would seem unnecessary at the UBC J-School as well. After several years of teaching “Critical Issues,” and evaluating students, Miller developed a marking rubric for assignments and stories that may be helpful for UBC J-School professors, called the diversity scale. At the lowest level, Miller said, is “no diversity coverage,” where a student‟s story is full of racial stereotyping, inaccurate information and limited sources. 49  At the next level is the “song and dance coverage,” where a story focuses on celebrating ethnic events and festivals. Then there is “unconscious diversity coverage,” where a story‟s character just so happens to be from a particular racial or ethnic group, but the story‟s topic is unrelated to that character‟s racial identity. Finally, there is “conscious diversity coverage.” Through this scale, Miller said students could locate where they believe their journalistic work is at, and could then make improvements to achieve a higher level. Not only does Miller‟s diversity scale demonstrate an understanding of how individual bias can affect one‟s reporting, it also offers a method to access and overcome that bias, and to produce more sophisticated and analytical coverage of racialized minorities. Therefore, not only can it be adapted by journalism schools, it can also be of use to media industries as well to assess their own work. Here, Ma gave an industry example of the difference between what Miller calls “song and dance coverage,” and “conscious diversity coverage.” The Globe and Mail are like, “Let‟s cover the different communities. Let‟s do a story on Chinese New Year. We‟ll do a story on Chinese New Year or the Moon Festival and you know, go into Chinatown and see the dragon and see moon cakes and dim sum.” That‟s a nice story, nothing wrong with that, but there‟s nothing interesting about that necessarily either. It doesn‟t—it‟s not analyzing anything, for me, about Chinese people in Canada. The more interesting story for me is, can you do a story that looks at the history of…you know, the fact that white women were arrested for marrying Chinese men in the fifties? Can you look at something that talks about the Chinese head tax and see, you know, where the Chinese community is on that issue today (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011)?  6.5   Teaching Strategies   To get students to understand the complexities behind different racial and minority groups, identify the problems behind stereotypical coverage, and produce stories that are more accurate is a daunting task. All three professors had to utilize various strategies to push students to confront their own biases, to engage them in discussions about the course material, and to produce in-depth and accurate stories. 50     6.5.1   Case Studies  Presenting case studies that did not meet the standards of fair and accurate coverage of racial minorities was a useful method to get class discussions going and to get students to think critically about the article. Miller and Luk found it helpful to first present a story that involves a particular racial minority, but to remove or change the racial identifiers or epithets. After students have discussed the story—often concluding with a, “What‟s wrong with this?”—the professors would then insert the racial identifiers again. This exercise was meant to help students see that when racial minorities are incorporated into an otherwise acceptable story, the article can become discriminatory.  For example, Miller assigned a reading taken from Stormfront.org, a white supremacist website. The article, called “What is Racism?” argued that double standards are at work for white-Americans when it comes to racism: When a white man kills a black man and uses the word \"nigger\" while doing so, there is an enormous media uproar and the nation beats its collective breast; when members of the black Yahweh cult carry out ritual murders of random whites, the media are silent (see AR of March, 1991). College campuses forbid pejorative statements about non-whites as \"racist,\" but ignore scurrilous attacks on whites (Jackson). Miller took the “identifying stuff” off, and had students discuss the article.  And when I thought the moment was right, I said, “Well, why did I find this at a white supremacist site?” And the whole class just—their mouths dropped opened, and so then we had to look at it again and said,  “Well…oh. I see. Yeah” (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).   Similarly, Luk said if she were to teach this course again, she would use the Maclean’s story, “Too Asian?” as teaching tool, where she would first present the original story, and then substitute all references to Asian-Canadians with Jewish people. Because I know there will be people in the class who would go, „What‟s the problem? You‟re being called smart.” But it‟s always bad to be singled out as, you know, the Jews under Nazi Germany found out, if you had to wear a yellow star, it‟s not a good thing. 51  With Asians of course, they‟re visibly different, we‟re talking about visible minorities (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).  Here it may be necessary to clarify once again that the term “visible minority” used to describe Asians in Canada is relative to where they are situated in Canada. For example, to call many Asian-Canadians “visible minorities” in cities such as Vancouver and Toronto is misleading because percentage-wise, the population of Asian-Canadians is rapidly rising in relation to what would be considered the white majority in other parts of the nation. The term also implies inferiority. As a result, it may be necessary for instructors to encourage students to think critically about common sense but problematic language such as “visible minority”, “person of colour”, “racial minority”, and “person with disability.” Also, students should also be encouraged to think about when and when not to use racial identifiers in a story. When applied to certain people out of context or relevancy, these identifiers further marginalize them as being different from or inferior to the mainstream. Certainly, instructors and students are not to be expected to come up with concrete alternatives. Nonetheless, discussing this issue could push students to think more carefully about how they can use language that is more representative when they produce stories.    6.5.2   Guest Speakers  Miller and Luk also found that bringing in working journalists who can speak passionately and articulate clearly about their work was another method to engage students in discussion and to ask questions. Guest speakers often have first-hand experiences that the instructors do not For example, Luk said students seemed most engaged when, during the week that she was teaching about covering people with disabilities, she brought in a CBC producer who uses a wheelchair. Since the producer had quite a personality—“She came in and she was spitting mad 52  because she couldn‟t even get into the building without going all around because there‟s no wheelchair access,” said Luk—she was able to captivate the students, especially one who also used a wheelchair. The producer showed story clips about a Canadian soldier in Afghanistan who had lost one of his legs in a blast. She then talked about how he was immediately labeled by the media as a hero, but in her opinion, a better story would be to ask deeper questions about any kind of trauma this soldier might be suffering from, or why he decided to stay in Afghanistan still. Anyway, she launched this discussion and I think because I had a real-life example, a person coming in who was a journalist and because she brought a clip that showed how one-dimensional this was—and in fact, in the final exam most of the kids wrote about this. You know, I gave them a choice of topics, so I think that one they understood, they got it, so it was really good (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).     6.5.3   Scoping for Stories: Getting Past Resistance and Gaining Trust  Journalists often experience challenges getting a story when they approach people who are suspicious of the media. This suspicion may be even more pronounced amongst racial or religious minorities who are wary of media that misrepresents them, as El-Gawley demonstrated with her experience interviewing Lebanese-Australians who are hostile to Australian media for frequently depicting them as criminals (2009). For Luk, meeting resistance from sources is a lesson in and of itself. The best lesson for them would be if people didn‟t welcome them with open arms and they had to find out how to gain trust, how to persuade people to talk to them. That would be ideal, actually. I don‟t—I want them to find how difficult it is to get people to talk (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).  To get past this difficulty, Miller and Luk offered their students pointers on how to gain trust from racial minority communities.  Miller said spending time with people in the community can help alleviate tension. He said that in the late 90s, one of the toughest communities to penetrate in Toronto was the Korean 53  community. When he asked some of his students, “Well, where‟s it located? What‟s there?”, the group answered, “Well, there are a lot of karaoke bars.” Therefore, Miller said, “Well that‟s a good place to go hang out. Go have a beer and talk to people.” As a result, students came back with a story: it turns out singing karaoke is a popular way for many young Korean-Canadians who have pulled away from their heritage and cannot speak Korean to get back in touch with their native language.  Spending time in a community in a “non-controversial way” is what Luk calls the “soft approach.” However, the “hard approach” is also necessary, particularly when approaching people in authority.  So door-stopping them, like, waiting and ambushing them when they come out of their office or something, or waiting outside their house,” she explained. “So there‟s many different ways to find out—of course if somebody won‟t talk to you, you might have to go around them and talk to somebody who works with them. Or another approach should be to talk to the other side and say, “Look, I‟ve got the other side, if you want to give me your side, this is your last chance” (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011).     6.5.4   Establishing Contacts  Once students have gotten past the initial resistance from the community they are reporting on, they must then establish contacts so they can get information for their story assignments. Luk said one of the easiest ways to do so is to assign students a profile story. Students will have to identify a person from the community they are reporting on—whether it is a particular ethnic group, or an association for people with mental disabilities, or an activist group—and write a profile story. During that interview, students should find out what other participants from the community they should speak to, and from there, tease out some story ideas.  Because anybody—everybody has a story, but they‟ve got to be sort of participating in some perceived group. You can‟t pick an Iranian-Canadian who has nothing to do with Iranian-Canadians…I think after you‟ve done the profile, you would have met maybe 54  three or four or five people. One of them is going to be able to direct you to something that‟s going on (Luk, personal communication, January 27, 2011).   Here, Luk made an important point about self-racialization and essentialization. It is not enough to identify a perceived racial group and then assume that such a group is homogenous and all members share the same characteristics, values and interests. When reporting on a particular community, journalists must take into consideration context and how people identify themselves. As Luk pointed out, an Iranian-Canadian could be labeled as such due to his race, appearance or citizenship—he may “look” like an Iranian, or be an Iranian by birth who has Canadian citizenship, or a person whose parents are an Iranian and a Canadian, and so on—but may not identify himself as such. In fact, all three instructors agreed that journalists must be careful not to make generalized constructions of their sources‟ identities just to fit them into a story. You can‟t really say anything when you say, “Well, the black community thinks that…Well, the black community is very diverse. Lots of communities are very diverse, and I said, “Well, it‟s like the white community. Who speaks for the white community? You know, it‟s very diverse.” So let‟s go out of the notion that we‟re going to do this group today or this week, and another group next week. News doesn‟t work like that (Miller, personal communication, January 21, 2011).   Likewise, Luk said that one of the valued skills of reporting is understanding the complexity of an issue, and translating it into simple terms for the reader without oversimplifying or distorting the truth. Therefore, part of the instructor‟s lecture must include lessons about stereotyping and about assuming a monolithic community. In addition, both she and Ma said that lessons must be given on intersectionality of identities, and how slotting sources in a particular identity can become problematic. Here, Luk gave the example of reporting on people with mental illnesses, and argued that stories on mental illnesses in the mainstream press tends to focus only on either homeless people, or on middle-class, white people whose first 55  language is English and who have been in Canada for several generations. And it‟s just a presumption that it doesn‟t cross ethnic groups, it doesn‟t cross class. We don‟t have mental illness [stories] about Muslims, for instance, and there are. We don‟t have mental illness stories about Chinese, or gay people, because that‟s really touchy right (Luk, personal communication, February 1, 2011)?  Therefore, Luk suggested that a good teaching strategy is to have students pick a perceived group in the community—whether it‟s an ethnic group, or a group of transgendered people or people who are HIV-positive—and from there, scout out a possible story about someone who is suffering from a mental illness.  Ma also stressed to her students the importance of maintaining an updated source list. She encouraged students to write down the name and phone numbers of everyone they speak to in order to get a variety of sources. That way, they are not constantly relying on the same “expert” for their stories. Going to that same expert for a quote is one of the pitfalls that journalists often fall into, and is a reason why stories can turn out one-sided.  You‟re on a deadline so [you‟re] going to call that same older professor at the School of…you know, Health, because he can always answer the questions about whatever your story is about…Aboriginals in Winnipeg, or you know, high suicide rates (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  But by talking to different experts who are knowledgeable about the same issue, students can bring fresh perspectives to an old, tired story. The other thing is, well, let‟s look at the story from a different angle instead of constantly looking at the question of why, hmm…let‟s see, there‟s a high suicide rate amongst Aboriginal youth in Winnipeg. Maybe the question could be, instead, today or this week is, what are youth doing in a positive way? So it‟s about also flipping that very paradigm (Ma, personal communication, January 24, 2011).  56  7  Conclusion  Through my research, I discovered that teaching journalism students to report on issues involving racial diversity in a fair and accurate way is not simply about setting up a course and teaching students about best practices. Instead, as Ryerson instructors John Miller, Joy Luk and Kali Ma have proven, instructors have to deal with a multitude of issues that have less to do with the mechanics of giving lectures, assigning readings and marking assignments, and more to do with managing complex emotions that arise from student opposition and faculty politics. First, the instructor must always be conscious that getting students to discuss touchy subjects such as race and/or gender forces students to confront their own unconscious biases. This in turn can cause them to resent the course and its instructors. Therefore, the instructor must be a good course facilitator in the sense that he or she can establish a safe haven for students to speak honestly about their opinions and to alleviate tension when it builds up. On the other hand, allowing students to speak openly can induce them to direct hostile and wounding comments at the professor. Thus, teaching this course can mean instructors have to deal with a fair bit of hurt and frustration, particularly when the topic is something they are very passionate about or can relate to. Thus, they must be prepared to manage those emotions. Finally, advocates for a separate course on diversity coverage or for the inclusion of a diversity element into the entire journalism curriculum must be prepared for a possible lack of appreciation on faculty‟s part for diversity‟s relevance to journalism education. This could mean that advocates may have to consider how fighting for such a course can affect their employment or relationship with other faculty members. As a result, whether the UBC Graduate School of Journalism chooses to establish a separate course focused on covering diversity or to further incorporate a diversity element into all their reporting classes, the faculty must take these factors into consideration. 57  Bibliography El-Gawley, N., & O\\'Donnell, P.

COURSE OUTLINE JANUARY 2006  Some of the biggest issues in the news today – from the war on terror, to the debate over immigration, to the coverage of crime and policing, to the conflict in the Middle East – draw journalists into questions about race, religion and ethnicity. To get the story, you may have to unlearn stereotypes, get people to trust you who are suspicious of the media or even hostile, and ask awkward questions about religious, cultural and historical traditions. Toronto is one of the world‘s most cosmopolitan cities. Fifty-two percent of its residents are foreign born, and most of them are non-white. So no matter who you are, one out of every two interviews you do may be with someone of a different colour, culture or religion. The people who read, watch or listen to your work will reflect the same diversity. This puts a special responsibility on journalists. Why? Because coverage that springs from ignorance, or is inhibited by fear of the unfamiliar, falls short of the core values of fairness, clarity, context and accuracy. In this course, you will learn the tools to do it right.  Format: Undergraduate students in all streams of third year will meet each week for a two- hour general presentation, lecture or group discussion. This large group will be divided into four smaller one-hour seminar groups, each with its own instructor, to discuss the presentation or do practical exercises stemming from it.  Goals: We will:  Identify nine ideas for strengthening journalism.  Use them as tools to address some blind spots journalism has on matters of race and  religion.  Understand why and how some groups are often ignored or stereotyped by the 62   mainstream media.  Develop a strategy to fairly and accurately cover these groups and individuals.  Find fresh story ideas –– about achievement as well as conflict –– within these  communities.  Learn how to frame stories properly to add depth and context.  Pitch diversity stories to the professional media. Text: Students must buy the yellow workbook that contains readings for class and seminars. It‘s sold in the bookstore –“Critical Issues in Journalism: Workbook, readings and tips for JRN 301.”  What is diversity? Diversity means difference, and this can include differences of language, cultural background, race, gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, religion and physical ability. In this course, we will focus on cross-cultural reporting, and the skills required to tell interesting and accurate stories through the lens of race and religion. You will be expected to cover stories in communities where you are a visible minority.  Ethics: Cross-cultural reporting is really about practicing good journalism. Since a journalist is only as valuable as his or her integrity, we expect that each piece of work you submit is purely your own; that all sources of information and quotations are scrupulously attributed; and that your reporting is actual and current. Penalties for fabrication or plagiarism range from failure in the assignment to failure in the course.  Ground rules: In this course, we talk about issues that are sometimes difficult to talk about. This is a safe place. We expect you to show respect to your fellow students, to instructors and to guest speakers. But we encourage you to express your thoughts openly. The course will accomplish little if it does not cause you to think more deeply about some of these issues, and challenge some of your assumptions about the world and other people.  Responsibility: You are expected to show up on time for every class. Do not schedule interviews or work for this or other classes during the period you should be here. You must also have a Ryerson e-mail account so instructors can communicate with everyone.  Deadlines: Your work is due on time –– at the beginning of your seminar period, on the week noted. One copy of each assignment must be handed to your instructor in person, or sent by e-mail at the start of class. Late assignments will carry penalties of 20 per cent per day. Missed assignments will be considered grounds for failure. A request for an extended deadline will only be given on medical or compassionate grounds, and only if the instructor is informed before the original due date.  Assignments: (See detailed assignment instructions below) 30% Civic ―mapping‖ assignment (team project) –– You will create a road map for how a particular racial or religious minority community in Toronto works, how journalists can tap into the different layers, and what stories are building beneath the surface.

The final feature will also be evaluated according to the Journalism Diversity Scale in the course workbook (A is “―mainstreaming,”‖ B is “―diversity by design,”‖ C is “―diversity by accident,”‖ D is “―token coverage”‖). Gross errors of fact, including misspelling a proper name, will be grounds for failure on any assignment. 65   TEAM PROJECT –– Civic mapping (30%) Due on Feb. 7. Form yourselves into groups of four to select a community that no one in your group has ties to. You may choose a racial or religious minority that does not appear on the list handed out on Jan. 17, but it must be approved by your instructor. Follow the outline and instructions for Civic Mapping in your workbook. Your report should be written in point form under the following headings: (a) Overview of community (b) How things get dealt with (c) The go-to places (d) The go-to sources (e) History (f) Current issues (g) Sensitivities  Major feature project (40%) Outline due on Feb. 14, story on March 21. You will pitch your major feature story idea at a meeting with your instructor on Feb. 14. You need a written outline for that meeting based on your research, preliminary interviews/visits/observations. The outline should be divided into the following sections: (a) The community (b) What‘s the story and why is it new; (c) Why the story is interesting/relevant/important; (d) How you know the story is there (discuss your preliminary research, who you spoke to, what you experienced (e) Who you plan to interview and why The focus of the feature should be on the conflicts/achievements/experiences that minorities are facing in Toronto in the year 2004. Particular attention should be paid to how these groups and individuals are being treated by the major institutions of our society. You may also choose to focus on the pressures within those communities (social, generational, economic, political, cultural, etc.) Each 1,000-word story should contain several sources, be written in a featurish style (show- don‘t-tell, strong theme paragraph, etc.) and explore new ground. NOTE: When you identify yourself to sources, say you‘re a Ryerson journalism student working on a classroom project that you hope will be published. All sources for your story should be identified fully with their phone number. Broadcast students have the option of submitting a script for a 5-minute video or audio documentary. EXAMPLES OF ISSUES: Immigration, discrimination, gender, neighbourhoods, business, social services, generational conflict, conflict with another group, urban demographics, religion, education, policing and crime, media portrayal, real estate, political involvement, disability, transportation, public health, sexuality, recognition and achievement, lifestyle/culture, recognition of foreign professional credentials, etc.  Content analysis (20%) Due on April 11. You will monitor five consecutive issues of a newspaper, television newscast or copies of a magazine to assess how they are depicting visible minorities. Content analyses will be explained in class. You should include both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the content. Your 800-word report should include comment on your findings from a member of that news 66  organization. You should pay particular attention to the following areas, and give examples where appropriate: (a) How often visible minorities appear as reporters, commentators and sources; (b) What minority issues are discussed, and how; (c) Your conclusions about how effective this media outlet is in dealing with visible minorities.  Marking criteria Your assignments will be marked by your seminar instructor, who subscribes to the following general guidelines. For each assignment, you will be given a numerical mark (out of 10, 15 or 40, depending on the weight of the assignment). These will be added up and translated into letter grades, using the following standards: A Outstanding work, showing a thorough understanding of the concepts introduced in class and exhibiting critical and original thought. A publishable piece of work. You have tried to break new ground. Your research allows you to give logical and convincing support for your conclusions. You have found excellent sources and used concrete examples. You write with style and clarity. B Very good work, showing a good understanding of the concepts involved. Conclusions are clearly stated, although conventional. There is good support for your conclusions, although you have not addressed some minor areas of the question or assignment. If it‘s a reporting assignment, it may need more sources or questions answered but are basically a sound story. C Satisfactory work, showing a good attempt to understand the concepts involved. Conclusions may be clearly stated but show gaps in logic or research. Writing is fuzzy, to the point that it blunts some of your findings. Several aspects of the questions have not been addressed. Sources are mainly the usual suspects; you haven‘t dug for new ones. Work cannot be published until more research is done. D Passable work, but with a poor attempt to understand and address the key concepts. Not all conclusions are supported by logic or research and sometimes you fail to include key elements of the question. Writing is sloppy. Key sources have not been interviewed. F Unacceptable work because you fail to deal with the key concepts and are unclear about your conclusions. You have done little or no research and only skim the surface of the issue. Your points are poorly argued. The sources are not appropriate, or not particularly well 67  interviewed. Failure marks can range from zero to 49 per cent. In the case of very late or missing assignments, the mark will be zero.  68  Appendix B: Critical Issues Syllabus Winter 2010 Ryerson University School of Journalism Faculty of Communication and Design JRN 400: Critical Issues in Journalism Winter 2010 Lecture: 1-2 p.m. Thursdays Room: KHE121 Seminars: 2-4 p.m. Section: 012 Room: KHE 220  Section: 021 Room: KHE 222   Introduction This is a time of unparalleled opportunity and challenge in journalism. Dramatic social, technological, political and economic changes are transforming the world and the way we report on it.  Toronto is one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities. Fifty-two percent of its residents are foreign-born, and most of these are nonwhite. So no matter who we are, half of the interviews we do as journalists in Toronto are likely to be with someone of a different colour, culture or religion. Local viewers, listeners and readers reflect this same diversity. Regional and national audiences are also diverse, albeit in different ways.  Therefore, the practice of journalism today requires an understanding of the diversity on display in our societies, an awareness of the pitfalls inherent in reporting on unfamiliar communities, and a concern for those that are invisible or whose stories aren’t being told. We need to be aware of diversity issues in our own ranks, and of what may be lost when newsrooms and their leaders do not reflect a broad range of 69  experience. We also need to recognize blindspots in specific genres or beats such as war, the arts, or health.   Today’s journalists are required to assume new and difficult challenges. The unstoppable reach of the Internet – from online news aggregates to the rise of citizen journalism – has redrawn the traditional lines between professional and amateur journalism and affected major revenues sources for the former. We must be aware of how our own coverage, because of unfamiliarity, ignorance, fear, or over-reliance on questionable sources, may fall short of our core journalistic values of fairness, clarity, context and accuracy. JRN 400 aims to sharpen your critical faculties through topics explored in three units:  1- Covering Diversity: gender, race, religion, mental illness and physical disabilities. 2- Beats/Genres: War, Crime, Health/Science, sports 3- Other Issues: Citizen journalism, the effects of media concentration, convergence and corporate influence. 70   Format  All students meet on Thursdays from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in KHE 121 for a lecture, which may include guest speakers and video presentations. Immediately following, two separate seminar groups will meet for two hours, 2 to 4 p.m., in rooms nearby to discuss the assigned readings and continue the discussion.  Communication  There’s no assigned textbook. All readings (journal articles, as well as newspaper and magazine features) will be posted on Blackboard on a weekly basis in PDF or Word documents, or as web links.  The site will serve as a notice board, so please check regularly for updates.  Please note that some articles that cannot be read online may be distributed in hard copy during class time.  Urgent notifications may reach you via your Ryerson e-mail account, so make sure you monitor it daily. Cell phones should be turned off, or placed on silent or vibrate during classes.  Laptops are to be used for JRN 400 purposes only.   Responsibilities  You are expected to show up on time for all classes.

Seminar will deal more specifically with how to begin the civic mapping assignment. Week 2, Jan 14 - Diversity: Covering Gender A look at representation of women in the news media and how women\\'s roles and experiences in newsrooms inform their coverage. Has the glass ceiling finally been shattered or is diversity in newsrooms just an illusion? Week 3, Jan. 21 – Diversity: Covering Religion In the last decade, Islam, more than any other religion, has increasingly and almost exclusively been identified with terrorism in the Western mainstream news media – often challenging Western notions of tolerance, plurality and accommodation. What is the role and responsibility of the news media regarding the depiction of Islamic culture and Islam as a religion? What is the responsibility of journalists in expanding the range of Muslim voices in areas affecting Muslim populations and stereotypes about Muslims? Have journalists acted as responsible guides or fear mongers? Week 4, Jan 28- Diversity: Covering Race An overview of topics, such as, First Nations, racial profiling, categories such as “visible minority” and “person of colour,” and what they mean to journalism and newsrooms. Week 5, Feb. 4 – Diversity: Covering mental illness and physical disabilities From coverage of homelessness to sports, journalists are often devoid of accurate and sensitive vocabulary and lack understanding to deal with mental and physical ailments.  This class will explore some of the challenges journalists face covering these areas. Week 6, Feb 11 – Beats: Sports (MID-TERM EXAM on readings and class discussions) READING WEEK: Feb 18: No lecture or seminar. 73  Week 7, Feb. 25 - Beats: War –(CIVIC MAPPING ASSIGNMENT DUE War reportage makes for some of the most dangerous but also exciting work for many journalists.  But how accurate is the picture journalists portray from conflict zones when they are filing stories while embedded with troops and when dealing with military censorship?  This class will also explore whether journalists working with the demands of 24/7 news cycles have the tools to cover war fairly. Week 8, March 4 - Beats: Celebrities - One of the big criticisms of Barack Obama during the 2008 election was that he was a celebrity – triggering a YouTube defence from famous-for-being-famous Paris Hilton. How do we avoid being driven to distraction by the boldfaced names? Week 9, March 11 – Beats: Health/Science - Health journalism may arguably be one of the most important forms of public service.  But how well do journalists understand the studies they report on?  How honest are the sources they draw from?  And, how do you report risk without sensationalized scare mongering and without spreading misleading information? Week 10, March 18 – Beats: Fluff - Jan So your editor has assigned you to get a bikini wax or wear a burqa for a day or write about Martha Stewart’s new line of bed sheets. How to commit journalism while writing about fluff? We’ll teach you how to take a stupid story to the next level by never giving up, by always doing your best.  OTHER CRITICAL AREAS: Week 11, March 25 – Concentration of ownership, Convergence and corporate influence on news. What are the implications for news coverage when media chains dominate a region? Just how much of a problem is media concentration and convergence?  Also, we’ll examine how corporate interests influence news stories. Week 12, April 1 – Citizen journalism - Who is a journalist? The impact of Blogs, the Internet, YouTube, twitter, and other video/photo uploading, upcoming technology on the creation and dissemination of news.  Will professional journalists become irrelevant as more and more bloggers and videographers take the 74  news into their own hands? We will examine the merits and shortfalls of citizen journalism. Is comment the same as reporting? Does opinion equal analysis?  Is more journalism better for journalists? Week 13, April 8 – The next wave of critical issues for the news media Critical issues look-ahead with an industry-wide panel discussion. (May change to analyze recent case study) Marking criteria  Here is Ryerson University’s numerical-to-letter-grade conversion table:  Letter grade  Percentage range A+   90-100 A   85-89 A-                  80-84 B+   77-79 B     73-76 B-             70-72 C+    67-69 C    63-66 C-                  60-62 D+   57-59 D                   53-56 D-                  50-52 F    0-49  In-class tests and take-home exams will be graded according to the following criteria:  A (80-100) – Outstanding work, showing a thorough understanding of the concepts introduced in class and exhibiting critical and original thought. You have tried to break new ground. Drawing on solid research, you give logical and convincing support for your conclusions. Your work is written clearly and cogently, is sourced well and provides concrete examples.  B (70-79) – Very good work, showing a good understanding of the concepts involved. Conclusions are clearly stated, albeit conventional. You offer good support for your conclusions, though you may not have addressed some minor areas of the question or assignment. It may need more sources or background information, but it is basically sound.  75  C (60-69) – Satisfactory work, showing a good attempt to understand the concepts involved. Conclusions may be clearly stated but show gaps in logic or research. Writing may be unclear. Several aspects of the question have not been addressed. Sources are predictable and don’t reflect spadework to turn up new ones. The work requires additional research.  D (50-59) – Passable work, but with insufficient success at understanding and addressing key concepts. Not all conclusions are supported by logic or research, and you have failed to include key elements of the question. Writing is sloppy. Key sources may not have been interviewed.  F (0-50) – Unacceptable. The work has failed to understand and address key concepts. Conclusions are unclear. Your work shows little or no research. Points are poorly argued. Sourcing is inadequate or not appropriate. Failure marks can range from zero to 49 per cent.   Miscellaneous  Accommodation: Ryerson and the School of Journalism are committed to providing as much access and accommodation as possible for students with disabilities or other special needs. Please tell us about any such requirements as soon as you can. Please also let us know if accommodations prove unsatisfactory or new requirements arise during the term. If necessary you may refer to Ryerson’s Policy on Academic Consideration and Appeals, available at http://www.ryerson.ca/acadcouncil/policies.html.  Research: As third-year students, you are expected to be familiar with basic computing systems, including word processing, remote communication and networking, e-mail and Internet research practices. You are also expected to be familiar with Ryerson’s Library, particularly the use of its electronic data bases as research tools. Familiarity with Factiva is particularly recommended. This database archives more than 5,000 news and scholarly publications, including most major English-language daily newspapers, newsmagazines, television and radio programs in transcript, magazines and academic journals. It is considered indispensable by many journalists on the job and is invaluable for background on current issues.           76  Appendix C: Critical Issues Syllabus Fall 2010  JRN 400: Critical Issues in Journalism \\u2028Fall 2010 / Wednesday 2- 5pm\\u2028\\u2028 \\u2028------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Introduction The post 9/11 decade marks a time of unparalleled opportunity and challenge in journalism. Dramatic social, technological, political and economic changes are transforming the world and the way we report on it. \\u2028\\u2028This course will explore controversial and critical journalistic issues and aims to sensitize students to the global geo-political context that underlies the conventions and practices of contemporary journalism. \\u2028\\u2028New challenges include digital journalism redrawing the traditional lines between professional and amateur journalism - with tools like twitter, online news aggregates, and YouTube affecting major revenues sources and the “authority” of news makers. \\u2028\\u2028All of this is taking place against fault lines in the traditional role of news media as a watchdog of democracy and a champion of its citizenry’s right to know – not to mention some gutsy and perplexing advances by the public relations machine into editorial content.\\u2028\\u2028 Is journalism in danger of losing its place at the heart of democratic society? Are the only journalists telling the truth actually comedians? What purpose does tabloid journalism serve? How has the ubiquity of “The image” change the way we see the world? \\u2028\\u2028By placing journalism in a wider intellectual and historical context, this course seeks to produce a large sense of journalism as a vocation as it relates to politics and civic life. Some topics looked at include:\\u2028\\u2028*journalism’s role in a democracy\\u2028*reporting conflict, terrorism and war\\u2028*the future of investigative journalism\\u2028*race and ideology\\u2028*the image\\u2028*global civil society \\u2028\\u2028With that in mind, Critical Issues in Journalism will be divided into four units, each encompassing several critical issues:  1. Democracy: press freedoms, recent violations of press freedoms 2. Spin and Media Ownership: fake editorials, gatekeepers 77  3. Diversity:  newsroom debates and critiques of media on gender, race, religion and sexuality 4. Digital Challenges: citizen journalism, twitter, social networking  2. Week-by-week class schedule 3. 78  \\u2028\\u2028Week 1, Sept. 7: Journalism Realities - \\u2028\\u2028Due: course registration, brainstorm session (lecture), 1 test question and answer (seminar)\\u2028\\u2028Lecture: Introduction to the course (overview of topics through case studies) and questions about syllabus. Brainstorming of journalism realities: What is journalism? What are journalists? What have they been and what are they becoming? What is the relation between journalism and democracy? Between journalism and public life? What means have been used to control journalism and journalists? Journalism has had a long and complicated history with democracy. The recent past – post-9/11 – has challenged our conceptions of freedom and rights. The future, particularly with a grinding recession underway, looks uncertain, turbulent and more ideologically charged.\\u2028 Case Study: The Runaway General\\u2028\\u2028 Seminar: Discussion of lecture and readings.

Specifically, the study addresses this larger question in the context of informing the development of the first national terminology guide on the coverage of Aboriginal issues by the Strategic Alliance of Broadcasters for Aboriginal Reflection (hereafter referred to as SABAR).  1.1 What is SABAR? It is important to begin this thesis with a definition of what SABAR is. I will also explain how SABAR came to develop a terminology guide for Aboriginal reporting. SABAR is “a group of Canadian broadcasters and Aboriginal organizations working to increase the contribution and [reflection] of Aboriginal people in all aspects of the Canadian broadcast industry” (SABAR, n.d., About SABAR section, para. 1). Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) and a group of broadcasters and media organizations initiated SABAR in 2003. Since then SABAR has teamed with major broadcasters, educational institutions and Aboriginal groups to facilitate increased participation and more accurate depiction of Aboriginal people in the broadcast industry. Accurate Aboriginal reflection in broadcast journalism is one of SABAR’s primary concerns, and currently there is a significant gap in the area in the Canadian media. SABAR has identified that a key way to address this gap may be through the development of a terminology guide for Aboriginal reporting. This guide will provide a unique contribution to information source for journalists and will represent an important step toward accurately reflecting Aboriginality. The main journalistic guide in Canada, The Canadian Press  2 Stylebook (Tasko, 2010), deals with issues of Aboriginality very tangentially; although the resource is nearly 500-pages in length, only three pages are dedicated to Aboriginal reporting. In other words, SABAR’s guide addresses a critical void in journalistic resources regarding accurate depictions of Aboriginal people. This study draws from interviews with broadcast journalists that were identified by SABAR, asking them what information they believe they need in order to ensure more accurate reporting of Aboriginal people. Past research concerning media and minority relations has often involved content analyses of newspapers and broadcast programs. In this study, however, I work closely with SABAR and deliberately act as a conduit between the group and journalists in order to most effectively inform the development of SABAR’s guide. This methodological approach intends to contribute to the epistemology surrounding the complex relationship between Aboriginal people and journalism.  1.2 Why this Study is Critical This research is important because portrayals of racialized groups in the media shape the way citizens learn about these communities, yet these groups have historically been underrepresented and misrepresented in media accounts, thereby fostering a Eurocentric cultural hegemony (Mahtani, 2001). Media scholars have repeatedly claimed that this type of mistreatment tarnishes the relationship between Aboriginal people and the media (Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2000, 2002; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Mahtani, 2008). Valerie Alia studied the representation of Northern Aboriginal people in three newspapers for a two-year period in the early-1990s. She states, “Northern and [I]ndigenous people receive coverage in ‘mainstream’ media primarily in times of crisis” (p. 144),  3 resulting in a public sphere that comes to associate Northern communities with negative issues. Furthermore, Augie Fleras and Jean Lock Kunz (2001) suggest that the negativity that permeates coverage of Aboriginal affairs “paints a villainous picture of Canada’s [F]irst [P]eoples [sic] 1 , inasmuch as success stories are rarely reported, and those that do succeed are proof of exceptions to the rule” (p. 146). Depicting Aboriginal people in these ways directly opposes Section 3 of the Canadian Broadcasting Act (1991). The act states that Canada’s broadcasting system should, through its programming…serve the needs and interests, and reflect the circumstances and aspirations, of Canadian men, women and children, including equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of [A]boriginal peoples within that society. (1991, Section 3)  Canadian media scholars have pointed out that marginalized groups, and in particular, racialized groups, have repeatedly been demonized and misrepresented in media accounts. However, while there is a growing body of literature that explores that misrepresentation, there remain even fewer academic analyses that focus on the misrepresentation of Aboriginal people (Francis, 1992; Lambertus, 2000). This is an ongoing problem for ethnic minorities, but an even bigger issue epistemologically for Aboriginal people. The media routinely misrepresent Aboriginal people and the impact of these skewed portrayals can have serious social repercussions for those who have been inaccurately reflected in the news. Journalism must be recognized as inaccurate not only when facts are reported incorrectly but also when it fails to reflect the diversity of the communities included in its reports. As David Yarnold (n.d.) notes, “[d]iversity in your content is as important as getting  1  The use of Canada in the possessive form is problematic. More accurate writing would read: “paints a villainous picture of First Peoples in Canada”. In accordance with SABAR’s guide, writers should avoid describing Aboriginal people as “belonging” to Canada.  4 people’s names right. It’s a fundamental component of accuracy” (para. 1). Hanson and Wearden (2004) argue that “[t]he promise to deliver accurate information is at the heart of the unspoken contract that journalists have with their readers and viewers” (p. 546). In this thesis I speak about the important relationship that emerges between misrepresentation and accuracy. In my view, accuracy tends to be defined in narrow terms. While it is the basis of important journalistic practices such as verification, accuracy in journalism can be conceptualized in ways that move beyond its traditional frame of thoroughly researching stories and checking for errors. This study aims to contribute to that conversation by exploring how a commitment to accuracy in journalism includes a commitment to diversity. The literature in communications, journalism and media studies provides the theoretical lens through which I will examine this study. I draw upon research on media diversity initiatives and journalism guides to better understand the role of SABAR’s own guide. I also refer to work that explores conceptualizing accuracy in the role of guides intended to inform diversity in journalism. I now turn to a review of this relevant research.  5 Chapter  2: Literature Review My study explores how the format and content of SABAR’s terminology guide can be informed through interviews with broadcast journalists. This project is embedded in a body of research that explores media-minority relations, journalism guides, and accuracy. To this end, the literature review is comprised of three parts. The first section examines media diversity strategies that have been recommended to alter problematic representations and why they are important. The second addresses how guides fit into these strategies. The third section examines how to conceptualize accuracy in a guide that informs diverse journalism.  2.1  Media Diversity Strategies 2.1.1 In Context: Why Diversity Strategies are Important Scholars have repeatedly pointed out that Aboriginal people are misrepresented and underrepresented in journalistic accounts. Fleras and Kunz study media-minorty relations in Canada. They emphasize that mainstream media supposedly provide a range of viewpoints, uphold neutrality and objectivity, and give fair access to everyone; however, in reality, they “appear to do the opposite when minorities are involved” (2001, p. 1). The authors write that the systematic bias in representations of minorities in the media can be accurately described as media racism: Media racism acknowledges the pervasive influence of both structures and agendas that have an unintended yet negative effect—both systematic and subliminal—of misrepresenting minority women and men…[it is] rooted in those foundational structures and operational principles that systematically define “how things are done around here,” while remaining anchored in a mediacentric mindset that appears beyond challenge, and is secured by subliminal biases that inadvertently deny or exclude. (2001, p. 43-44)   6 Fleras and Kunz found Canadian media were flawed yet not overtly racist, and the people the media routinely mistreats have demanded more inclusive representations in order to better reflect their realities. Drawing on work by media studies scholar Sue Abel (1997), Fleras and Kunz note initiatives for establishing an inclusive media include the following requirements: “(a) the incorporation of minority perspectives into the media process, (b) multicultural programming, (c) balanced and impartial newscasting, and (d) sensitivity training for journalists and decision makers” (2001, p. 157). These are but a few of the recommendations that media scholars offer in order to challenge problematic representations.  Frances Henry and Carol Tator (2002) provide further justification for the development of media diversity strategies. In their book Discourses of Domination: Racial Bias in the Canadian English-Language Press, Henry and Tator apply critical discourse analysis to a series of case studies found in the Canadian print media (specifically, articles were taken from the Globe and Mail, National Post, Regina Leader Post, Saskatoon Star Phoenix, Toronto Star, and Toronto Sun) to study how the media construct racist discourse. They found several discursive themes dominated coverage of the case studies under examination: the discourse of denial; the discourse of political correctness; the discourse of colour evasion or colour blindness; the discourse of equal opportunity; the discourse of blame the victim, or white victimization; the discourses of ‘otherness’; the discourse of national identity; the discourse of moral panic; the discourse of tolerance (p. 228-234). Taken together, they argue that these discourses create an environment of democratic racism (Henry, Tator, Mattis, & Rees, 2000).  Other scholars (Henry & Tator, 2000; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Mahtani, 2002, 2009) mediate on similar but not identical themes. These studies emphasize that racist tropes are  7 subtly and not so subtly integrated and ingrained into journalism. The literature demonstrates that the media are not objective in their reporting, and instead promote discourses that support an ideology that marginalizes minority groups, including Aboriginal people. For example, in an analysis of 128 Vancouver Sun articles about the murdered and missing women in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, Jiwani and Young (2006) note the “persistent signification of Aboriginality” (p. 910). They found that the continual inclusion of Ernie Crey, the brother of one of the murdered women and himself the former United First Nations president, “served the function of fixing Aboriginality as a sign of the missing and murdered women” (p. 910). Here, the media made direct linkages among crime, violence, prostitution and Aboriginality, further marginalizing the women.  While racist discourses marginalize and oppress those outside the mainstream, some groups have responded by resisting them. Henry and Tator (2002) observe that writers of colour and First Nations writers, minority community groups, and the ethnic media have all made moves to provide oppositional discourses, thereby offering alternative voices in the news (p. 237-238). Additionally, the authors underscore the need for media workers to practice greater reflexivity on the job to support diversity, Journalists and editors need to understand how their own social identities, histories, and frames of reference affect their work; and how whiteness acts as a filter, screening out the contradictions and complexities of issues related to race and racism, culture and ethnicity, and other social phenomena. (2002, p. 239)  Henry and Tator’s research demonstrates that there is no single solution to the problems that permeate Canadian news media, and a range of diversity initiatives is required. Specifically, media diversity strategies that target inaccurate representation of minority groups can help remedy the ongoing misrepresentation of those communities by providing journalists with the necessary resources to produce more informed journalism.  8  One strategy that continually surfaces in the literature is the inclusion of the perspectives of minority journalists to inform the production of news. However, some suggest that accurate reflection does not necessarily follow inclusion. For example, in Deadlines and Diversity: Journalism Ethics in a Changing World (1996), Bud White Eye, an Aboriginal reporter, recalls his struggles at the London Free Press in Ontario during the early-1990s, I told them that if I do a story, I want it done the way I do it. I’m a First Nations writer, this is a First Nations perspective, a First Nations writing style. If you change it to your way, there’s no sense having me. You might as well go out and do it yourself. After 145 years of existence, I don’t think the Free Press had ever had a First Nations writer before I got there. To finally have a First Nations writer and say, “We want your style, we want your perspective,” then go back to the office and start making changes—how on earth can you edit a First Nations person’s style or content if you’ve never worked with one before? How can you get that different flavour if you start changing things?...Unless you come out of a school of journalism assimilated and write like mainstream white journalists, they don’t want you. (p. 96)  Despite the diversity White Eye could offer—the “flavour”, as he calls it—his perspective was not valued. Leslie Joynt notes this issue of invisibility is “discouragingly familiar” (1995, para. 3) in Canadian newsrooms.  The misrepresentation of Aboriginal people in journalistic accounts is a global problem. Australian academic Michael Meadows (1994) suggests that Aboriginal people are “probably the most misrepresented of all because of their place within colonial discourse” (p. 64), and although contemporary coverage in the media may have shifted from portraying Aboriginal peoples as victims to threats, “in essence, [I]ndigenous issues remain stereotyped or, as is more likely to be the case, omitted from the discourse” (p. 64). As a result, Aboriginal communities have culturally appropriated technologies such as satellite television and community radio “essentially as a response to a perceived racist mainstream media representation and a technologist-driven media environment” (p. 64). Meadows refers to the  9 imposition of satellite broadcasting systems on Australia and Canada to illustrate this appropriation. For instance, the Warlpiri, a group of Indigenous Australians, developed the Tanami Network—an integration of videoconferencing and satellite technologies—to connect four Tanami Desert communities with the rest of the world. As an example, videoconferencing is used to contact family, deliver educational and training courses, and remotely diagnose medical cases. Meadows suggests a telecommunications system of this kind has considerable implications for local broadcasting by Aboriginal communities, and it “demonstrates the possibility for empowerment inherent in such technology” (p. 67). By adopting and appropriating television and radio technologies, Aboriginal communities create a new kind of media that challenges the very same mainstream systems that prompted development of these different forms in the first place. Meadows makes the connection between Indigenous media production and media diversity strategies clear: “Through their inherent notions of potential empowerment, such [I]ndigenous initiatives represent a radical opposition to the cultural hegemony of mass media” (p. 71).  Journalism scholar Mercedes Lynn de Uriarte (2003) examined media reform within the context of media coverage of Latinos in the United States and Mexico. Since the mid- 1800s, when newspapers named the first American foreign correspondent to cover the country’s war with Mexico, de Uriarte found that “accuracy has, more often than not, been distorted by a grid of xenophobia, racism, ignorance and social distance” (p. 39). Through mistreatment by the media, Latinos experienced “exclusion, stereotype, a propensity of negative and distorted coverage, low participation in mainstream media and almost no opportunity themselves to provide alternative points of view” (p. 40-41). de Uriarte found these same problems also influence African Americans, Asians Americans and American  10 Indians (p. 41). To accurately cover Latino communities, journalists require a better understanding of the context of their stories. [T]he press must overcome an ignorance of history. Although newsroom guidelines and press ethics abound, neither substitute for in-depth knowledge of the people being covered. Recognition of context requires a good grasp of history. Few schools or universities prepare students to perceive a multicultural America, or to understand that minority groups are neither a new phenomenon nor an insignificant one. But because they do not appear in depth in most textbooks and they still have not been acknowledged in society’s major institutions, most minority groups remain invisible. Their past is unknown, their present obscured. (p. 53)  de Uriarte notes that while coverage of Latinos is generally better and more abundant than it was in the past, it must continue to improve, and the best strategy for improvement is greater familiarity with Latinos and other minority communities on the part of journalists.  Dori Maynard (2011) suggests the conversation around diversity in journalism needs to be reframed. She points to the “changing demographics and growing gulf between journalists and the communities they cover” (para. 1) as evidence that commitments from news organizations to accurately reflect the country have not been renewed. Maynard argues that if diversity is not a priority then it is time to admit it; conversely, if it really is important then it is time to invest energy in ways to diversify the media.  The above literature provides the context for why media diversity strategies are important. Scholars have exposed the continuing problems involving the coverage of Aboriginal people in journalism, thereby providing the impetus for diversity initiatives. I will now review a number of these strategies in practice.  2.1.2 In Practice: Diversity Strategies at Work The majority of media diversity strategies discussed in this thesis have been implemented in the United States. The country’s oldest professional journalistic organization,  11 the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), is an example. The encouragement of diversity in journalism is listed among the society’s missions (SPJ, 1996-2011, Our Mission section). As such, the SPJ developed the Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook. The sourcebook is a compilation of names and contact information for experts in areas ranging from agriculture to health and medicine to technology and is intended to encourage better sourcing by journalists. The experts listed in the sourcebook are from groups “historically underrepresented in the media: women, gays and lesbians, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities” (The Quill, 1999). The sourcebook addresses a critical aspect of media diversity: who is quoted. This is a particularly important question given the prevalence of non-minority voices in the news. In a study of new sources in five British Press newspapers, Teun A. van Dijk (1991) found “that minority group members are quoted less often and less extensively than majority group members, even when the topics directly concern them, and even if there are minority experts available to give an opinion” (p. 174). In addition to the Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook, SPJ’s website offers a Diversity Toolbox (SPJ, 1996-2011, Diversity Toolbox section). This digital storage space is filled with other strategies for creating an inclusive media environment, like suggestions for language use and tips on smarter reporting.  The Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education (MIJE) is an organization committed to promoting diversity in journalism. Co-founded in 1977 by Robert C. Maynard, himself an African American journalist, the institute helps news media reflect the country’s diversity in content, staffing, and operations (Maynard Institute, 2011, About section, para. 1). Notable among MIJE’s initiatives is its Fault Lines training program. Developed by Maynard, the program is a tool for journalists and teachers alike, functioning as “a means through which social debate may be analyzed to strengthen the depth, the thoroughness and  12 the social representation of our classroom and journalistic content” (Miller & Hsu, 2008, p. 118). Maynard identified five Fault Lines: race (including ethnicity), class, gender (including sexual orientation), generation and geography. These Fault Lines frame the ways in which people better see themselves, and more broadly, the world (Miller & Hsu, 2008, p. 119). The program challenges journalists and students to expand their definition of diversity by moving beyond the stale conceptualization of diversity as an issue of race and gender. It was Maynard’s belief that the Fault Lines framework “would help enable teachers and the media to fully, fairly and accurately represent the entire community with regard to whatever the social or philosophical issue” (Miller & Hsu, 2008, p. 119). Comprehensive training is an important component of diversifying the media. An additional diversity initiative aimed at educating journalists is The Authentic Voice: The Best Reporting on Race and Ethnicity (2006), an instructional guide for both journalism students and industry professionals. Building on award-winning stories featured in the “Let’s Do It Better!” Workshop on Journalism, Race and Ethnicity at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism—a media diversity strategy in itself—The Authentic Voice is a three-prong approach to providing accurate race and ethnicity reporting: the resource integrates a textbook, a DVD, and a website. Each story presented is a case of what the authors deem to be examples of best practices in journalism. The aforementioned “Let’s Do It Better!” Workshop was developed in part by Arlene Morgan, former assistant managing editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer and current Associate Dean at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. The project was based on improving journalism by critiquing stories that were already in the paper (Morgan, 2008, p. 131). Morgan structured a pilot workshop around a controversial story that appeared in her  13 former newspaper. Twenty randomly selected editors, reporters, photographers, copy editors, and graphic artists debated the strengths and weaknesses of the story. The conversations were moderated, and Morgan says what evolved was an honest discussion on race reporting, noting the project’s success is rooted in its bottom line: making journalism better (2008, p. 133). The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism adopted Morgan’s workshop idea in 1999 and she has been director of the program since 2000. Another strategy geared towards promoting an inclusive media through education is the Forum on Diversity, a project of the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University. The forum “is based on the ideas that representative and diverse coverage can determine the success of the news industry, and better journalism/mass communication education will help achieve this goal” (Forum on Media Diversity, 2011, About section, para. 2). To this end, the forum offers a list of media diversity syllabi submitted by teachers and professors from across the United States to aid in the development of curricula and to help improve teaching. The Forum on Diversity’s website provides the rationale for creating such a list: “Teaching is the heart of good journalism/mass communication programs, and diversity is the heart of good teaching. Good ideas contribute to good teaching, and good ideas are better if they’re shared” (Forum on Media Diversity, 2011, Media Diversity Syllabi section, para. 1). Additionally, the forum hosts seminars and conferences pertaining to media diversity, and the results of one conference on diversity in communication media and higher education yielded the Diversity That Works (2008) report. This work includes personalized reports from conference participants on specific diversity initiatives undertaken by his or her educational or media institute. According to Ralph Izard, editor of the report, The Manship School “hope[s] to provide a source of ideas that may be  14 locally adapted in a way that helps others achieve greater excellence in the educational opportunities they provide their students” (2008, p. 7). I have provided context for why media diversity strategies are important, and I have also reviewed various initiatives at work. It is critical to note that not one of the strategies reviewed specifically targets Aboriginal representation. I will now explore how journalism guides fit into these strategies.  2.2 Guides as a Component of Media Diversity Strategies In journalism there are guides that govern journalists in their work, some of which fit into media diversity strategies like those reviewed above, thereby helping journalists navigate the complex topics of race and ethnicity. A review of these guides underscores the need for a resource dedicated solely to Aboriginal reporting, because even when Aboriginality is addressed in the guides the information is limited. In Canada, the Radio-Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) produced a comprehensive toolkit titled Everyone’s Story: Reflecting Canada’s Diversity (2007) to help broadcasters across the country reflect diversity. The bilingual guide and accompanying DVD include tips on proper language use, with lists of inclusive terms; diversity checklists for reporters, editors, management, and the newsroom; and sections for covering Aboriginal people and people with disabilities. (The guide dedicates five pages to Aboriginal people and the media.) According to Renato Zane, then Chair of RTNDA’s Diversity Committee, it is the hope of the organization that, above all, the guide will be used to “find ways to reflect diversity in everything your newsroom does – from administration to story development to  15 on-air delivery to community relations” (2007, p. 5). Zane also notes that if diversity is built into daily routines, then news organizations will benefit (2007, p. 5). As previously mentioned, in the United States the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) offers a Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook “to broaden the perspectives represented in the media” (The Quill, 1999). The book contains names and contact information for experts in a wide range of areas. All of the experts are from groups not commonly represented in the media, such as ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. Acting as a searchable database of experts from underrepresented demographic groups, the resource promotes diversity in sourcing, thus resisting the bias that results from a homogenous pool of sources. van Dijk (1991) underscores the need for diverse sources, Possible biases in the coverage of ethnic affairs not only reside in the selection and prominence of news actors, but also in the ways they are presented as speakers who give their interpretation of, and opinions about news events. (p. 151).   Guides fit into diversity strategies in other ways. Colorlines.com is an American daily news site that covers racial justice issues (Colorlines, n.d., About Us section, para. 1). The site provides an Immigration Stylebook that “outlines why Colorlines.com writers don't use the i-word, ‘illegals,’ in any form to describe people” (Colorlines, n.d., Colorline.com’s Immigration Stylebook section, para. 1). The guide is a resource for journalists looking to cover immigration fairly and accurately. Among the reasons Colorlines.com lists for dropping the i-word is the fact that the word is legally inaccurate (Colorlines, n.d., Colorline.com’s Immigration Stylebook section, para. 3). Inaccurate news reports of immigrants can have serious ramifications. Writing from a Canadian perspective, Mahtani (2008) notes, Racial minorities, and new immigrants to Canada from minority racialized groups in particular, are often presented as threats to the nation-state, and non-White groups are  16 portrayed consistently as mysterious or inscrutable, or linked invariably to crime and deviant patterns of behaviour. (p. 640)  Colorline.com’s Immigration Stylebook can aid journalists in avoiding these negative portrayals, thereby providing a more accurate and fair representation of immigrants in the news.  The Center for Integration & Improvement of Journalism’s News Watch Diversity Style Guide (n.d.) and the Media Diversity Institute’s Reporting Diversity Manual (2002) are two more guides. The former is a comprehensive list of terms compiled with the help of various ethnic media organizations and industry professionals. The latter is a series of case studies analyzing where U.S. and European newspapers went wrong in reporting diversity, and what journalists can do to fix the mistakes. Both resources act as components of media diversity strategies by providing journalists with guidelines for accurate representation of minorities in the news, of which the positive outcomes are plentiful. According to Milica Pesic, executive director of the Media Diversity Institute, As journalists, we have a unique opportunity to facilitate the process of reconciliation. We possess the ability to help all members of our communities express their needs and desires. We have the power to help eliminate stereotypes and misrepresentations of ethnic, racial and religious minorities within our societies. And we have the authority to shape the discussion and define the areas of common ground through accurate, unbiased reporting. (Tuller, 2002, p. 14)    2.3 Conceptualizing Accuracy in a Diversity Guide I opened this study with the assertion that a commitment to accuracy in journalism includes a commitment to diversity. My comment thus warrants an exploration of how to conceptualize accuracy in a guide that informs diversity in journalism.  17 The debate surrounding journalism accuracy can be framed by interrogating not only what is wrong, but also what is missing; as Nick Russell reminds us, “truth can be distorted by omission as much as by commission” (2006, p. 38). This alternative approach to situating accuracy is particularly significant in the context of reflecting diversity in journalism, where different journalistic practices often work to silence voices outside of the mainstream. To this end, the Associated Press Managing Editors diversity committee produced a report (The National Time-Out for Diversity and Accuracy, 1999) based on the following premise, We want to accurately reflect life in our communities. If our newspapers are not inclusive enough to regularly portray the diversity of those communities, then we are presenting a fundamentally inaccurate report. That lack of accuracy undermines our journalistic credibility. (Associated Press Managing Editors, The Premise section, para. 1)  While not all participants involved in the project agreed with the premise—some felt it went too far, others thought it could be edited—the report expands the industry’s understanding of accuracy by linking diversity and credibility. In fact, of the 150 newsrooms that took part in the project, 85 reported “that they felt reframing the issue of diversity as an issue of accuracy was an idea they wanted to continue to pursue” (Associated Press Managing Editors, Executive Summary section, para. 14).  The above report sheds light onto how to reconceptualize accuracy. Historically, inaccurate journalism has been identified by common errors: botched names and titles, typos, and misreported numbers (Silverman, 2007). While seemingly simple to correct, even slight errors can affect journalistic credibility. In fact, decades of research (Charnley, 1936; Berry, 1967; Lawrence & Grey, 1969; Scanlon, 1972; Tankard Jr. & Ryan, 1974) look at journalism accuracy in newspapers. Mitchell Charnley introduced the first method of measuring newspaper accuracy in 1936 and subsequent scholars have expanded upon his seminal work.  18 Other studies (Singletary & Lipsky, 1977; Moore & Singletary, 1985; Hanson & Wearden, 2004) address accuracy within a television context. This collection of literature demonstrates that accuracy has escaped the press to some degree since it was first measured nearly eighty years ago, a problematic reality considering two national surveys in the United States found “inaccuracy hurts the news media’s credibility” (Hanson & Wearden, 2005, p. 546).  The importance of factually accurate reports cannot be denied, and journalism that accurately reflects the diversity of communities deserves the same treatment; diversity guides provide a means to this end. For example, the Rainbow Diversity Sourcebook (SPJ, 1996- 2011) compiled by the Society of Professional Journalists promotes better sourcing to accurately reflect diversity. Colorline.com’s Immigration Stylebook (Colorlines, n.d.) urges journalists to refrain from using the term “illegal” to describe immigrants because it is legally inaccurate. The Freedom Forum’s Best Practices for Newspaper Journalists (n.d.) notes that newspapers are unfair when they lack diversity, and that, “[t]he newspapers attacking the problem most effectively are following a carefully defined strategy of best practices” (p. 45) including the requirement for reporters to have their own “rainbow Rolodexes” (n.d., p. 46). What these examples demonstrate is that accuracy in a guide that informs diversity is not so much about checking for spelling or factual errors—again, that is how accuracy has been conceptualized historically—but rather, more about capturing the diversities of the communities journalists cover. In the forward to The Authentic Voice (2006), David Yarnold reflects on the measures his former employer, a newspaper, took to diversify its staff and content, clearly summarizing how accuracy can be reconceptualized in terms of diversity, We came to understand why it’s important to have a voice that authentically reflects readers or viewers: It’s a question of accuracy. All journalists want their work to be viewed as accurate…And in order for our news reports to be fundamentally accurate, we must reflect the entire community. Because if, over time, our news pages or  19 broadcasts represent only narrow segments of the community, how can we consider our work to be an accurate depiction of the places where we live? (p. xi-xii)   Scholars have suggested that Aboriginal communities have been continually misrepresented and underrepresented in journalism, thereby underscoring the need for information sources that can assist in rectifying the ongoing mistreatment; yet a survey of existing journalistic resources reveals a lack of information for accurately covering Aboriginal communities. Thus, SABAR’s guide is important because it will offer journalists a way to be more accurate in their portrayals of Aboriginal people. SABAR’s guide represents a significant—and unprecedented—step toward informing accuracy in Aboriginal reporting.  The above selection of literature provides the theoretical grounding for my own work. What this research explores are the connections among media diversity strategies, journalism guides, and reconceptualizing accuracy in a diversity guide, and how these areas of study can link together in support of accurate reflection of all minority groups, in this case through the effective implementation of SABAR’s terminology guide. Before examining these findings, however, I will first outline the methods used in this study.  20 Chapter  3: Methodology 3.1 Research Approach This study examines what a small sample of broadcast journalists suggest should be included in SABAR’s terminology guide for Aboriginal reporting, as well as informing the guide’s form and medium.  It employs qualitative research methodologies in the form of semi-structured interviews with a select group of journalists identified by SABAR in order to best inform the guide’s development. Qualitative interviews are a suitable way to investigate answering this question because they “are conversations in which a researcher gently guides a conversational partner in an extended conversation” so that “each conversation is unique, as researchers match their questions to what each interviewee knows and is willing to share” (Rubin & Rubin, p. 4). Furthermore, qualitative interviews situate the researcher in the real world and are therefore appropriate for studying things “in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them” (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000, p. 3).  I chose to interview broadcast journalists about their perspectives on SABAR’s guide. My method was developed in conjunction with SABAR because I believe in the value of transparent methodological approaches, as proposed by Linda Tuhiwai Smith and other Aboriginal researchers. As such, my approach encompasses Aboriginal perspectives and ways of knowing, thus resisting the Western epistemological standpoint that dominates much of the research involving Aboriginal communities. This approach is intentionally influenced by Aboriginality and is often described as “decolonizing”. Decolonizing research methods is a critical step in Aboriginal research. In the opening page of Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples (1999), Smith makes explicit the conflicted relationship  21 between Aboriginal people and research: “The word itself, ‘research’, is probably one of the dirtiest words in the indigenous world’s vocabulary” (p. 1). Within an indigenous context, research is inextricably linked to colonialism because it assumes a Western cultural standpoint. More precisely, Smith writes that Western research, brings to bear, on any study of indigenous peoples, a cultural orientation, a set of values, a different conceptualization of such things as time, space and subjectivity, different and competing theories of knowledge, highly specialized forms of language, and structures of power. (p. 42)  Recognizing the position from which research has historically been conducted illuminates the ways in which Western researchers have collected knowledge about Aboriginal groups and then presented it to the West, thereby claiming authority over the people. My approach borrows heavily from the work of Aboriginal researchers, who insist that much of the research on Aboriginal people has adopted a colonial mentality (Mihesuah, 1998; Smith, 1999; Restoule, 2005) and Aboriginal communities have often been exploited in the process. I therefore aim to break away from the colonial themes that permeate Western research by respecting the value of an Aboriginal-inspired approach to this project.  3.2 Research Question My research question is: What do a small sample of broadcast journalists believe would be most valuable to include in SABAR’s terminology guide in order to produce an accessible, accurate resource to inform the depiction of Aboriginal people in journalism?  3.3 Interviews For this study I interviewed broadcast journalists from some of SABAR’s member organizations. Questions addressed themes that included the value and necessity of an  22 Aboriginal-specific resource, how SABAR’s guide compared to other journalistic guides, the types of information journalists need to accurately report on Aboriginal issues, and how this information could be most effectively presented and then delivered. I asked journalists to draw upon their personal experiences in telling Aboriginal stories, as well as their familiarity with other journalism guides, to elicit suggestions as to how the format of SABAR’s guide can be most effectively organized. As such, this study requires a flexible research technique that allows participants to expand upon areas in which they are most knowledgeable. Qualitative research scholars Herbert J. Rubin and Irene S. Rubin call this approach to interviewing semi-structured (2005, p. 4).  I interviewed eleven broadcast journalists from seven different media organizations across Canada, all SABAR members and chosen by the organization. I did not choose the interviewees myself. SABAR provided me with a list of potential interviewees.  The individuals who responded to my call for interviews worked at a variety of media organizations, including Astral Media, APTN, CBC, CTV News, Global News, OMNI, and The Weather Network. The interviews gave participants an opportunity to voice how they think the guide should be organized.  3.3.1 Participant Recruitment I interviewed participants after SABAR’s executive board recommended them to me. I drafted a letter that was distributed at a SABAR meeting in January of 2011 (see Appendix A). The letter included information about the study and asked board members to provide the contact information for two potential participants within their media organizations. I clearly  23 stated that ideally the individuals should be journalists with some experience and/or interest in Aboriginal reporting. Once I was provided with the contact information for possible interviewees I sent each journalist a formal email introducing my study and myself. I outlined the procedure and what their involvement in the project would entail. I followed up my initial message with another email or a telephone call to confirm participation. Next, an interview time was arranged with those willing to participate. In preparation for each interview I sent participants SABAR’s draft guide, as well as a consent form for their completion, as required by the University of British Columbia’s Research Ethics Board. The consent form allowed interviewees to choose between being identified in the study or remaining anonymous. Most chose to be named and those who opted for confidentiality will not be in this project. Interviews were conducted in person or on the telephone depending on the preference and location of each participant. All interviews took place in private settings.  3.3.2 Data Collection and Analysis The data in this study comes from the open-ended, semi-structured qualitative interviews I conducted with eleven broadcast journalists working for SABAR member organizations across Canada. Most interviews were approximately an hour long. I formulated a set of questions based on the objectives of my research (see Appendix C), and although I drew from the same list of questions for all the interviews, my approach was flexible enough to allow participants to focus on the issues that they found most important and spend less time on others. Each interview was recorded with the participants’ permission and then  24 transcribed for further analysis. Participants received a copy of the transcription for review within one month of the date of the interview.  After the data was collected I analyzed each transcript to identify concepts and themes that appeared throughout the interviews. A concept is “a word or term that represents an idea important to your research problem,” and themes are, “summary statements and explanations of what is going on” (Rubin & Rubin, 2005, p. 207). My method for examining the material I gathered draws upon Rubin and Rubin’s approach to coding, in which concepts and themes that arise in the interviews are labeled in accordance with a key of codes that include definitions to recognize when important issues are present in the data (2005, p. 207). The main concepts and themes that I identified are discussed in the final analysis.  3.3.3 Research Limitations No study is without research limitations and it is therefore important to recognize those present in my own. To begin, the sample size is small. While I interviewed precisely the type of person this study required—participant recruitment was not random, after all—the number was limited to eleven. A larger pool of participants would most likely yield a wider array of data. Moreover, the results are not generalizable. The guide in question deals with information related to Aboriginal people, their cultures, and their histories, and although this study examines the value guides have in ameliorating representation of minorities in the media, my findings are specific to SABAR’s guide. However, although the sample size is small, it does yield some important findings that I elaborate upon later in the thesis. My research intends to shed light on initiatives designed to accurately reflect diversity in the news media, thereby functioning as a referent for similar studies. To this end, my work is  25 modeled according to the research design laid out by Rubin and Rubin: carefully selected interviewees with special attention paid to thoroughness, accuracy and believability (2005, 64-78).                    26 Chapter  4: Findings and Discussion In this section, I summarize the key findings from interviews conducted with broadcast journalists regarding what they believe would be most valuable to include in order to produce an accessible, accurate guide to inform the depiction of Aboriginal people in journalism. I will suggest that there are three key findings: SABAR’s guide is greatly needed, journalists have ideas for what the resource should contain to support accurate Aboriginal reflection, and online access to the guide is the quickest and easiest delivery method.  4.1 SABAR’s Proposed Guide is Necessary and Long Overdue Through the course of the interviews is became evident that SABAR’s terminology guide addresses a void in information sources for journalists, suggesting that one of the key findings of this study concerned an industry-wide need for a guide that supports accurate Aboriginal reporting. This section presents reasons why SABAR’s guide is a necessary contribution to existing journalistic resources, particularly in the absence of other Aboriginal- specific guides. It concludes with an interpretation of this study’s first key finding.  4.1.1 The Guide is Needed and SABAR’s Contribution is Exciting One of the most important findings to emerge from the qualitative interviews involved the unanimous need for a guide of this nature. All the participants said that the guide is important and they were enthusiastic about using it. Curt Petrovich, a national reporter for CBC Radio News in Vancouver, British Columbia, has been reporting on Aboriginal communities for about 25 years. He explained why SABAR’s guide would make a valuable reference tool for journalists covering Aboriginal communities,  27 The truth is, in I don’t know how many newsrooms, you often have people who have never been to a First Nation, they’ve never been on a reserve, they have no sense or concept of any of this, so having [the guide] on hand would be useful for a great number of journalists, particularly junior journalists who just haven’t done this kind of coverage before (Petrovich, personal communication, April 15, 2011).  Kelly Noseworthy, a bureau correspondent for The Weather Network in Oakville, Ontario, insisted on the importance of the guide for all journalists, stating that the distribution of the guide should not be limited to SABAR members only; everyone in the industry should have access to the resource, hence emphasizing its value (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011). Journalists interviewed did not know of a comparable current resource in Canada and were excited about SABAR’s draft. Even Petrovich and Paul Barnsley, the executive producer for APTN Investigates in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said they had never seen a guide of this type (Petrovich, personal communication, April 15, 2011; Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011), a significant finding considering the two journalists have over 43 years of combined experience in Aboriginal reporting. In fact, only one participant remembered encountering a specific guide regarding Aboriginality. Jessica Lyall is a senior news writer for OMNI Television in Toronto, Ontario. She said at some point in her career she had come across Everyone’s Story: Reflecting Canada’s Diversity (2007), a user guide produced by the Radio-Television News Directors Association (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). The guide only devoted a short section to Aboriginal people and the media. Journalists need detailed information to produce news reports that are both accurate and culturally sensitive, an especially important objective in Aboriginal reporting. Noseworthy suggested:  28 I think the whole point [of the guide] is to make sure that we’re all accurate and the information is the same, because if you flip from one channel to the next I’m sure you’ll see varying degrees of the same report, and who knows who is accurate and who is not. And the thing is, when you’re reporting on something like Aboriginal history or Aboriginal culture or Aboriginal religion, Aboriginal treaties and land claims and whatever, you better be accurate (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011).  Noseworthy added that SABAR’s guide could replace other resources journalists may consult when covering Aboriginal affairs, such as Internet search engines like Google: “Not everything that’s on Google is the truth, and that’s where people are getting their information from” (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011). The interview material suggests SABAR’s guide fills a void in resources for journalists covering Aboriginal affairs because it provides the comprehensive and accurate information they need.  4.1.2 The Guide Will Play a Critical Role in Training Broadcasters Another important theme that emerged during the interviews was the role SABAR’s terminology guide could play in training journalists in all stages of their careers. First, the guide could supplement a lack of training on the part of journalists. Not one of the eleven participants interviewed received any formal training or lessons in covering Aboriginal stories either at journalism school or since entering the industry. Those who were more familiar with Aboriginal people and their histories had taken it upon themselves to learn more in support of accurate journalism. One participant who wished to remain anonymous in this study is a network correspondent for a television station in Eastern Canada. She explained, I always try to sort of find, okay, what’s the right word, what do you use, and try to make it as culturally sensitive as possible and accurate. So a lot of that was just personal, and I think that that’s the problem is that you have people who may not be as dedicated to—well, not that they don’t care, they’re just busy and rushing toward a  29 deadline and they’re trying to sort of just get it done as quickly and easily as possible (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  Second, SABAR’s guide could play an important part in training new journalists. When questioned about other guides and how they learned about them, participants said that for the most part they were introduced to the guides at school or at work as part of their own training process. However, most interviewed explained to me that they were never introduced to a guide on how to cover Aboriginal communities more accurately. The implications here are tremendous. SABAR’s guide could be given to new hires as part of their introduction to a job. As a senior news writer, Lyall said she would encourage new writers to use the guide when necessary: “It’s the type of thing that, you know, a new writer gets hired, I’m going to hand them [the guide] and say, ‘Listen, if you ever need to, this is what you refer to’” (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). SABAR’s guide has the opportunity to become the authoritative source on Aboriginal reporting by training new journalists ways to accurately cover stories. Third, journalists discussed the guide serving as a useful reference for providing ways to accurately reflect Aboriginality in their work, especially when they are not regularly assigned to cover Aboriginal news stories. Some of the participants explained they are general assignment reporters and are not presented with a lot of opportunities to report on Aboriginal affairs, and thus need to be reminded about the meanings of terms or the complex history of Aboriginal people in Canada. The interview material suggests that journalists are not adequately trained in the nuances of Aboriginal reporting and SABAR’s guide could help rectify these inadequacies, thereby serving as an authoritative resource in the area.    30 4.1.3 Guide Provides Necessary Context The information contained in SABAR’s guide supports journalists’ efforts to properly represent the communities they cover, with the aim that Aboriginality will be accurately reflected in their work. Journalists can tell complex stories by providing the necessary layers of context and background information. And having this type of information can advance stories. As Justine Lewkowicz, a reporter and anchor for NewsTalk 1010 in Toronto, Ontario, described, Well anytime in news that you’re covering something it’s important to have a reference point, or sort of, you know, what’s happening with Aboriginal issues in Ontario is related somehow to Aboriginal issues in Nunavut, or in BC, or whatnot. To know the background of the story is really important, to know what kinds of questions you should be asking about the issue happening right now (Lewkowicz, personal communication, March 18, 2011).  Having sufficient contextual information can also assist journalists in being respectful. A concern that journalists may cause offense toward Aboriginal people is a concept that often surfaced during the interviews. The study’s anonymous participant explained how improper language use could be offensive: I think people are, journalists in particular, are nervous about making mistakes and offending people and so they tend to use language which is either old and inaccurate or really, really safe and too wide-sweeping because they don’t want to upset people and they don’t want to be wrong (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  The anonymous participant also discussed the ramifications of improper language combined with a lack of background information when journalists are in the field talking to Aboriginal people in their own communities. She said journalists have to build trust with their sources and that “you can’t build trust if you don’t have the proper language and you don’t understand what these communities have been through” (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011). The interviews suggest SABAR’s guide could help journalists  31 communicate the complexities of the communities they cover in ways that avoid causing offense by providing essential context.  4.1.4 Interpreting the Findings The interview material demonstrates that participants believed SABAR’s guide could assist journalists in reflecting Aboriginality more accurately. These findings are in line with a couple of the requirements that Fleras and Kunz (2001) lay out for strategies that promote a diverse and inclusive media: “balanced and impartial newscasting and…sensitivity training for journalists and decision makers” (p. 157) The literature examining the long history of misrepresentation and underrepresentation in the media of minorities in general, and Aboriginal people in particular, underpins the need for resources like SABAR’s. Some of the participants also touched upon this routine mistreatment and they noted that SABAR’s guide is not only necessary but also long overdue. In fact, every participant said they would use the guide. Even those well versed in Aboriginal reporting showed appreciation for the resource, although they noted they might not need to use it as often as their less experienced colleagues. Above all, participants emphasized that they would be eager to see a guide like this in newsrooms, and emphatically pointed out that they would use a guide to inform their own storytelling approaches.  4.2 Content: What SABAR’s Guide Should Look Like The content of SABAR’s guide is another important theme that emerged during the interviews. While all the journalists interviewed were enthusiastic about the draft document, they still had ideas for how the guide could be improved to further inform accurate  32 Aboriginal depiction in their work. Participants discussed additions to the guide and explained how the added content could help them. They also talked about the most effective ways of presenting the information so as many of their colleagues as possible would use the guide. This section presents what journalists think SABAR’s guide should look like. It ends with an interpretation of the second key finding.  4.2.1 Journalists Want a List of Aboriginal Contacts An important finding that surfaced during the interviews is that journalists want a list of contacts within Aboriginal communities to inform the development of a story. Many journalists said the list would help them locate the best sources for a story, an important consideration when attempting to accurately capture the diversities of Aboriginal people. As the anonymous participant described, Journalists tend to have very, very tight deadlines, they often need information quickly, and so they might make a phone call and it could go to an old voicemail that’s incorrect, that’s the number that’s listed, and then no one calls them back by their deadline, and then the information that goes to print or on air isn’t as up-to-date or as accurate as it could be (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  Laurel Clark, a television reporter for Global Edmonton in Alberta, talked about how journalists can provide better coverage of Aboriginal people by tapping into contacts on a local scale, If we were to have a list of experts and contacts at the community level, that would be great because those people, you know, you might not think of calling them but you call them up and then you get some great story, some success story…and then you’re offering more balanced coverage (Clark, personal communication, March 25, 2011).  Carol Charles is a reporter and video journalist for CTV News Toronto in Ontario. She also said would like a list of contacts added to the guide. She said if she needed to speak  33 to someone to address her questions or concerns, or if she required clarification, a contact list would provide quick and easy access to the applicable sources (Charles, personal communication, March 17, 2011). Including a list of contacts in SABAR’s guide would assist journalists in accurate Aboriginal reflection by offering a range of diverse voices. Furthermore, because the list would be compiled by SABAR, those journalists referencing it could be confident that the contacts listed are considered by SABAR to be authorities in their respective areas.  4.2.2 Suggested Additions All of the journalists interviewed suggested additions to SABAR’s guide that would assist them in accurately reflecting Aboriginality in their work, the most common of which included maps and pronunciation guides. While participants usually explained their reasoning for these two additions it should be noted that they were both included in the original question (see Appendix A for the list of questions), and my own suggestion may have influenced the responses. Having acknowledged that, a review of these suggested additions, and others, is necessary.  As mentioned above, maps were a common addition suggested by journalists. Rob Smith is a reporter and video journalist for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) in Vancouver, British Columbia. He said he would like to see the addition of several kinds of maps, Certainly maps would be helpful, not only traditional territory maps but language- grouping maps, political tribal council maps, you know, because you have your First Nations but then you have your tribal councils which comprise up to 14 or 15 First Nations here in B.C., so to see their territory complete would be good. In fact, I want one of those to hang up, I want to be able to see it (Smith, personal communication, April 11, 2011).  34  Barnsley also said different types of maps would be helpful. He said he knows people working in television have been trying to create a comprehensive map showing all the First Nations and reserves in Canada, but lacking sufficient time and resources, they have not been able to complete one (Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011). Maps like those discussed by Smith and Barnsley are useful tools for situating Aboriginal people in Canada and for educating journalists and their audiences.  Correct pronunciation is critical in broadcast journalism and participants were enthusiastic about adding pronunciation guides to SABAR’s guide. Just like improper language use, mispronouncing names, places, and other kinds of terms is inaccurate and can offend people. As Noseworthy explained, making sure journalists have proper pronunciation is a “key element” in accurate Aboriginal reflection (Noseworthy, personal communication, May 9, 2011). Additionally, Lyall said that at OMNI Television she consistently has other broadcast journalists asking her how to pronounce words, and SABAR’s guide could help (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  Some journalists suggested adding specific terms and websites to the guide. Marie Wadden is a radio producer for the CBC Network in St. John’s, Newfoundland. She recommended adding the term “ecocentric” or “ecologically centric” (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011). Both Wadden and Lyall said that “Innu” should be added as a standalone term (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011; Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). The Innu are Naskapi and Montagnais First Nations people who live in Northern Quebec and Labrador. They are often confused with Inuit, but the two groups are distinct. In the draft guide a note appears under Inuvialuit that briefly describes  35 this confusion, but Innu is not actually listed as a term itself. Wadden and Lyall noticed this and suggested it could be added to the glossary.  Other journalists talked about adding the websites for Aboriginal political and leadership organizations to SABAR’s guide. Smith named the websites for the First Nations Summit (www.fns.bc.ca) and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs (www.ubcic.bc.ca) as important additions (Smith, personal communication, April 11, 2011). Similarly, Wadden said she would like to see websites for the Assembly of First Nations (www.afn.ca), Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (www.itk.ca), Pauktuutit (www.pauktuutit.ca), and the Métis National Council (www.metisnation.ca) listed in the guide (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011). These websites offer even more information pertaining to Aboriginal people than is contained in SABAR’s guide, thus providing journalists with further resources that support accurate Aboriginal reflection in the news media. While all participants said they found SABAR’s guide to be a valuable resource for Aboriginal reporting, the interviews suggested that additional information could be added to increase the guide’s helpfulness.  4.2.3 Presenting the Guide’s Content Journalists must work quickly and effectively to meet their deadlines. Some participants suggested categorizing the information in SABAR’s guide according to themes to facilitate usability. (Participants also described these categorizes as sections, chapters, and headings.) Suggestions for categories included religion, politics, culture, and basic terms. Clark said this would make the guide easier to use, One thought that I had was maybe instead of putting terms in alphabetical order you could have them under headings. So for example, you could have one for ‘Culture,’ and under ‘Culture’ you could have terms like ‘Dream Catcher,’ ‘Eagle Feather,’ that kind of thing…because I felt as I was going through [the guide] that I was interested  36 in and curious about the terms but I wonder if I’m a reporter and I’m writing something and I’m on deadline it might be more helpful if it’s organized in a way where it’s under headings (Clark, personal communication, March 25, 2011).  The terms could then be listed alphabetically within each category to further support usability. However, not all participants agreed that the guide should be categorized according to themes. The anonymous participant discussed the pitfalls of the idea: “Sometimes you’re dealing with situations where some reporters, again, who might be kind of new to this, might now know what theme they’re trying to be looking at” (anonymous participant, personal communication, May 4, 2011).  4.2.4 How Content Can Support Accuracy and Authority Providing up-to-date content is an important component of accuracy in terms of a journalism guide. This is significant within the context of SABAR’s guide as government legislation can—and has—changed the terminology used to describe Aboriginal people and their diverse cultures. To this end, participants agreed that SABAR’s guide should be updated regularly to make journalists confident that they are accessing the most accurate content—and to ensure journalists continue using the guide. Participants discussed different time intervals for updating a hardcopy guide and a digital version. Most said that the former should be updated annually and the latter whenever there is a significant change to its contents, thereby making the digital version more current than even the latest paper guide. Additionally, the contents of SABAR’s guide sets an industry standard for accurate terminology and usage, thereby creating the opportunity for the guide to become the leading resource for Aboriginal reporting. But Wadden explained that if SABAR’s guide is to reach this level of authority then leading media organizations must recognize it.  37 I would use the guidebook if, for example, I knew that SABAR’s guidebook had been approved by all the journalistic leaders, like The [Canadian] Press, then I would use it because I would know that this was standard and accepted practice by all the newspapers, you know, so you need to get a stamp, you need to get consensus I think from The Canadian Press and the media leaders. You know, once they all say, oh yeah right, well that’s what we’re going to consider our accepted usage too, then journalists are more likely to use the book (Wadden, personal communication, March 22, 2011).  Lyall said that if SABAR’s guide could garner the type of recognition like that described by Wadden then it “becomes the source, and you don’t really look anywhere else” (Lyall, personal communication, May 4, 2011). She also said that recognition from government bodies and Aboriginal organizations like the Assembly of First Nations would further support the guide’s authority.  4.2.5 Interpreting the Findings This finding is an indication of what journalists think SABAR’s guide should look like in order to improve coverage of Aboriginal people. de Uriarte (2003) claims that “[t]he best resource for better coverage is greater familiarity about Latinos and other minorities on the part of the press” (p. 58). The journalists I interviewed echoed this claim within an Aboriginal context, and they provided suggestions for what the guide could contain to promote familiarity with Aboriginal people.  4.3 Delivery: Accessing SABAR’s Guide Access to the guide was important to many of the journalists interviewed, suggesting that one of the key findings involved ease of use and online availability. In fact, every participant said they would access the guide online and most said they would prefer a digital version to a hardcopy. Interviews still demonstrated support for a printed version, but as  38 traditional forms of journalism (newspapers, TV news, and radio programs) have moved online, it seems that is where journalistic resources should be heading as well. This section presents reasons why journalists advocated for a digital guide, while also providing rationale for the production of a hardcopy. It closes with an interpretation of this study’s final key finding.  4.3.1 Online Resources are Quick, Easy and Accessible A common theme throughout the interviews was that journalists have to find information quickly and easily in response to a perpetual cycle of deadlines. While a hardcopy guide may contain the required information, searching through a book can waste valuable time.  Petrovich suggested building an online guide around a search function to make locating information as quick as possible, We have to be able to have an answer after hitting one enter key on a computer or on a smartphone. So that would be my thing, if there was a way to make it more instant rather than, say, flipping or scrolling through something (Petrovich, personal communication, April 15, 2011).  Other journalists touched upon the connection between an online resource and ease of use. Angie Seth is the lead news anchor for OMNI News: South Asian Edition in Toronto, Ontario. She had this to say: We are at our computers, we are at the mercy of technology every single day, and sadly gone are the days where we grab something from our bookshelf and go through it. But if we had something that was online that was a quick reference it would be easier for us to lookup (Seth, personal communication, May 6, 2011).  The interview material suggests that an online guide would be quicker and easier to use than a hardcopy, hence the overwhelming support for a digital format.  39  An online version of the guide doesn’t just make searching and finding information quick and easy, it also makes that information readily accessible by allowing journalists to consult the guide anywhere they have access to the Internet. Lewkowicz provided the following explanation for her preference for an online guide, When I’m working sometimes I’m in the newsroom, sometimes I’m working off my laptop, sometimes I’m working off my BlackBerry, so if I’m not on the right computer that has the file, or if I can’t get access to my email, I can easily just go to a URL, here’s where the guidebook is, so definitely online (Lewkowicz, personal communication, March 18, 2011).  In fact, like Lewkowicz, most study participants said they use some sort of smartphone (BlackBerry, iPhone) for work, so a digital version of the guide would literally put the information at their fingertips. Moreover, many of the journalists saw benefit in an online website that would be compatible with their mobile devices. This is particularly valuable for reporters who often work on the road. Charles says she spends up to 70 per cent of her time outside the newsroom, so having portable and easy access to the information in the guide is “key” (Charles, personal communication, March 17, 2011). Barnsley said “smartphones are the way to go” (Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011). When questioned about the usefulness of a smartphone-compatible version of the guide he said, “It would certainly work for our company and I have a feeling it would work for other media organizations as well” (Barnsley, personal communication, April 11, 2011). The interview material suggests that journalists prefer the format that allows them to access information the quickest and with the most ease, and it seems a digital version would best support these requirements.  Despite the preference of most journalists for an online version of SABAR’s guide, many participants suggested that a hardcopy version would still be crucial. Also, SABAR’s  40 guide is intended to assist journalists in Aboriginal reporting, and given the remote locations of many Aboriginal communities, readily available Internet access must not be taken for granted. A paper version of the guide is accessible anywhere, and may prove especially beneficial depending on where exactly journalists go in their jobs. This suggests that access to the guide should not depend upon access to the Internet.  4.3.2 Interpreting the Findings This research finding provides a better understanding of how journalists would like to access SABAR’s guide in their jobs. The interview material suggests that resources that are the quickest and easiest to use are the ones preferred by most journalists, and in today’s technology-driven media environment it seems those resources are usually digital. As evidence of this claim, in 2008 The Canadian Press launched online versions of its bestselling guides, The Canadian Press Stylebook and Caps and Spelling, thereby mirroring the general transition of journalism from its traditional forms to its digital counterparts. While SABAR’s guide should also be available online, the value of a hardcopy must not be overlooked. Journalists need access to information that supports accurate Aboriginal depiction and that access should not be limited by the guide’s method of delivery.        41 Chapter  5: Conclusion The results of this study provide insight into the value of a journalism guide designed to more accurately reflect Aboriginal people and their communities. The most important finding in this study is that there is a significant need for this resource. SABAR’s terminology guide can serve accurate Aboriginal reflection by functioning as a unique and authoritative reference document for journalists. Participants indicated that they would use the guide themselves and that they also considered it a beneficial resource to keep in their newsrooms and/or distribute as part of training for new journalists. Journalists suggested that the guide would fill a void in the selection of journalism guides currently available. Moreover, it supplements a significant lack of training on the part of journalists. It is paramount to note that not one of the eleven study participants received any formal training or lessons in Aboriginal reporting at journalism school or since entering the industry. Participants saw the guide as a necessary and long overdue journalistic resource. Questions of how to ensure as many people as possible will use the guide inevitably led to discussions of ways to access the guide quickest and easiest. Participants provided suggestions for reformatting the resource but what became evident throughout the course of the interviews is that the best solution seems to be an online guide. The theoretical framework presented at the outset of this study helps make sense of the findings. Reflections of Aboriginality in the news have a long history of inaccuracies, the results of which often cast Aboriginal people in a negative light (Alia, 1999; Fleras & Kunz, 2001; Henry & Tator, 2000 & 2002; Jiwani & Young, 2006; Mahtani, 2001; Meadows, 1994). This is, of course, problematic. Journalism that does not accurately reflect the  42 diversities of Aboriginal people disavows the core values of journalistic integrity (Morgan, Pifer, & Woods, 2006). This study examines what information Canadian broadcast journalists need to report on Aboriginal issues more accurately, but some questions remain unanswered. The biggest one, perhaps, is whether a guide for Aboriginal reporting is sufficient in rectifying the ongoing misrepresentation of Aboriginality in the news. While SABAR’s terminology guide is a valuable and necessary resource, there is an obvious need for more information in journalism schools as well as the industry on the history of Aboriginal people in Canada. This was clearly demonstrated by the lack of training participants received on Aboriginal reporting in school or since entering the industry. Future research projects should explore the educational opportunities for journalists in the area of Aboriginal reporting in particular, and racialized groups in general. Another unanswered question involves determining what form the guide will eventually take. Participants demonstrated unanimous support for an online guide but many still indicated they would like to see a hardcopy version as well. Most of the media diversity strategies reviewed in this project are online resources, and this is likely an indication of where journalists routinely go for their information. Indeed, much of the industry has migrated online, so the fact that journalism resources are following is not surprising. Future studies of media diversity strategies should pay particular attention to how initiatives are accessed. An additional important area of study is determining how guides like SABAR’s get recognized as valuable reference documents. Participants said if SABAR’s guide is to serve as the industry standard for Aboriginal reporting then industry leaders like The Canadian  43 Press, government bodies, and Aboriginal organizations like the Assembly of First Nations must accept it as an authoritative source. Unfortunately, participants did not provide ways in which the guide could be recognized. Future studies should explore how media diversity strategies can gain this recognition, as the interview material suggests that acceptance by key organization (be it media, government or Aboriginal) is a critical component of producing an authoritative resource. Academic analyses in the field of media and minority relations have often relied on content analysis, focusing on the ongoing misrepresentation and underrepresentation of racialized groups through quantitative analyses of journalistic products like newspaper articles or broadcast news items. As a result, academics have not fully engaged with the producers themselves necessarily, nor have they asked how their research projects can ultimately lead to progressive social change within media institutions. This project attempted to bridge that gap, by asking what kind of research project could be designed and implemented that would best inform the development of a useful guide for journalists. The epistemological implications of this study shed light on the relationship between Aboriginal people and the media specifically, and on critical journalism more broadly.         44 References Abel, S.

My name is Jessica Michielin and I am a Masters student in my final year at the University of British Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism. I am assisting SABAR with its key terminologies guidebook project. My participation in this research study is also the basis of my thesis.  I am interested in asking journalists about the most effective way of communicating the information in SABAR’s key terminologies guidebook to those likely to use it. To this end, can you please provide me with the contact information for two potential participants within your organization? Ideally these individuals will be journalists with some experience and/or interest in covering Aboriginal stories as this research aims to explore how SABAR’s guidebook can best assist in accurately reflecting Aboriginality in the news.  I will be conducting 1-2 hour interviews. Depending on what is most convenient for each participant, interviews can be done in person or over the phone. Participants will also need to familiarize themselves with the most current draft of the guidebook beforehand.  While participating broadcasters will be gratefully acknowledged, the names of individual participants will be kept completely confidential if interviewees wish to remain anonymous.  I thank you in advance for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards, Jessica Michielin 1.778.994.8465 jmic@interchange.ubc.ca       53 Appendix B  List of Interview Questions  Semi-Structured Interview Question List  Objective: To determine how to best put SABAR's guidebook to use  What were your first impressions of the guidebook?  When would you use it?  -What would make it easier for you to use?  What changes to the current layout would make the guidebook most useful?  Besides key terminologies, what else could the guidebook include that would assist you in accurately reflecting Aboriginality in your work (ex. maps, list of First Nations, pronunciation guides, treaties and treaty information)?  What additional terms and/or websites would you recommend adding to the guidebook?  Would you consult the guidebook if it were available online?  -Which format would you prefer: hardcopy or digital?  How often should the guide be updated so you are confident that you are getting the most accurate information?  Is there anything else I haven’t asked you about the guidebook that you’d like to bring to my attention?   Objective: To gauge participants' prior experience with guidebooks like SABAR's  Have you encountered any journalism guidebooks in your career?  -How did you discover them?  -How do they compare to SABAR's?  -How often did you use them?  -How effective were they?  -Were they specific to Aboriginal peoples (vs. a multicultural scope)?  How valuable have similar guidebooks been to your work?  Can you share an example of when a similar guidebook assisted you in telling an Aboriginal story?  -Why was the guide helpful?   54 In the absence of a similar guidebook, what other resources have you consulted when telling Aboriginal stories?   Objective: To gauge range of participants' experiences in covering Aboriginal stories  What is your experience with covering Aboriginal stories?  -Have you encountered any challenges? -What were the challenges? -How did you respond? -Have you used any resources to assist you in telling Aboriginal stories?  -What were the resources? -Do you consult Aboriginal sources? -What medium(s) of journalism has/have been most effective in telling these stories? -What mediums has/have been least effective? -Have your past experiences taught you anything specific that you have since used when covering Aboriginal stories?  -What did you learn?  What do you do now in your current job?  How long have you been working as a journalist?  When you were trained as a journalist, did you ever receive any formal training or lessons in covering Aboriginal stories?\"]}}]\n"
