pepsin will digest albumen meat oct 18th c darwin', 'letterhead down beckenham kent june 24 1873 my dear dr sanderson i am going to beg a great favour of you viz to read over the enclosed brief abstract of the results of certain experiments on drosera then to answer 3 or 4 questions to consider whether you can suggest any other soluble substances which it wd be well worth my trying i do not wish to try many more as i hardly know whether these results are worth much i do know that i have not sufficient knowledge drosera is highlypeculiar by possessing absorbent glands on the leaves by shewing thro the inflection of the tentacles the influence of certain fluids it will be well to explain how the enclosed results were obtained i place half a minim of the solution on the glands at the disk of the leaf when i speak of inflection i always mean that the circumferential tentacles have become inflected tho their glands have not absorbed any of the fluid the circumferential tentacles are caused to move by the stimulus transmitted from the glands of the disk my object in the experiments here referred to has been to ascertain how far those soluble substances which produce any strongly markedeffect on animals likewise affect drosera fluids which actually corrode the tissues seem to me unimportant my queries are appended to the enclosed results are marked with red lines so as to catch your attention you will confer a great kindness on me if you will advise me ever so briefly or make any suggestions it will perhaps save you a little trouble to write any remarks on the back of my pages pray forgive me for asking this favour which i fear is somewhat unreasonable believe me yours very sincerely ch darwin i was very glad to read your article in last nature ', 'down beckenham kent railway station orpington s e r feb 10 75 my dear dr sanderson do you by any chance know whether animals can digest or decompose phosphate of potassium so as thus to obtain phosphorus i ask because the phosphates of soda lime ammonia act most powerfully on drosaea whereas phosphate of potassium is as innocent as gum or sugar i wrote some little time ago to huxley suggesting that physiologists biologists should petition the h of commons to pass a reasonable act on vivisection in the spirit of the liverpool brit assoc resolutions he said he would consult you i hope that you think well of the suggestion that something of the kind or something better will be done i feel very anxious on the subject for the sake of the grand science of physiology especiallyas an enactment advised by leading physiologists would have much moral influence on students and others pray believe me yours very sincerely charles darwin', 'down beckenham kent june 12 1874 my dear dr sanderson i have just read your article in nature it is very interesting in my opinion cd not be better done i look forward to the next number in which you will give your discovery which the more i think of seems to me the more important i hear from frank that your illustrations were capital i did not answer your last note as i had then much to do i hope after a week or so to receive an account of your digestive experiments i must add that i have found another plant pinguicola which catches flies can also digest yours very sincerely ch darwinp s i read several years ago a paper in i think report of brit assoc j i think by dr c b or dr fraser on the physiological action of various salts acids when injected with the blood of animals i think isomeric or isomorphous substances acted in nearly the same manner i remember i thought the extremely curious but i never thought that it wd concern me to use it for amusement i hear in time many acids and salts on drosera i shd much like to read the paper again ch d a card with reference wd be amply ', 'june 21 down beckenham kent my dear dr sanderson i have received am heartily obliged for the acids the fibrin 2 spec of fibrous cartilage you do not know how valuable the fibrin has proved both drosera pinguicola have quickly dissolved every atom so that i cd have fallen into a grievous error said that neither could wholly dissolve fibrin no doubt what i saw left undissolved was impurity in the wretched fibrin which i before employed thus the great and horrid anomaly is removed but then remains another if i understand rightly viz that artificial digestive fluid dissolves the fibrous basis of decalcified bone if this is so i must try drosera again as it is just possible that d would not attack the tissue until it hadremoved every atom of the phosphate and cd free animal matter the second anomaly is about gluten i prepared it myself by washing it in water till i got my finest pale brown substance but there may have been some corn starch left how i am to extricate this i know not i have just read with very great interest your 2 articles on dionaea it is most wonderful that there cd be that identity between muscle a leaf i fear that youmisunderstood me on one point the aggregation of the protoplasm does not occur until sometime after the movement has occurred but to look closer to this point has been a subject on my list for closer observation for some little time again aggregation occurs with no movement as when too strong a dose viz 2 or 3 gr of carbonate of a to 1 oz is given i do not think i expressed in my last note how very much i was pleased by your very kind encouraging notice of my work yours most sincerely ch darwinbottom of page sanderson written lightly p s may have made a small mistake has sent me vertebrate bones with no cartilage but frank has now come home knows fibro cartilage will get me some from a joint or from the butchers ', 'down beckenham kent july 25 1873 my dear dr sanderson i shd like to tell you a little about my recent work with drosera to show that i have profited by your suggestions and to ask a question or two 1 it is really beautiful how quickly well drosera dionaea dissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine i kept the same sized cubes on wet moss for comparison when you were here i forgot that i had tried gelatine but albumen is far better for watching its dissolution absorption frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for pepsine in the autumn he will discover what acid the digestive juice contains 2 a decoction of cabbage leaves green peas causes as much inflection as an infusion of raw meat a decoction of grass is less powerful though i hear that the chemists try to precipitate all albumen from the ext of belladonna i think they must fail as the ext causes inflection whereas a new lot of atropine as well as the valerinate produce no effect 3 i have been trying a good many experiments with heated water i got a new chemical therm and placed the longbulb obliquely not touching the bottoms of the with 3 oz of i moved the about a temp of from 100 to 125 fahr causes strong inflections within 10 minutes a temp from 80 to 100 causes some inflection but after a much longer time at 130 there is never any inflection but the leaf is not killed as is proved be subsequent inflection when placed in a sol of carb of ammonia by re expansion when afterwards placed in pure water the vitality of the leaves is also shown by the aggregation of the protoplasm when the leaves are give carb of amm all this holds good until the leaves are heated up to or above 145 between 145 and 151 there is a remarkable change the glandsbecome as white as porcelain there is no inflection nor aggregation of protoplasm when they are immersed in carb of amm should you not call the following case one of heat rigor two leaves were heated to 130 and had every tentacle closely inflected one was taken out and placed in cold water it re expanded the other was heated to 145 had not the least power of re expansion is not this latter case heat rigor if you can inform me i shd very much like to hear at what temp cold blooded invertebrate animals are killed 4 i must tell you my final result of which i am sure of the sensitiveness of drosaea i made a solution of 1 pt of phosphate of amm by weight to 218 750 of water of this sol i gave so much that a leaf got 1 8000th of a grain of the phosphate i then counted the glands each cd have got only 1 1 552 000 of a grain this being absorbed by the glands sufficed to cause the tentacles these glands to bend thro an angle of 180 such sensitiveness requires hot weather and carefully selected young yet mature leaves it strikes me as a wonderful fact i must add that i took every precaution by trying numerous leaves at the same time in the sol in the same water which was used for making the sol 5 if you can persuade your friend to try the effects of c of amm on the aggregation of the white blood corpuscles i shd very much like to hear the result i hope this letter will not have wearied you believe me yours very sincerely charles darwin', 'wednesday april 7 dear mr darwin i send you a

certainly a great shame that for the sake of a popular clamour supported by no facts it should be necessary to consent to an exact com ment which would make it penal to teach science in the only way that it can be taught effectively is it really too great a sacrifice to make i hope that his full enquiry which will now take placewill result in the securing of the interests both of scientific

to the brit assoc thanks for the paper which i will keep for a week or two as i find i only have the second part and now i am going to beg a favour of you which i stand in great need of viz a small quantity of a few pure animal substances namely fibrin albumin mucin or any others which are tolerably distinct perhaps you could persuade dr brunton to aide me in this of fibrin i want for a distinct and special purpose nearly a drachm but of other substances much less thefibrin must be absolutely pure of all salts for the special purpose in view i e to excite acid secretion get the acid ascertained frankland is away miller is dead and hoffman at berlin and i now know noone else to whom to apply do you know any professional chemist whom i could pay and who could be trusted to prepare such substances pure the reason of my wanting these substances is that i find absolutely pure gelatine formerly given me by hoffman does not cause drosera to be inflected though does again as far as i havegone though my experiments are not completed neither casein nor gluten from wheatflour affects drosera as meat of all kinds dead insects of all kinds and white of egg all act most energetically i

than gastric juice is required to digest certain animal substances yours very sincerely ch darwin', '49 queen anne street march 30 dear mr darwin i sent you the results of our experiments i attach much more importance to those relating to the three fatty acids than to the rest theywere very carefully made and yielded sharply defined results they shew that each of these acids possesses the power

sanderson for having sent them i had no idea that so much light had been thrown on the subject if dr bastian knew of these articles he has not written quite fairly in his recent articles i wish your essay had been longer that you had said somethingabout mr lister s observations i remember being astonished at the cool way in which dr bastian spoke of life being always destroyed at 150 degrees with organisms living in hot springs staring him in the face some little time ago mr simon sent me the last report your statements about contagion deeply interested me by the way if you see mr simon can remember it will youthank him for me i was so busy at the time that i did not write having been in correspondence with paget lately on another subject i mentioned to him an analogy which has struck me much now that we know that sheep pox is fungoid this analogy pleased him it is that of fairy rings which are believed to spread from a centre when they intersect the intersecting portion dies out as the mycelium cannot grow where it has grown during previous years so again i have never seen a ring within a ring this seems to me parallel case to a man commonly having the smallpox only once i imagine that in both cases the mycelium must consume all the matter on which it can subsist with respect to drosera i will modify the passages about globulin etc but i thought i had made it pretty clear that these substances were not pure they to a certain extent answered my purpose in showing that they were acted on in the same manner by drosera and gastric juice i did not know dr moore was dead otherwise i should have spoken more plainly i do not know anyone who could attempt to separate the ferment i suppose there would be the greatest difficulty in doing so as all my observations lead me to believe that the ferment is not secreted until some nitrogenous matter has been absorbed would not the addition of such matter make the separation extremely difficult i feel a good deal of

doubt takes place between it and common salt which is always present by virtue of which potassium chloride sodium phosphate are produced it appears to me likely that the reason why potassium phosphate does not act upon drosera is this that it is present in considerable proportion in the juices of plants consequently probably in drosera i think it would be foundthat to those salts which are present in the plant it is indifferent even though it may be excited by others which are chemically closely allied to them with reference to the subject of experiments on animals i have afterconversation with mr huxley prepared a memorandum intended to serve as the basis of a petition it is now in his hands i have lately been considering very carefully the whole question and am of course very anxious that

should be no compromise except to forbid vivisectional demonstrations to classes which i always thought both useless and cruel i have not seen mr huxley the notion of an inspector appears to me absurd it would be in the first place absurd to appoint one man to inspect half a dozen others of at least equal status with himself there is no comparison between experimentation and anatomical dissection

how carefully excellently you have made the experiments which i fear must have cost you much trouble they will be most useful to me especially those on the acids i am greatly obliged to you there in one point which you do not mention and which i ought to know viz the temperature at which the experiments were tried drosera digests at ordinary summer temperature as far as casual observations serve almost equally wellduring ordinary summer weather very hot weather if you tried your experiments at the heat of human body or above that it is just possible that the fatty acids would turn a better

put 1 4 of inch of water into the saucers of the pots the plants have been kept too cool in order toretard them you had better put them on rather warm i e temp of warm green house for a day in good light i am extremely glad you have undertaken this subject if you get a positive result i should think you ought to publish it separately i could quote it or i should be most glad to introduce any note by you into my account i have no idea whether it is troublesome to try with the thermo electric pile any change of temperature when the leaf closes i could detect none witha common thermometer but if there is any change in temperature i should expect it would occur some 8 to 12 or 24 hrs after the leaf has been given a big smashed fly when it is copiously secreting its acid digestive fluid i forgot to say that as far as i can make out the inferior surface of the leaf is always in a state of tension that the contraction is confined to the upper surface so that when this contraction

finally working up my long chapter on digestion by drosera i find that fibrin areolar tissue the fibrous basis of bone gelatin all agree in being easily dissolved by the secretion but none of them excite the leaves much incomparably less than meat albumen etc fibrocartilage behaves in the same wayexcepting that it is never thoroughly liquefied now what i want to know is whether these substances viz fibrin areolar tissue the fibrous basis of bone gelatine fibrocatilage are chemically or physiologically allied their action on animals to which they are given as food for instance is it known whether a dog would perish as soon when fed on fibrin as on gelatine i should be gratified for any scrap of informationon this lead you will see that i speak of the fibrous basis of bone is this a correct expression in almost every page of my ms i feel how much i owe to you yours very sincerely ch darwin reply on carefully considering the fact notice viz that the bodies fibrin aerolar tissue gelatin the fibrous basis of bone differ for meat albumin in test exciting on leaves of drosera that the diffc may be dependent on the that the former one used in a prepared i e washed over the as a crude i e un worked consequently heat in the latter heterogeneous stuff soluble in water water extractive is present as the former absent and in as much as the first for chemical excelator is excel material should be soluble this may explain the difference i think it probable that thoroughly worked meat would act less exciting than less worked ', '49 queen anne st wednesday ap 28 dear mr darwin

slowly over the 5 specified substances this might be accounted for by their pure state but the important fact is that they subsequently re expand so much more quickly than over minute insects meat albumen etc it is chiefly this latter fact which makes me concludethat the 5 substances are but little exciting probably not very nutritious i made so many experiments with gelatine that i can hardly doubt that this conclusion is true with this substance klein speaks handbook phys p445 as if areolar or connective tissue the fibrous basis of bone were of a gelatinous nature this made me suppose that perhaps fibrin fibro cartilage were likewise allied to gelatine as gelatineis so little nutritious to animals i imagine that the little action of these 5 substances on drosera might be thus explained my best plan would be i think never to call attention to the small power of the 5 substances on drosera and to say if you admit the truth of my inference from klein areolar tissue the fibrous basis of bone were allied to gelatine that gelatine was little nutritious to animals i fear from what you say that i may not add that fibrin fibro cartilage god knows what is the nature of

grand address on physiology at the thought that i had troubled you at such a time with my queries i quite understand what yousay about heat rigor i should think that it would be extremely interesting to ascertain whether there is any electrical change in the leaves of drosera when they are excited but i should think dionaea would be much better for the purpose as far as i can imperfectly make out the lower surface of the leaf in dionaea and of the tentacles i e tions of the leaf of drosera is always in a state of tension but is over mastered by the contraction of the upper surface alone therefore i imagine that theupper lower surface would exhibit an electrical change if such there be during the act of inflection now dionaea from the large size of the leaf and from the suddenness and greatness of the movement would be the best to operate on if on further reflection you are willing to investigate this point i would gladly send you by a servant plants in good condition for i suppose you would require to have the plants at the institute and not at down if you obtained any results it seems to me that it would be a remarkable discovery and well worth your publishing i had thought that it might be worthwhile to test dionaea during inflection by the thermo electric pile a common thermometer gave no indication of any rise of temperature so that it seems very doubtful whether the experiment would be worth trying if you find you have time and inclination to examine dionaea or drosera under the foregoing point of view please do let me hear with many thanks your very sincerely charles darwin', 'down beckenham kent may 14 1874 my dear dr sanderson i am very much obliged about the gluten what you are going to do is just what i shd have asked viz to see whether any indigestible residue is left for this always happens with gluten on drosera now that i have written out my notes by far the greatest anomaly which i found is that fibrin is never wholly dissolved watts says it is not a homogenous substance i much want you to put a bit of fibrin with an excess of pepsin and propionic or butyric acids i think the former wd be best as nearest to the acid of drosera see whether at the ordinary temp of the air the whole of the fibrin is dissolved or whether a residue is left this experiment is of the greatest importance to me as it will tend to shew whether the failure of drosera to digest the whole of the fibrin is due to the acid or nature of the ferment it is possible that the fibrin which i have used preserved in glycerine may be bad wd you therefore be so kind as to put an atom of that herewith sent into pepsin and hydro chloric a see if it is all dissolved like true fibrin if mine provesbad will you send me an atom of good fibrin i know well that i am giving you great trouble but as my notes are now written out i have come to the end of my requests so i will go on if you wd try minute cubes of albumen with pepsin and propionic or butyric acids at ordinary temp the whole ought to be dissolved if the ferment of drosera has the same power as pepsin this experiment is manifestly very important for me when you tried the globulin prepared by dr m which i sent you can you remember whether the splinters remained sharp as happens with drosera i now find that particles of this globulin left in coldwater for 3 days yields something soluble which acts energetically on drosera though the sharpest angles are not rounded by the secretions or by water i dare say it was this soluble matter which was dissolved in your experiments with globulin in pepsin and h a can you send me a bit of fibro cartilage from any animal to try on drosera i am so ignorant i might blunder i have tried cartilage lastly can you spare me a grain or two or if liquid a few drops of propionic butyric valerianic or oleic acid i find immersion in olive oil has a potent effect on drosera i suspect the fatty acids heaven forgive me for making so many requests

asking him to attend to anycreeping sensation or of heat or cold over the whole surface of the arm asking him to declare instantly as soon as he felt any such sensation mr h holland remarked to me
