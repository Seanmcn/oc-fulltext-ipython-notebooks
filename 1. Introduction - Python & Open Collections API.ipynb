Of the closely adjacent interior of\\nBritish Columbia, however, the Museum contained no specimens\\nwhatever. \\u2022\\nIn a general way it has been understood that the faunas of the\\ncoast and of the interior are markedly different, that the boundary\\nbetween the two is sharply defined, and that this boundary lies very\\nnear to the coast. It is obvious that collections could be made over a\\nrelatively limited area and still include a strip of country extending\\nfrom the one region to the other. Such an expedition would supply\\nseries of specimens of species new to the Museum collections or but\\nscantily represented therein, and would also provide valuable data\\nregarding distribution, especially with respect to the behavior of animal\\nforms at the margins of their habitats.\\nThe valley of the Stikine River seemed to satisfy all requirements.\\nIt crosses the boundary between the two f aunal areas, and, piercing the\\nformidable barrier of mountains that intervenes, affords a feasible\\nroute from one region to the other. Furthermore, we already had\\nextensive series of birds and mammals from the country about the\\nmouth of the river, to supplement whatever collections might be made\\nfarther up stream. Dr. J. A. Allen (1903) had published a report\\nupon a collection of mammals from the upper Stikine region, made\\nby A. J. Stone and M. P. Anderson, but this collection had been\\ngathered to the eastward of the debatable strip that we especially\\ndesired to explore.\\nThe expedition thus outlined was made possible through the generous provision by Miss Annie M. Alexander, founder of the Museum\\nof Vertebrate Zoology, of a sufficient sum to defray the cost, this in\\ni Previous field work on the northwest coast has been prosecuted as follows:\\nin 1906 on the Kenai Peninsula; in 1907 in the Sitkan district; in 1908 in the\\nPrince William Sound region; in 1909 in the Sitkan district; and in 1910 on\\nVancouver Island.1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        127\\naddition to her regular yearly appropriation for the maintenance of\\nthe Museum. Miss Alexander had long been especially interested in\\nthe natural history of Alaska and British Columbia and had herself\\npersonally participated in previous field work carried on in those regions by this Museum.\\nOur party consisted of two, the writer and Mr. Joseph Dixon,\\nEconomic Mammalogist of the Museum. Mr. Dixon collected most of\\nthe mammals and took entire charge of the photographic work, making this an important feature of the trip. He also supplied most of\\nthe notes regarding the nesting activities of various species of birds.\\nThe writer collected most of the birds, and worked with the mammals\\nenough to enable him to better understand local conditions. The\\nmaterial collected consists of 534 mammals, 638 birds, 24 sets of birds'\\neggs (mostly with nests), 70 amphibians, 195 photographic negatives.\\nThe present report is concerned with the mammals and birds; the\\namphibians are not included.\\nIn treating the birds I have followed the nomenclature of the\\nAmerican Ornithologists' Union Check-List (1910) and its supplements (1912, 1920), with some modifications. I have made no attempt\\nto be \\\"up to date\\\" in the adoption of the scores of changes proposed\\nof recent years, not yet acted upon by the Committee and regarding\\nwhich I have no new facts to offer or upon which I cannot form an\\nindependent opinion. There are certain cases, however, dealing mostly\\nwith matters of ornithology rather than nomenclature, where the presentation of new facts or a new point of view, or the conviction of\\nthe correctness of the course of some previous writer, 'at variance with\\nthe Check-List, impels me to the use of names not included in that\\nstandard. This, it seems to me, is proper. These changes are thus\\nformally presented for consideration, but their general adoption by\\nothers prior to action of the Committee is not expected, any more than\\nI, myself, expect at once to adopt other changes regarding. which I\\ncan have no personal knowledge. I have endeavored in every case at\\nvariance with the Check-List to indicate my reason for adopting the\\nname in question. \\\"With mammals there is no such standard, and the\\nopinion of the latest monographer of a group is usually accepted.\\nMy sincere acknowledgments are due to a number of institutions\\nand individuals for aid of one sort or another. For the prosecution\\nof the field work I was generously granted by the following authorities\\npermission to collect specimens of birds and mammals: the United\\nStates Biological Survey and the Dominion Parks Branch, Department128\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [VoL-24\\nof the Interior, Canada, for the taking of migratory birds; the United\\nStates Department of Agriculture, for game mammals in Alaska; the\\nUnited States Department of Commerce, for fur-bearing mammals in\\nAlaska; Mr. F. Kermode, Director of the Provincial Museum, Victoria British Columbia, for game and non-game birds and mammals in\\nBritish Columbia.\\nI am under obligations to the Bureau of Biological Survey of the\\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, through its chief, Dr. E. W.\\nNelson, for the loan of specimens, for the identification of certain\\nspecies, and for the determination of the contents of bird stomachs.\\nIn this connection particular mention should be made of the identification of the shrews of the genera 8 or ex and Microsorex by Dr. Hartley\\nH. T. Jackson, who examined all my material except four specimens\\nin alcohol; and of the examination of a considerable number of birds'\\nstomachs by Mr. Charles C. Sperry.\\nFrom the Victoria Memorial Museum, Ottawa, through Mr. P. A.\\nTaverner, and from the Provincial Museum, Victoria, British Columbia,\\nthrough the director, Mr. F; Kermode, I received the loan of specimens\\nof various species of birds.\\nThe plant names used in this report were supplied by Dr. F. J.\\nSmiley, of the University of California Herbarium, based upon specimens collected on this expedition that have been deposited in the\\nHerbarium.\\nAdvice and information was received from Mr. Ernest P. Walker,\\nan employee of the United States Bureau of Fisheries who was stationed at Wrangell, Alaska, at the time we were pursuing our field\\nwork in that region. Mr. \\\"Walker supplied data on certain species\\nfrom the vicinity of \\\"Wrangell, and he has presented to the Museum\\nof Vertebrate Zoology specimens of birds and mammals from the same\\nregion that are desirable additions to the Museum collection.\\nI take pleasure in expressing my gratitude to Mr. \\\"W.

There we made arrangements with the Barrington Transportation Company whereby their\\nriver boat, running on fairly regular schedule, deposited us at various\\nselected camp sites. Our collecting stations were carefully chosen,\\nboth with regard to their location on the river, and to the accessibility\\nof stretches of surrounding territory. The last item is of importance\\nin a wilderness as generally impenetrable as are the forests of the\\nlower Stikine.\\nOur itinerary, in detail, was as follows: left Berkeley, May 14;\\nleft Wrangell, Alaska, May 21; arrived Telegraph Creek, B. C, May\\n23; The Junction, May 25 to June 6; Telegraph Creek, June 6 to 26;\\nGlenora, June 27 to July 8; Doch-da-on Creek, July 8 to 26; Flood\\nGlacier, July 26 to August 8; Great Glacier, August 8 to 16; Sergief\\nIsland, August 17 to September 7; Mitkof Island, August 26 to 29;\\narrived Berkeley, September 15.\\nTELEGRAPH CREEK\\nThe town of Telegraph Creek is on the north bank of the Stikine\\nRiver, about 130 miles from, and 540 feet above, tidewater (Brooks,\\n1906, p. 49). It is about 160 miles from the general line of the coast\\nat the mouth of the river, following the course of the stream; less\\nthan half that distance in an air line from the nearest point on the\\ncoast. Telegraph Creek, the stream, flowing from the north, empties\\ninto the river at this point. Near the town the river banks rise steeply\\non either side to a series of terraces beyond. At many points these\\nenclosing walls are sheer cliffs of basaltic rock, several hundred feet\\nhigh, with long steep taluses extending below, sometimes to the river's\\nedge. Telegraph Creek, for the last mile or two of its course, flows\\nalong a narrow canon, the steep walls rising abruptly to the level\\nterraces above. In its upper reaches it follows a canon the walls of\\nwhich are not particularly steep. The stream has its source in a\\nstring of lakes at \\\"the Summit,\\\" some twelve miles north of the point\\nwhere it empties into the Stikine, at an altitude of about 2600 feet.\\nThe mountains rise to a much greater height on either side. About\\ntwo miles northwest of the town of Telegraph Creek is Sawmill Lake,\\nabout a mile long. Four or five miles farther west lies the much larger\\nAlkali Lake.1922]        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Regioi\\n131\\nIn the Telegraph Creek region the principal feature of the vegetation is the poplar woods.

This strip has some timber upon it, cottonwood, spruce, alder,\\nand willow, but is mostly grown with tall grass and pea vines. The\\nriver flows close to the island. There are no mud flats on the east\\nside, but extensive sand bars are exposed at low tide. The rocky\\nbackbone of the. island rises abruptly from the surrounding marsh,\\nand is covered with the dense forest growth characteristic of the\\nSitkan district. Spruce is predominant in the woods, with tangled\\nundergrowth beneath, in which devil's-elub is most prominent. At the\\nedge of the woods is a fringe of alder, these bushes diminishing in size\\nand density as salt water is approached. At the upper edge of the\\ntidal flats the alders give way to scrubby willows, which extend far\\nout on the marshes, over much of the ground that is not regularly\\ninundated by the tides.

Its headwaters interlock with those of the Liard and with streams that flow into\\nthe Yukon. Thus, the height of land that traverses northern British\\nColumbia serves as a divide between several great river systems. The\\nLiard flows northeastward through the Rocky Mountains to the\\nMackenzie, which flows into the Arctic Ocean; the Yukon flows north-\\nM\\\"\\nIlls142\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [VoL-24\\nwestward to Bering Sea; on the west, the Taku, Stikine, and Skeena\\nrivers follow parallel courses westward through the Coast Range to\\nthe Pacific. Headwaters of all these streams rise from nearby points\\nin northern British Columbia.\\nFor some distance from its source the Stikine flows from east to\\nwest, following fairly closely the 58th parallel of.latitude, and receiving from time to time tributaries of considerable size. In the Telegraph Creek region the river gradually turns, first toward the southwest, then almost due south. Some twenty miles from the coast, about\\nat the British Columbia-Alaska boundary, it bends sharply to the\\nwestward once more, and reaches salt water near the town of \\\"Wrangell,\\namid the network of islands forming the Alexander Archipelago.\\nA tributary of importance to the upper Stikine is Clearwater\\nCreek, entering from the northwest some thirty miles below Telegraph\\nCreek. Near the Boundary there is a small stream that is locally\\ncalled j' Clearwater Creek,'' and there is apt to be confusion between\\nthe two if the facts are not known.\\nOur work did not take us above the middle Stikine Valley, with its\\nuppermost limit at Telegraph Creek. In this section, from Telegraph\\nCreek down stream nearly to Doch-da-on Creek, the valley is rather\\nbroad, the mountains rising at a distance on either side. Just south\\nof Doch-da-on Creek the Stikine begins its passage through the Coast\\nRange. The valley, already much narrowed, becomes still more constricted ; some five miles below Doch-da-on Creek the river is hemmed\\nin between the rocky walls of Kloochman Canon, the uppermost of the\\ntwo narrow gorges through which the Stikine passes in the lower part\\nof its course. The mountains from this point on become much higher\\nand more precipitous. From Doch-da-on Creek looking northward and\\neastward the valley is broad in extent and the mountains are relatively\\nlow and rounded. Many of the summits are bare of snow during the\\nsummer months. To the southward and westward a jumbled mass of\\njagged peaks and ridges arises, forbidding in the extreme, and pressing\\nclosely in upon either side of the river.\\n\\\"Where the Stikine passes through the mountains, the river valley\\nis exceedingly rough and covered with a forest that is virtually impenetrable.   In this connection it is of interest to quote some statements of Emmons (1911, pp. 9-10) in his description of the country,\\nof the Tahltan Indians, who occupy the region of the upper Stikine.\\nThe lower valley of the Stikine from just below Glenora to the coast, a direct\\ndistance of about eighty miles, is included within the coastal range and constitutes a region of great humidity, with leaden skies and an annual precipitationIf\\n19221 Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        143\\nequalling if not exceeding that of the coast which reaches a mean of eighty-six\\ninches.

Surrounding these centers there are\\nmiles of meadow, marsh land, and mud flats, resulting from the deposition of silt by the river. During the period of high water in midsummer the stream is gray and opaque with silt carried in suspension,\\nand this silt has been dropped in the channels immediately beyond the\\nriver's mouth until they are well-nigh filled.\\nA conspicuous forest tree of the lower Stikine is the cottonwood.\\nThis tree covers all the low ground near the water, grows densely and\\nto a large size. It finds a foothold on sand bars and aids in the building\\nup of such areas into more stable bottom land. Consequently, there\\nare hundreds of acres of cottonwood in almost pure stands but slightly\\nabove the level of the *river or even submerged at the highest water.\\nEast of the Coast Range, cottonwood is much less conspicuous than\\nalong the lower river, though still persisting in considerable numbers.\\nIn the country in general at the mouth of the Stikine, the Sitka\\nspruce is the dominant tree. This tree, with other associated conifers,\\nextends some distance up stream, forming an evergreen forest that\\ncovers all but the unstable bottom land where the quick-growing\\ncottonwoods occur. Where rocky slopes rise abruptly from the river's\\nbank, the conifers range down to the water's edge. The higher ground\\nback from the first bottom is covered densely with woods Of spruce\\nand hemlock, and with undergrowth of devil's-club, alder, and huckleberry. Such woods extend with but slight breaks to a point a little\\nabove the Little Canon. Farther inland the spruce woods ascend higher\\nand higher on the mountain sides, until at Doch-da-on Creek the lower\\nlimit of this belt lies at an altitude of about 2000 feet. Somewhere\\nbelow Doch-da-on Creek the Sitka spruce of the coast gives way to\\nother conifers of the interior, but just where this happens we did not\\nascertain. On the upper Stikine, poplar becomes the dominant growth\\nof the valley, mixed, here and there, with groves of conifers or of\\ncottonwood.\\n! j144\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [Vol.24\\nThe Sitkan district of southeastern Alaska is characterized by\\nexcessive humidity and by relatively equable temperature. The annual\\nrainfall at many points is 100 inches or more, the number of rainy\\ndays per year around 200. There is a great deal of foggy and cloudy\\nweather. The winters are not extremely cold nor are the summers\\nvery warm. The vegetation of this region is comprised mostly of an\\nextremely dense growth of coniferous forest trees, and, beneath the\\ntrees, underbrush almost tropical in its luxuriance. The Sitkan district is here considered as including the islands between Cross Sound\\nand Dixon Entrance, together' with a narrow strip of the adjacent\\nmainland coast. Its eastward limits are sharply defined by the towering and precipitous range of mountains that, rising abruptly from\\nthe shore, parallels the coast. To the eastward of this Coast Range, in\\nthe interior of British Columbia and Alaska, is a region of widely\\ndifferent character. I have not exact meteorologic data for this section,\\nbut certain general facts are obvious. Dawson (1889, pp. 58&-59o)\\nremarks on this subject as follows:\\nIt may be stated here, as showing the broad general contrast, that while the\\nannual precipitation at Wrangell, at the mouth of the Stikine, is over sixty inches,\\nthat in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek on the inland side of the mountains, is so\\nsmall that it is necessary to irrigate. cultivated land. Nor does this comparison\\nof rain-fall suflieiently mark the great diversity which actually obtains between\\nthe two climates, the prevalence of clouded skies in the coast region being accompanied by a saturated state of the atmosphere, while precisely opposite conditions\\nare found on the eastern side of the mountain belt, at not more than eighty miles\\ninland from the general line of the coast.\\nThe country east of the mountains is subject to far greater extremes\\nof temperature than the coast region, with hot summers and with extremely cold winters. The forest covering includes a considerable proportion of conifers, but there is also a still larger proportion of deciduous timber. The animal life in these two regions, the Sitkan\\ndistrict of the coast and the adjacent interior, is widely different.\\nThe vailey of the Stikine forms a highway between the two faunal\\nareas, otherwise separated by physical barriers and sharply contrasted\\nin nearly all particulars, though lying in close juxtaposition. The\\npresence of this channel of communication affords excellent opportunity for observation of the geographic behavior of the many animal\\nspecies that by this means are permitted an outlet in either direction.\\nCertain contrasted species and subspecies occupying comparable positions in each of the two faunal areas are brought together, and thus\\ninto competition; others with no such direct rival in the adjacent area\\nare brought into contact with climatic conditions, adverse in that they\\nare unaccustomed.19\\u00a3\\n5] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n145\\nThe Stikine is one of several large rivers of the northwest that\\nbreak through the Coast Range at right angles to the lines of those\\nmountains, their valleys thus lying transverse to the main lines of the\\nrange. In a published report upon the geology of Alaska, A. H.\\nBrooks (1906) makes the following statement regarding the Copper,\\nAlsek, Taku, and Stikine rivers: \\\"These, together with the other\\nlarge rivers of British Columbia, seem to traverse the coastal mountain barrier along valleys determined by antecedent conditions. Their\\nlower valleys at least have the same direction as before the present\\ncoastal mountains were elevated, and the streams -maintained their\\ncourses across the barrier during the slow uplift\\\" (p. 286). Again:\\n\\\"The valleys of the Stikine and Taku rivers, .... which lie transverse to the Coast Range, have probably inherited their courses from\\na former mature drainage system which was developed on the old\\npeneplain\\\" (loc. cit., p. 287).\\nIn this connection it is worth while to note the appearance of the\\nriver valley of the upper Stikine in the Telegraph Creek region. There,\\nand for many miles down stream from that point, the stream is bordered by series of terraces, rising step by step to the base of the mountains beyond. Viewed from some overlooking height the course of any\\none of these terraces may be traced for a long distance. It seems\\nobvious that they represent the level of the river valley at different\\nperiods of its history.    (See fig. B.)\\nThe evidence of the geologist goes to show that, diverse as the coast\\nregion and the interior are, as regards fauna and flora, the two have\\nnot been absolutely separated by the Coast Range at all times in the\\npast any more than they are at present. A channel of communication\\nthrough the mountains has been there continuously from very remote\\ngeologic times, save for a period when it must have been blocked by ice.\\nPresumably all animal life was swept from both regions when the\\nwhole country was glacier-covered. Presumably, too, conditions in the\\nareas on either side of the Coast Range permitted the return of animals\\nand plants from the southward when the mountains between were still\\nmostly ice. Even now the range is glacier-covered over a large portion\\nof its area. The higher peaks and ridges protrude, steep and serrated,\\nfar above the ice. From the jagged, unworn appearance of these\\nhigher crests they apparently never were covered. The sheet of ice\\nas seen today lies below the summit of the range, and can be traced\\nas a series of hanging glaciers appearing and re-appearing for many\\nmiles at about the same level, visible from the river below. In certain\\ncanons and valleys, tongues of this glacial covering extend downward\\nI146\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [VoL-24\\n1 i\\nShB\\nfar below the general level, some of them to within a mile or two of\\nthe river. It' cannot be such a very long period of time since ice\\nblocked the entire valley. In fact, there are today legends among the\\nTahltan Indians of a time when an ice bridge still extended across\\nthe Stikine at the Great Glacier, connecting ice masses that are now\\nperhaps four or five miles apart. Of course, as remarked by Dawson\\n(1889, p. 53fe) about this same tale, it is impossible to determine\\nwhether \\\"this is a remembered fact or a fancied inference.\\\" (In this\\nconnection see also Emmons, 1911, p. 15.)\\nThe hypothesis of a glacial blockade of communication between\\nthe interior and the coast would imply the separate derivation of the\\nanimal life of each. That is, that there was invasion from the southward on either side of the coast range, of the same or of different\\nspecies, as the case might be. Doubtless, at a still later period, there\\nwas invasion of certain species from the northward as well. Among\\nbirds in particular detailed comparisons may be made (see fig P),\\nand upon comparing the avifauna of the interior and of the coast in\\nthe Stikine region, it will be seen that not only are comparable ecologic\\nniches on either side of the mountains usually filled by different species\\nrather than subspecies, but that frequently the species are not especially closely related. Furthermore, among the few cases where two\\nsubspecies of a species do occur abundantly on either side of the mountains, there is hardly an instance where we were able to trace inter-\\ngradation along the connecting valley of the Stikine. In some few\\ncases where the birds were abundant enough for us to ascertain the\\nfaet, it was evident that certain subspecies, at this particular point,\\nmet as distinct species. All this argues for invasion from the southward, on either side of the Coast Range, of bird species and subspecies\\nthat met at a much later period along such channels as the Stikine\\nValley.\\nThe intrusion of a range of high mountains was productive of\\ndiverse climatic conditions in the two regions. This, in turn, resulted\\nin differences in the reestablished plant and animal life to a far greater\\nextent than would follow from the mere presence of a physical barrier\\nsuch as a mountain mass. Differences of temperature and of humidity\\narose, so that at the present time the two areas, east and west of the\\nCoast Range, respectively, form strongly contrasted faunal areas (dependent upon relative humidity), and they are somewhat different\\nzonally (dependent upon temperatures).\\nAt a considerably later period than that at which the regions on\\neither side of the mountains became habitable, conditions in certain19221 Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        147\\nof the river valleys traversing the barrier (as the Stikine) became\\nsuch as to permit the existence of animal and plant life, and various\\nspecies extended their ranges up or down such channels of communication, as circumstances permitted. One factor that may be of present\\nimportance in limiting the use of the Stikine Valley as such a channel,\\nso far as birds are concerned, is the late advent of summer conditions\\non the lower Stikine compared with the regions on either side, a\\nseasonal tardiness that unquestionably prevents the nesting of many\\nspecies in this intermediate strip at the time of their arrival from the\\nsouth. (In this connection see Dawson, 1889, p. 596; Emmons, 1911,\\npp. 9-10.)\\nThe general hypothesis outlined seems to accord with conditions\\nas we now see them. Among birds it may be pointed out that it is\\nconsistent with the manner of occurrence of forms like Hylocichla\\nustulata ustulata and H. u. swainsoni, closely related subspecies of one\\nspecies but behaving at this point like two distinct species. It is consistent with the extension inland a certain distance of forms like\\nSphyrapicus varius ruber and Passerella iliaca fuliginosa, and toward\\nthe coast of Piranga ludoviciana (see Swarth, 1911, p. 95) and Empi-\\ndonax trailli alnorum, and it is consistent with the restriction on one\\nside or the other of such distinct and sharply delimited forms as\\nBombycilla garrula pallidiceps and Cyanocitta stelleri stelleri.\\nIn this connection, certain facts regarding the present-day migration of birds in the region should be considered. If there were any\\ngeneral travel between the interior and the coast such river valleys\\nas the Stikine would be the highways most generally followed. Our\\nwork in the region shows pretty clearly that such is not the case. It\\nseems evident that the birds of the interior travel north and south\\nalmost entirely east of the coast ranges. Some of them, it is well\\nknown, even pass east of the Rocky Mountains as they get farther\\nsouth.   Birds of the coastal region remain west of the mountains.\\nWe found many characteristic inland species of birds, some breeding, others, perhaps, merely migrants, as far down stream as Great\\nGlacier, some thirty miles from the coast. The species seen there\\ninclude Penthestes atricapillus septentrionaMs, Setophaga ruticilla,\\nHylocichla ustulata swainsoni, and Vireosylva gilva swainsoni, none\\nof which has been taken on the coast. Dendroica aestiva was an abundant migrant, though almost entirely absent at the mouth of the\\nriver. The Stikine in its passage through the Coast Range travels\\nalmost due south, and it is natural that birds from the headwaters\\nshould migrate in numbers along this valley.   It is not so clear why148\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [Vo,L-24\\n111\\n1 \\u2022 m \\u25a0\\nthey should not arrive at the mouth. However, a short distance below\\nthe Great Glacier, about at the boundary, the stream turns sharply\\nto the westward. Just above this bend is the mouth of the Iskut, a\\ntributary of the Stikine that is nearly as large as the main stream. At\\nthe point of junction the broad valley of the Iskut enters from the\\nsoutheast and its course is east and west for some distance. A perfectly feasible outlet is thus afforded for migrating birds from the\\nnorthward at just the point where the Stikine Valley would lead\\nthem astray. I do not know that this is the course that is actually\\nfollowed, but it may very well be, and if so it serves to explain the\\nabsence at the mouth of the river of species that were migrating southward in numbers at a point some thirty miles up stream.\\nThere are, however, certain inland species that appear to migrate\\nregularly coastward, though doubtless in lesser numbers than go\\ndirectly south. Dendroica coronata hooveri has been taken in the fall\\nnear the mouth of the Taku River (Swarth, 1911, p. 99), and we\\nobtained it at the mouth of the Stikine, each time in sufficient numbers\\nto appear to be of regular occurrence. Sialia currucoides has been found\\nnear the mouth of the Taku under similar circumstances (Swarth,\\nloc cit., p. 112), and while we, ourselves, did not meet with, this species\\nat the mouth of the Stikine, specimens have been taken there.\\nThe question arises as to the migration of such species as Melospiza\\nmelodia rufina and Passerella iliaca fuliginosa, coastal forms primarily\\nbut breeding far inland up the Stikine. \\\"Whether or not they ascend\\nand descend the river in their travels is not clear, and the facts will\\nbe difficult to ascertain.\\nThe casual occurrence at the mouth of the Stikine in the spring of\\nsuch species as Myadestes townsendi and Sialia currucoides (see pp.\\n301, 309) is noteworthy. Such wanderers in the fall might be explained as individuals that had mistakenly followed the river to its\\nmouth. In the spring, they can not be regarded as having gone\\nastray. The fact that they had reached this point is evidence that they\\nwere confidently traveling to a definite goal, though along a path not\\nusually followed by their kind.\\nAt high water, quantities of drift are carried down the river. It\\nis probable that small mammals living in the bottom lands often take\\nrefuge in fallen trees or in masses of brush that are suddenly floated\\naway, and are thus transported far down the river. This may be one\\nfactor tending toward the more general extension coastward of inland\\nspecies as compared with the sharper restriction of coastal forms (see\\n%\\u2022 Q).1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n14\\u00a3\\nThus there are certain species of birds and mammals for which\\nthe valley of the Stikine River acts as a channel of communication\\nbetween interior and coast. There are none to which it acts in the\\nopposite role, as a barrier to farther distribution, north or south. It\\nwould not to birds, of course, in any event. As regards mammals,\\nconditions here are very different from what, for example, they are in\\nthe valley of a stream like the Colorado River, of the southwestern\\nUnited States. In that region, not only the river itself but also the\\nwide strips of^adjacent bottom lands absolutely prevent the passage of\\ncertain desert mammals, so that there are a number of species and\\nsubspecies restricted to one side or the other (ef. Grinnell, 1914).\\nIn the Stikine Valley no local conditions (\\\"associations\\\") exist\\nthat tend to keep certain groups of animals either close to or far distant from the river banks, and the same forms range unhindered from\\nthe water's edge well up the mountain sides. For a period of months\\nthe river is frozen over quite to its mouth, and there is no doubt that\\nat that season individuals of many species of mammals cross from one\\nside to the other.\\n1\\nZONAL AND FAUNAL POSITION OF THE STIKINE VALLEY\\nThe Sitkan district of southeastern Alaska has been generally\\nconsidered to be mostly of the Canadian life zone. The areas that\\nextend above timber on the higher mountains afford a strip of Alpine\\nArctic of considerable extent, and a drawback to the recognition of\\nthe lower altitudes as Canadian is the absence of any well defined\\nintervening strip of Hudsonian. Some birds and mammals that occur\\nelsewhere in the Canadian zone do occur in the lowlands of the Sitkan\\ndistrict, but on the other hand species generally regarded as indicative\\nof the Hudsonian zone are found throughout the whole region. Altogether it seems as though all the Sitkan district below Alpine-Arctic\\nshould be considered as of the Hudsonian zone, with a strong infusion\\nof Canadian in the southern part at least. Certainly this coastal strip\\nis of a higher life zone than the adjacent interior.\\nIn the country immediately east of the Coast Range there has not\\nbeen sufficient work to permit detailed mapping of the life zones. The\\nmost recent zonal map covering that section is the one published in\\nthe A. 0. U. Check-List (1910, pi. 1) and is on too small a scale to\\npermit of much detail. On that map the Hudsonian zone covers\\npractically all of northern British Columbia, extending considerably\\nfarther southward there than in southern Alaska, to the westward, or\\nI;Mi\\n150\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [Vol. 2*\\n111   I\\n$i\\nin northern Alberta, to the eastward. The adjacent coastal strip of\\nsoutheastern Alaska is indicated as Canadian, and there are narrow,\\nstrips of Canadian extending inland along certain river valleys, of\\nwhich the Stikine is one. The interior is thus regarded as of a higher\\nzone than the coast. This is not in accordance with our own findings.\\nOne of the rules upon which life zones are based is as follows \\u2022 '' The\\nnorthward distribution of terrestrial animals and plants is governed\\nby the sum of the positive temperatures for the entire season of growth\\nand reproduction\\\" (Merriam, 1898, p. 54). Exact figures are lacking\\nfor the region we visited, but there can be no doubt that the summer\\ntemperature of the country immediately east of the mountains is\\nappreciably higher than on the coast. In further illustration of the\\nrelative zonal positions of the two regions, the following lists of some\\ncharacteristic summer birds of the lowlands should be considered.\\nCOAST\\nDendragapus obscurus sitkensis\\nOyanoeitta stelleri stelleri\\nNannus hiemalis pacifieus\\nRegulus satrapa olivaeeus\\nRegulus calendula grinnelli\\nIxoreus naevius naevius\\nINTERIOR\\nBonasa umbellus umbelloides\\nButeo swainsoni\\nNuttallornis borealis\\nSpizella passerina passerina\\nVireosylva gilva swainsoni\\nSetophaga rutieilla\\nFurthermore, in the course of our work the interesting fact was\\ndeveloped that certain species of birds that occur commonly at sea\\nlevel on the coast occur inland at constantly increasing elevations.\\nAscending the Stikine it is noticeable, at a point about a hundred miles\\ninland, that the characteristic spruce forest found at sea level on the\\ncoast and on the banks along the lower reaches of the river, here begins\\nto ascend the mountain sides, its place in the valley being taken by the\\npoplar woods. In the Telegraph Creek region we found the spruce\\nbelt at an altitude of perhaps 1500 to 2000 feet, and found therein the'\\nbird species to which reference is made. It is an additional complication that whereas certain subspecies extend unchanged from the coast\\nto the interior as inhabitants of this spruce belt, some species are represented by different subspecies at the two extremes. Nannus hiemalis\\npacifieus and Regulus satrapa olivaeeus belong in the first mentioned\\ncategory. In the second, Dendragapus obscurus sitkensis, Regulus\\ncalendula grinnelli, and Ixoreus naevius naevius, of the coast, appear\\nto be replaced in the interior by Dendragapus obscurus flemingi,\\nRegulus calendula calendula, and Ixoreus naevius meruloides. Among\\nmammals, Marmota caligata is one conspicuous species that occurs at\\nsea level on the coast (M. c. caUgata) and at high elevations inland\\n(M. c. oxytona).   It is a matter for regret that we were unable to give1922]        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n151\\nmore study than we did to the fauna of the spruce belt of the interior\\nmountains, for our data are admittedly scanty; but at any rate it is\\nevident that the bird population, at least, of that region contains a\\nlarge proportion of forms that are characteristic of lower levels at the\\ncoast. The presence of the several animal and plant species noted\\nserves for the recognition of a strip of Hudsonian zone on the mountain\\nFig. N Fig. O\\nFig. N.

They are as follows: Canachites canadensis osgoodi is\\nbelieved to be mainly a bird of the spruce belt on the mountains.152\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol. 24\\nin\\nmm\\nIf\\nWW\\nPerisoreus canadensis canadensis was quite through nesting when we\\nreached the region, but presumably does not breed in the valley near\\nthe river. Pinicola e. fiammula appeared to belong to the spruce belt,\\nbut this is doubtful. Zonotrichia coronata is in this latitude unquestionably a high mountain species, reaching its greatest abundance in\\nthe scrubby balsam at timber line. The unsettled question concerns\\nits extension coastward. In the coast region it does not occur in the\\nlowlands, but may occur on the mountains. Spizella monticola\\nochracea is a high mountain bird in the Telegraph Creek region,\\nprobably near the southern limit of the bird's distribution.\\nWe ourselves did not get far back from the Stikine Valley at any\\npoint, and it might be argued that our finding there of certain species\\nnot extending into the Hudsonian is no more than corroborative of the\\nnarrow line of Canadian extending along the Stikine Valley, shown\\nin the zone map cited. However, recent work has been done in the\\ninterior at Hazelton and at Atlin, which shows the general distribution\\nof the bird species to which reference is made; on this basis it seems\\naltogether likely that northern British Columbia should be regarded\\nas predominantly of the Canadian life zone rather than of the Hudsonian.\\nIt seems worth while to make such comparisons as are possible of\\nthe results- attained by the other ornithological work recently done in\\nnorthern British Columbia. Taverner (1919) has reported upon a\\ncollection of birds from Hazelton, and E. M. Anderson (1915a) upon\\na collection from Atlin. The three points, Atlin, Telegraph Creek, and\\nHazelton, are about the same distance inland. Atlin is about 150\\nmiles north of Telegraph Creek, near the head of the Taku drainage,\\nHazelton about 225 to the southward, on the upper Skeena.

A large percentage of the mammals of the interior are of species\\nof which it is difficult to obtain specimens, especially in summer. A\\nnumber of species we failed to meet with at all, though possibly they\\nI\\ni\\nI154 University of California Publications in Zoology      [VoL-24\\n':.\\u25a0'\\noccur in fair abundance, and of others but an unsatisfactory representation was obtained.\\nAs faunal areas, the Sitkan district and the country east of the\\nmountains are strongly contrasted. Differences of humidity are as\\nstriking as those of temperature, and these differences are reflected in\\nthe mammal, bird, and plant life of the two regions. The peculiarities\\nof the Sitkan district are well known, and the accepted boundaries well\\ndefined. Of the country east of the mountains, as typified in the\\n. Telegraph Creek region, the peculiarities are equally well marked.\\nThis district, of undetermined extent, save where it impinges upon the\\nSitkan district, appears worthy of a name as a recognizable faunal\\narea, for the sake of convenient reference, at least, and I would suggest the adoption of Cassiar district, a name applied to it as a political\\ndivision.\\nThe birds of the two regions are more widely different than are the\\nmammals, that is, there are more distinct types in each region. The\\ntwo mammal faunas are distinct enough, and there are certain conspicuous species in each district that are not found in the other, but\\nin many cases closely related species or subspecies replace one another\\non either side of the dividing line. Certain species of which a large\\nrepresentation was obtained (Peromyscus and Microtus) exhibit inter-\\ngradation between related forms along the river to an extent far beyond anything found among the birds.\\nThe two accompanying tables (figs. P, Q) serve to show the relationships of the bird and mammal faunas of the two regions, and the\\nnature of the occurrence of the various species in the Stikine Valley,\\nas observed by us. Certain generalizations may be drawn from these\\ntables. (1) There are, as previously remarked, more distinct types of\\nbirds in the two contrasted regions than there are of mammals. (2)\\nThere are more bird forms in the interior than on the coast. (In\\naddition, it may be said that bird life, as regards number of individuals, is far more abundant in the interior than on the coast.) (3)\\nIn the Stikine Valley, at least, there are a number of species of the\\ninterior that extend far toward the coast, while very few coastal races\\nextend any distance inland; the fauna of the Sitkan district is closely\\nconfined to the region west of the Coast Range. In certain respects\\nthese tables are imperfect. It would take many seasons of field work\\nto fill in gaps in our knowledge that are here apparent. Also, in the\\ncase of some species there are differences of altitude concerned (implying zonal differences) as well as those of linear distance, and such\\ndistinctions could not be made in this table.Miles from coast\\n0      40       70      110     145    160\\nhumid coast\\narid interior\\nDendragapus o. sitkensis1\\nDendragapus o. flemingi\\nFalco s. sparverius\\nCryptoglaux f. richardsoni\\nDryobates v. montieola\\nSphyrapicus v. varius\\nColaptes a. borealis\\nChordeiles v. virginianus\\nSayornis sayus\\nNuttallornis borealis\\nMyiochanes r. richardsoni\\nEmpidonax t. alnorum\\nEmpidonax hammondi\\nEmpidonax wrighti\\nDryobates v. sitkensis1\\nSphyrapicus v. ruber\\nColaptes c. cafer1\\n\\\\\\t\\n\\u2022*\\t\\nEmpidonax d. difficilis\\n>\\n\\u20224\\t\\nCyanocitta s. stelleri\\n >\\nCorvus b. caurinus\\nEuphagus carolinus\\nCarpodacus p. purpureus\\nLoxia c. bendirei\\nLoxia c. sitkensis\\nPasserculus s. savanna\\n,\\n< \\u25a0\\u25a0\\n<     \\u25a0\\nZonotrichia 1. gambeli\\n<\\u2014\\\" \\u25a0\\u25a0\\nSpizella m. ochracea\\nSpizella p. passerina\\nJunco h. connectens\\nJunco o. oreganus\\nMelospiza m. rufina\\nMelospiza 1. gracilis\\nPasserella i. fuliginosa\\nPiranga ludoviciana\\nPetrochelidon 1. lunifrons\\nTachycineta t. lepida\\nRiparia riparia\\nBombycilla g. pallidiceps\\nVireosylva g. swainsoni\\nVermivora c. orestera\\n\\u25a0<\\t\\n\\t\\nVermivora c. lutescens\\nDendroica a. rubiginosa1\\ni\\n<\\t\\nVermivora peregrina\\nDendroica a. aestiva\\nDendroica c. hooveri\\n|\\nDendroica townsendi\\nWilsonia p. pileolata\\nNannus h. pacifieus\\nCerthia f. occidentalis\\nPenthestes a. septen-\\nPenthestes r. rufescens\\nPenthestes g. abbreviatus\\nRegulus c. calendula _\\nMyadestes townsendi\\nHylocichla u. swainsoni\\nHylocichla g. guttata\\nPlanesticus m. migratorius\\nIxoreus n. meruloides\\nSialia currucoides\\nRegulus c. grinnelli\\nHylocichla u. ustulata1\\nHylocichla g. nanus\\nPlanesticus m. caurinus\\nIxoreus n. naevius\\n *\\u25a0\\n?\\n|\\n1Known to occur on the coast of southeastern Alaska, but not encountered on the lower Stikine\\nby this expedition.\\nFig. P.

Water Shrew\\nAn adult male (no. 30568) was trapped near Telegraph Creek on\\nJune 22, in a bit of swampy land near the stream. Allen (1903, p. 567)\\nhas referred the water shrew of this region to Neosorex pahistris alas-\\nkanus (Merriam), but our one specimen does not exhibit the characters\\nascribed to that race (cf.

As compared with\\nCalifornian examples of navigator, the Telegraph Creek specimen is\\nexactly similar in general size and in skull characters, but is of slightly\\nmore grayish coloration.\\nI have seen one specimen of Neosorex from the coast of southeastern Alaska (in the collection of E. P. Walker), taken at Rudyard\\nBay, about one hundred miles south of the Stikine River, and this\\nanimal does exhibit the cranial peculiarities ascribed to alaskanus. It\\nseems likely that the latter is confined to the coastal region.1922]        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n159\\nMicrosorex eximius (Osgood).   Osgood Shrew\\nA single Microsorex (no. 30560) was trapped at the east end of\\nSawmill Lake, near Telegraph Creek, on June 16.

Grizzly Bear\\nGrizzlies are still numerous in the Stikine region. We ourselves\\nsaw fresh sign at many points, though no animal was encountered.\\nThe most obvious indication of their presence was, of course, footprints,\\nbut other evidence was frequently found, such as rotten logs ripped\\nto pieces by the bears for the insect food they contained. At Doch-\\nda-on Creek an unoccupied cabin in the woods was entered by a bear\\nseveral times during the two weeks we spent at that place, and more\\nor less damage done. At this point we saw grizzly tracks in the snow\\nat timber line, about 4000 feet altitude.\\nAt Hyland 's store, Telegraph Creek, we examined ten grizzly skins,\\nkilled the previous fall, all from about the same place, on the Klappan\\nRiver (a tributary of the Stikine) about 100 miles east of Telegraph\\nCreek. Of these we purchased a skin with the skull of an old male\\n(no. 31015) and a skin alone of a smaller animal, apparently a female\\n(no. 31016). These specimens, both skins and skull, answer fairly\\nwell to the description of Ursus stikeenensis given by Merriam (1914,\\np. 178; 1918, p. 88).\\nThere are no less than seven species of big bears accredited to this\\ngeneral region by Merriam (1918). Whether or not I have ascribed\\nour specimens to the correct form, I think there is no doubt that all the\\nskins in the above mentioned series belonged to one species, for there\\nwas really remarkable uniformity in color and markings in the lot.\\nSubsequently the skin of another bear was examined, a huge male\\nkilled on Clearwater Creek, and it again was of exactly the same type.\\nThe noticeable color features are the general dark coloration, the yel1\\nlowish or grayish grizzling on the shoulders and along the back, and\\nthe black feet, legs, and lower parts. The tanned skin of the male\\nspecimen, an animal that, from the appearance of the skull was evidently past maturity, measures from tip of nose to base of tail approximately 1680 millimeters; the one from Clearwater Creek, above mentioned, was very much larger. The claws are short for a grizzly, the\\nlongest claw on the male obtained measuring, with dividers, 55 millimeters.   They appear to be much worn.\\niiUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      IT0L- 24\\nUrsus amerieanus amerieanus Pallas.   Black Bear\\nBlack bears occur in some abundance throughout the whole of the\\nregion we traversed. They are frequently seen from the river boat\\nin its travels up and down the Stikine. On June 5 one was seen not\\nfar from our camp at the Junction, rooting about under some rotten\\nlogs near the trail. Fresh tracks or other sign of the recent presence\\nof black bears were seen practically everywhere we went except on\\nSergief Island.\\nFive black bear skulls were purchased from Mr. A. M. Vickery,\\nof Telegraph Creek, the animals having been killed by him while he\\nwas patrolling the telegraph line to the southward of that place. One\\nof these (no. 31017) is an old male, killed 122 miles south of Telegraph\\nCreek, on May 25, 1919. The others are an old female and three small\\ncubs (nos. 31018-31021) killed on June 17, 1919, 31 miles south of\\nTelegraph Creek.\\nThe two adult skulls from the Telegraph Creek region present\\ncertain evident points of difference from those of the black bear (U. a.\\npugnax) from the islands of southeastern Alaska. In the former the\\nfrontal region is relatively high and rounded, in the latter it is noticeably low and flat. In pugnax the whole skull is more angular in appearance. In pugnax, too, the teeth are large, as compared with those\\nof bears from the interior, especially the last upper molar. This last\\ncharacter is one that persists in black bears from all the islands off\\nthe coast of southern Alaska and British Columbia. It is conspicuous\\nin pugnax of the southern islands of the Alexander Archipelago, which\\nhas a large, squarely built, low browed skull. It is one of the characters of carlottae, from the Queen Charlotte Islands (cf. Osgood, 1901,\\np. 30), which has an elongate skull. It appears again in the black\\nbear of Vancouver Island, which, judging from the several specimens\\nat hand, is a smaller animal than carlottae or pugnax, with a rather\\nhigh, rounded skull, and with the teeth of large size, especially the last\\nupper molar.\\nThere is very little material at hand from the mainland coast of\\nsoutheastern Alaska. One rather young male from Bradfield Canal\\n(a short distance south of the Stikine River) has the enlarged last\\nupper molar of pugnax, and is apparently to be referred to that form.\\nThus it may be that pugnax occupies a narrow strip of coast on the\\nmainland of southeastern Alaska as well as the islands, and that the\\ntype of black bear found in the Telegraph Creek region is confined to\\nthe territory east of the coastal range of mountains.L922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        161\\nOf the available material, the Telegraph Creek skulls are most\\nnearly of the type of those from the Kenai Peninsula and Takutat\\nBay, Alaska. It may be that the name given to the black bear of the\\nKenai region by Allen (1910, p. 115), Ursus amerieanus perniger,\\nshould also be applied to the bears of the Stikine section, but at present\\nit seems best to use the name amerieanus for the Stikine specimens.\\nA revision of the group is necessary to determine, among other things,\\nthe applicability of the name Ursus americamis Pallas, and the characters pertaining to the form to which that name should be subspecifi-\\ncally restricted. In the present connection the main interest lies in\\nthe apparent occurrence of two different forms of the black bear in\\nthe Stikine region, amerieanus at the headwaters of the river, and\\npugnax in the coastal region near its mouth.\\nOanis occidentalis Richardson. Timber Wolf\\nWolves, from all accounts, occur in some numbers throughout the\\ninterior of northern British Columbia, along the length of the Stikine\\nValley, and along the adjoining Alaskan coast and on the nearby\\nislands. We saw none, nor any fresh sign, until we reached Sergief\\nIsland. There fresh wolf tracks were seen in the sand of the river\\nbank, and on several occasions, when shooting out on the marsh, the\\nreports of our guns started wolves howling in the forest nearby. On\\nAugust 20 two of the animals were seen, and investigation showed that\\nthe place was the home of a wolf family, as it probably had been since\\nthe young were born, two or three months earlier. The two we saw\\nwere pups, not yet full grown, and they were probably awaiting the\\nparent's return from a foraging expedition. Certain areas in the\\ngrass had been trampled flat, for beds, and a large flat rock nearby\\nfurnished an ideal lounging place. This rock rose above the marsh\\ngrass, and thus afforded an excellent observation station. Some cracks\\nin the granite gave foothold to two scrubby spruce trees, arching over\\nthe rocky platform, and the rock below was covered with a deep layer\\nof spruce needles, affording a dry, soft bed. This shelter had been\\noccupied so much that the wolf smell clinging to it was apparent even\\nto the duller olfactories of a human being. Broad trails led away\\nthrough the grass over the marshes in various directions and into the\\nimpenetrable fastnesses of the spruce woods on the adjoining hillside.\\nThe trampled grass showed here and there bunches of feathers or a\\nfew crushed bones of ducks and geese; water fowl were evidently a\\nstaple food.\\nm\\nI162 University of California Publications in Zoology      iVoL- 24\\nHI II\\n8H1?5 $\\nill\\nMali\\nWm -\\nThere were apparently three pups and one adult in this family.\\nTwo of the young were taken, and the old wolf then removed the\\nsurvivor, evidently to some distance; no trace of the two was found\\nanywhere about the island. The parent had been seen several times\\nbefore the two young were caught.\\nMr. W. E. Parrott, living upon Sergief Island, gave us the skin\\nof an adult male wolf that he had shot on July 20. He was sitting\\nat breakfast when his cat rushed into the house for protection from the\\nwolf, which had chased the cat through the garden. Looking through\\nthe window, he saw the wolf, leisurely retreating toward the beach, and\\nshot the animal. It was no new experience for the cat. Whenever his\\nowner went to town a ladder' was left leaning against the house, as a\\nrefuge in case of such pursuit, and apparently there was not infrequent occasion to use it.\\nThe wolf thus obtained may have .been the male parent of the\\nfamily we encountered. In color this adult and the two pups are very\\nmuch alike. The adult is rather dark, though not so black as some\\nfrom this region. There is a good deal of black on the upperparts\\nfrom the eyes to the tip of the tail, produced by black tippings to long\\nhairs that are yellowish or reddish basally, the muzzle is reddish, the\\nlegs decidedly reddish, and the underparts a somewhat paler brown.\\nIt is not a gray appearing animal at all. The two pups are somewhat\\nduller colored, with the black not so intense, and the reddish areas\\npaler.   In life, however, the young wolves looked quite dark.\\nThere is at hand an adult male wolf from Prince of Wales Island,\\nAlaska (southwestward from Sergief Island), that is almost entirely\\nblack. Another specimen from the interior, the Yukon region, is also\\nblack, so that evidently dark color alone can not be considered as distinguishing the wolves of either of these two regions. Two skulls of\\nfully adult wolves from Iskut Summit, sixty miles southeast of Telegraph Creek, do not present any obvious points of difference from the\\nabove mentioned adult from Prince of Wales Island. The latter has\\nbeen recorded by the present write'r (Swarth, 1911, p. 136) as Canis\\npambasileus Elliot, in the belief that that name was applicable to a\\ncoastal subspecies. The Prince of Wales specimen presents characters\\nof size and color such as are ascribed to pambasileus (Elliot, 1905,\\np. 79). Whether or not the name pambasileus may properly be used\\nfor a local race from the type locality, the Mt. MeKinley 'region it\\ndoes not seem that any distinction can be made as between the wolf\\nIfj19221\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        163\\nof the coast of southeastern Alaska and the wolf of the adjoining interior. In the light of our limited material, and with the lack of a\\nsystematic revision of this group of mammals, it is safer to consider\\nthem as all one form, to which the name Canis occidentalis Richardson\\nseems applicable.\\nThe material obtained by us in the Stikine region consists of the\\nfollowing specimens: skulls and limb bones of two adults (nos. 31042,\\n31043) taken at Iskut Summit, sixty miles southeast of Telegraph\\nCreek, the gift of an acquaintance at Telegraph Creek; an adult male\\n(apparently not quite full grown), skin only (no. 31009), shot at\\nSergief Island, July 20, 1919; and two young females (about half-\\ngrown), skins and skulls (nos. 31010, 31011), taken at Sergief Island\\non August 24 and August 25, 1919.\\nMustela cicognani richardsoni Bonaparte. Richardson Weasel\\nWeasels undoubtedly occur throughout the region traversed, though\\nwe ourselves did not see one during the summer. At a trapper's cabin\\na few miles from Telegraph Creek a pile of desiccated weasel carcasses,\\nhis catch of the previous winter, yielded a series of nineteen skulls\\n(nos. 31023-31041), with complete skeletons in most eases. These\\nskulls, in comparison with a series from the coast of southeastern\\nAlaska, exhibit the differences stated by Merriam (1896, pp. 11-13)\\nto distinguish the two subspecies, Mustela c. richardsoni of the interior\\nand M. c. alascensis of the coast. The Telegraph Creek skulls, as is\\nclaimed for richardsoni, are perceptibly narrower between the orbits\\nand across the muzzle, and there is a slight difference in the shape of\\nthe zygomatic arches in the two lots.\\nAllen (1903, p. 563) has described Putorius microtis from Shesley,\\nBritish Columbia, near the headwaters of the Stikine, but our series\\nof skulls from Telegraph Creek are evidently all of one species, Mustela\\nc. richardsoni.\\nMustela vison energumenos (Bangs). British Columbia Mink\\nOne trapped at Doch-da-on Creek on July 19 (no. 31002), and a\\nskeleton preserved that was picked up near Telegraph Creek (no.\\n31022). The species occurs, probably in fair abundance, throughout\\nthe whole Stikine region. The one skin obtained is notably dark colored as compared with specimens of Mustela v. nesolestes from certain\\nislands of the Alexander Archipelago, and we were told that the mink\\n? 1164\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     IT0L- 24\\n\\u25a0 i '\\u2022is\\n'i\\u00abHJ:| 'HI  (\\u25a0';! |\\nfrom the Stikine were all dark.

Thus the specimens available suggest the\\nexistence of a dark colored mainland form extending toward the coast\\nat least along the larger rivers, and reaching some of the islands lying\\nnearest the mainland, and a lighter colored subspecies existing upon\\nmost of the islands of the Alexander Archipelago. There is not sufficient material available, however, to verify this surmise.\\nAt any rate, the mink of the upper Stikine Valley is a relatively\\nsmall form, and not the large ingens of the nearby Yukon drainage.\\nAt present it seems proper to use for this race the name' Mustela vison\\nenergumenos (Bangs), originally applied to the mink of southern\\nBritish Columbia.

(Museum numbers 30569-30705, 31050.)1922\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n165\\nA series of white-footed mice collected at and near Telegraph Creek\\nin 1902 has been reported upon by Allen (1903, p. 540) under the\\nname Peromyscus arcticus (Mearns) (== Peromyscus maniculatus\\nborealis Mearns [1911, p. 102]). What is undoubtedly the same series\\nof specimens is listed by Osgood (1909a, p. 49) under Peromyscus\\nmaniculatus arcticus (Mearns). Therefore, though this museum possesses no examples of Peromyscus maniculatus borealis other than our\\nseries from the Telegraph Creek region, I feel justified, on the grounds\\nabove mentioned, in assuming this series to be representative of the\\nsubspecies borealis. The chief interest attaching to the Telegraph\\nCreek form in the present connection lies in its relationship to the\\nsubspecies Peromyscus m. macrorhim/ws, from the region adjacent to\\nthe mouth of the Stikine River. Of macrorhi/mis this museum possesses an abundant representation from various points in southeastern\\nAlaska.\\nBefore proceeding with a discussion of the specimens we collected,\\ncertain features of the problem should be stated, in the interest of a\\nclear understanding of conditions. Osgood (1909a) in his comments\\nupon arcticus (= borealis) and macrorhinus makes no direct comparison between the two; at that time there were no specimens extant to\\nshow that these forms came together at any point. From his \\\"key\\\"\\nand descriptions, however, certain contrasting characters of these subspecies may be summarized as follows:\\nPeromyscus m. macrorhinus. General size larger; hind foot, 24 to\\n25 mm. Tail longer than head and body; usually more than 90, often\\nmore than 100 mm.   Coloration darker.\\nPeromyscus m. borealis. General size smaller; hind foot, 19 to 21\\nmm. Tail about equal to or shorter than head and body; usually less\\nthan 90 mm.   Coloration paler.\\nOn the Alaskan coast just north of the habitat of macrorhinus is\\n. the subspecies hylaeus. Between hylaeus and borealis, in the region\\nnorth of Telegraph Creek, is the subspecies algidus, '' the interior representative of the dark coast form hylaeus\\\" (Osgood, 1909a. p. 56).\\nAccording to Osgood (loc. cit.), algidus and borealis occur together in\\nplaces within the general range of the former, and maintain their distinctness. Algidus, compared with borealis, is a long-tailed form; it\\ndiffers from the latter in this respect just as macrorhinus does. Allen\\n(1903, p. 544) records as Peromyscus oreas a single mouse taken in\\nthe Cheonnee Mountains (near Telegraph Creek), where borealis also\\nwas secured. This same specimen, presumably, is recorded by Osgood\\n(loc. cit.) as algidus.   The Cheonnee Mountains are a short distance\\n111 III\\n**^rf     H Pill\\n!'j. i\\n^Jl!'1'..'\\\"\\n166\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      IT0L- 24\\nsoutheast of Telegraph Creek; if algidus occurs in that range it should\\nbe at Telegraph Creek also.\\nWe obtained several long-tailed specimens of Peromyscus at and\\nnear Telegraph Creek, and supposed that they were examples of\\nalgidus. Study of the series as a whole, however, inclines me to another explanation of the variation, that seems more satisfactory,\\nnamely, that there is continuous distribution of Peromyscus along the\\nStikine Valley, from the habitat of borealis in the interior to that of\\nmacrorhinus on the coast, that there is intergradation between these\\ntwo subspecies in the Stikine Valley, that Telegraph Creek is about\\nthe easternmost point to which intergrades with macrorhinus extend,\\nand that the variants obtained by us at that point are all the results\\nof intergradation.\\nThe long-tailed individuals from the Telegraph Creek region, aside\\nfrom this peculiarity, are not notably different in color or otherwise\\nfrom the general run of specimens obtained there. At any rate, they\\ncould not be grouped together as presenting an aggregation of characters justifying their separation, as a distinct subspecies. Neither\\nwere they obtained under circumstances that would tend to establish\\nthe belief that two different races were concerned.\\nThe Peromyscus taken at the Junction are lighter colored than\\nmacrorhinus of the coast, and they are smaller and shorter tailed. This\\nstation is some five miles north of the Stikine River; presumably these\\nmice are more nearly typical of borealis than any others we obtained.\\nIn this series there is one aberrant individual with an exceedingly\\nlong tail; otherwise there is great uniformity in the lot. At the town\\nof Telegraph Creek we obtained more long-tailed mice, and noted a\\nslight increase in general size, as compared with the series from the\\nJunction. Descending the Stikine River from Telegraph Creek, the\\nPeromyscus collected at our various stations were progressively larger\\nand darker colored as the coast was approached.\\nThe accompanying diagrams (figs. R, S, T) show variation in hind\\nfoot, length of tail vertebrae, and ratio of tail vertebrae to total length,\\nin the white-footed mice taken at our various collecting stations in the\\nStikine region, as compared with macrorhinus of the Alaskan coast.\\nColor and general size vary in about the same way as the characters\\nillustrated. Barring the series from the Junction, which are probably\\nclose to true borealis, the Stikine River Peromyscus are typical of\\nneither borealis nor macrorhinus. They form a series of intergrades\\nbetween the two.   It is not possible to draw a hard and fast line as a1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        167\\nboundary, both on account of the gradual change in the entire Peromyscus population of the intermediate territory and because of individual variation, which brings typical examples of each far within the\\nmargin on either side of the debatable strip. Allowing for such variation, however, it seems proper, though an arbitrary division, to consider as borealis the mice from the upper Stikine, as far down as\\nGlenora, macrorhinus extending up stream as far as Doch-da-on Creek.\\nborealis\\nmacrorhinus\\n{Ijo\\nH                       f\\n|                 3                |\\nE             O\\no\\n26\\n25\\n24\\n23\\n22\\n21\\n20\\n19\\n-\\n14\\nA\\n\\\\\\n2^/\\n15\\n To\\n24,\\nr\\u2014               22\\n24\\nFig. R.

At Telegraph Creek\\nmost of our specimens were caught in the house in which we were\\nstaying; a few were taken in our several trap lines a mile or more\\nfrom town. The rows of empty houses at Glenora formed a haven for\\nwhite-footed mice, and they swarmed there in almost incredible numbers.

At Telegraph Creek specimens were\\ntaken in the talus at the base of certain rocky cliffs that rise back of\\nthe town. The rats were not numerous, and after one or two had been\\ncaught at a place the traps usually remained undisturbed. The old\\nhouses of the abandoned town of Glenora afforded shelter to the wood\\nrats, but apparently not more than one or two families occupied any\\none cabin. From several of the cabins the rats had well worn trails\\nleading into the surrounding thickets. There they cut quantities of\\ngreen vegetation, some to be carried into the houses and eaten at once,\\nsome apparently to be dried for later use.

Wrangell Lemming Mouse\\nFound at but one place on the river, at Great Glacier. Three\\nspecimens obtained (nos. 30752-30754), all males, taken on August 10,\\n13, and 14, respectively. Just one, the largest and the only one that\\nis fully mature, shows the gray patches over the hip glands. All\\nthree were trapped in alder thickets, in places frequented by Evotomys.\\nThere have been available for comparison three specimens of lemming mice (in the E. P. Walker collection), from Wrangell, Alaska,\\nthe type locality of Synaptomys wra/ngeU, ten from mainland points\\nin southeastern Alaska, ranging from Boca de Quadra to Port Snet-\\ntisham, and nine from the Prince William Sound region, Alaska. I\\nalso received, as a loan from the United States Biological Survey, six\\ntypical specimens of Synaptomys borealis dalli, three from points near\\nthe base of the Alaska Peninsula, two from the Kuskokwim drainage,\\nand one from the Yukon.\\nAs far as I can see, the specimens from the coast of southeastern\\nAlaska, island and mainland, are all alike. They are all wrangeli.\\nFurthermore, the differences between wrangeli and dalli are slight,\\nand as these differences in the series here assembled are bridged by\\nindividual variation and to some extent by geographic variation, I\\nconsider the two forms as subspecies of one species, Synaptomys borealis. (For the use of this name, see Preble, 1908, pp. 183-186. See\\nalso Hollister, 1912, p. 19.)\\nThe skull of dalli, compared with wrangeli, is somewhat larger, and\\nrather more angular, and more heavily built. Otherwise, I can see no\\ndifferences in the two lots. Some of those from the Prince William\\nSound region incline toward dalli in their larger size, as compared\\nwith more southern specimens, indicating, perhaps, intergradation between wrangeU and dalli at what is probably the northern limit of the\\nform wrangell. Externally, four specimens of dalli are appreciably\\nmore reddish than any in the wrangeli series. The two remaining\\ndalli are of the same coloration as the mode of wrangeli.\\nThus, instead of wrangeli being an insular species, confined to\\nWrangell Island, my conception of it is as being a rather wide ranging\\nform, and a coastal subspecies, contrasted with dalli of the interior.\\nIts range is the coast of southeastern Alaska, from Prince William\\nSound south at least to Boca de Quadra. It has been taken upon two\\nislands, Hinchinbrook Island, Prince William Sound, and Wrangell\\nIsland, both but slightly separated from the mainland.1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n173\\nAnother species, Synaptomys andersoni, has been described by\\nAllen (1903, p. 554), based upon a single specimen from Level Mountain, near the headwaters of the Stikine River. In all likelihood,\\ntherefore, mice of this genus occur throughout the entire length of the\\nStikine Valley. At present, however, with the few specimens extant\\nin collections, it is not possible to form an opinion as to whether or\\nnot there are two species or subspecies in existence, at the head of\\nthe river, and toward its mouth, respectively.\\nEvotomys dawsoni dawsoni Merriam. Dawson Red-backed Mouse\\nAn adult female (no. 30720) was taken at the Junction, .June 4,\\ntrapped during the day on a dry, poplar-covered hillside.

The next\\nobtained (no. 30721) was caught at Doch-da-on Creek, July 17, in a\\ntangle of alders, grass, and nettles bordering a slough. This specimen\\nis a male, not fully mature but evidently referable to dawsoni. Somewhere in the section of the river between Doch-da-on Creek and Flood\\nGlacier lies the dividing line between dawsoni and wrangeli.

Of this\\nseries there is one old male (no: 30735, Great Glacier), with conspicuous gray patches over the hip glands, and showing rooted molars\\nwith deeply worn surfaces. There are eleven more that may be termed\\nadult, as being in the adult pelage (though none of these has the gray\\nflank patches more than faintly indicated). The remainder are young\\nat various stages of growth.\\nThe red-backed mice from these three stations are all E. wrangeli,\\nindistinguishable from specimens at hand from Wrangell Island. The\\nrange of that species is thus carried far inland up the Stikine Valley,\\nvery close to the habitat of dawsoni, if in fact the two do not meet.\\nThe four specimens from the uppermost station, Flood Glacier, show\\nno appreciable departure from the mode of wrangeli; there is no\\nindication here of intergradation toward the nearly adjacent dawsoni.\\nThe two species, however, resemble each other so closely in form,\\nand in some pelages in color also, that wrangeli would seem to be a\\ncoastal offshoot of dawsoni, bearing somewhat the same relation to that\\nJ174\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [Vol. 24\\nspecies as Microtus admiraltiae, of Admiralty Island, does to M. drum-\\nmondi of the adjacent mainland.

Most that were caught were taken in weed-grown bottom lands.\\nAt Flood Glacier, well defined runways, with many little piles of\\nfreshly cut green stuff, gave an appearance of an abundance of\\nmeadow mice, but despite the plentiful sign, specimens were taken but\\nslowly. Apparently one full-grown Microtus can establish and operate\\nan elaborate system of runways. One weed-grown area some fifty feet\\nsquare, intersected with well used paths in which were found fifteen\\nor twenty little piles of freshly cut green weed stems, yielded just one\\nadult meadow mouse. At Great Glacier but two specimens were\\ntrapped.\\nThe occurrence of a meadow mouse of the longicaudus group over\\nthe entire length of the Stikine River is of interest as bearing upon\\nthe relationship of Microtus mordax of the interior and M. macrurus\\nof the coast. The two forms are closely related, and though heretofore recognized as distinct species, the differences between them are\\ncomparable to what is found among subspecies of some one species in\\nother sections of the genus. The main differences between the two\\nare of coloration and of length of tail. There are skull differences\\nalso but not trenchant ones. Macrurus, like other coastal species, is\\nof dark brownish coloration, quite reddish-brown dorsally; mordax\\nis distinctly gray. Macrurus has a longer tail than mordax, longer in\\nactual measurement and longer in relation to total length. Both\\nmacrurus and mordax in the northern parts of their respective ranges\\n(southeastern Alaska and northern British Columbia) are somewhat\\nsmaller than they are at their southern limits.\\nWe obtained long-tailed meadow mice at various points on the\\nStikine River down as far as Great Glacier, and I have at hand several\\nadditional specimens (from the collection of E. P. Walker) taken at\\nClearwater Creek, just below the British Columbia-Alaska boundary\\nline. There are also available specimens from Wrangell and Mitkof\\nislands (near the mouth of the Stikine), and from various points on\\nthe mainland short distances north and south of the mouth of the\\nriver. Macrurus is abundantly represented in the collection of this\\nMuseum from various points in the Alexander Archipelago.1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        111\\nMacrurus, as represented by specimens from the more western\\nislands of the Alexander Archipelago, is a very different looking animal\\nfrom mordax of the interior. The brown coloration of the one, and the\\ngray of the other, correlated with the differences in size and length of\\ntail, render the two series absolutely unlike. Meadow mice from Mitkof\\nand Wrangell islands, however, are, in color, about midway between\\nthe extremes indicated, and the few specimens at hand from the lower\\nStikine tend still further to bridge the gap. As regards color, it is\\npossible to arrange specimens with regard to geographical position,\\nso as to produce a graded series of changes from one extreme to the\\nother, with no abrupt break at any point.

Spatulata, as represented in\\nthis Museum by comparable specimens from various parts of its range\\nto the northward of the Stikine, is decidedly reddish. Our Sergief\\nIsland specimens are closely similar to fall examples of osoyoosensis\\nfrom the Puget Sound region. Some of the latter have an indication\\nof cinnamon on the underparts and sides, which is seen in none of the\\nSergief Island specimens, but there are certain skins from the neighborhood of Seattle that are exactly like them in color. Osoyoosensis,\\nhowever, is a large species, and the specimens in question are of small\\nsize, agreeing with spatulata in this respect. Thus the Sergief Island\\nmuskrats are like osoyoosensis in color, like spatulata in size. The\\nskull is of the spatulata type, being relatively broad, with wide spreading zygomata.\\nThere are five muskrats at hand (Mus. Vert.

In the meantime, while those from the\\nlatter point are not particularly like spatulata, I prefer to list them\\nby that name, as the race they most nearly resemble, rather than\\napply a new one, based upon characters.the meaning of which is not\\nunderstood.r\\n$m\\\\\\n1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        181\\nTABLE IV\\nMeasurements ir\\ni millimet\\n3rs of adult Ondatra\\nTotal length      Tail vertebrae\\nHind\\nfoot\\n30996\\n30998\\n31006\\n9 ad.\\no\\\" ad.\\nd\\\" ad.\\nSergief Id., Alaska\\nSergief Id., Alaska\\nSergief Id., Alaska\\n502\\n520\\n590\\n235\\n225\\n246\\n76\\n74\\n77\\nAverage of 4 adults of Ondatra z. spatulata,\\nnorthern British Columbia and Alberta1     530\\nAverage of 10 adults of Ondatra z. osoyoosensis,\\nfrom Oroville, Wash.2 589\\n'Hollister, 1911, p. 22\\n2Hollister, 1911, p. 25\\n232\\n271\\n74.5\\n83\\nJ\\nMus musculus muscuius Linnaeus.

We ran across more or less sign on the bare ridges\\nabove Doch-da-on Creek in July; on July 23 one of the animals was1922J Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        183\\nseen there, far above the timber, too wary for a near approach. On\\nKirk's Mountain, some miles north of Doch-da-on Creek^ Dixon heard\\na number of marmots whistling.\\nAt Flood Glacier some marmots were residing in rock piles at the\\nbase of the mountain, several miles back from the river but at a not\\nmuch higher altitude.    Dixon shot two here on August 1, an adult\\n..male (no. 31005) and a young one, perhaps a quarter grown (no.\\n31004).   The species was not encountered farther down the river.\\nThe marmots of the mountains about Doch-da-on Creek and Glenora\\nmay well be Marmota caligata oxytona Hollister. This would be at\\nabout the western limit of that subspecies. The adult male from Flood\\nGlacier has a large skull, well within the limits of oxytona, and exhibiting the characters of that race as detailed by Howell (1915, p. 63),\\nbut in external measurements this animal is no larger than coastal\\nspecimens of the subspecies caligata. The young male from Flood\\nGlacier is at the same stage of growth as a young caligata at hand\\nfrom the mouth of the Chickamin River, Alaska, and the two are indistinguishable in appearance. The peculiarities of the skull in the adult\\nmay be an indication of intergradation between caligata and oxytona\\nin the middle reaches of the Stikine, but the material at hand does not\\nsuffice to settle that point.\\nCitellus plesius plesius (Osgood).   Bennett Ground Squirrel\\nOn June 4 two ground squirrels were taken at the Summit (nos.\\n30994, 30995), and one other was seen. This same place was visited on\\nMay 29 and again on June 5 without any animals being encountered.\\nIt was still quite wintry at that altitude, with much snow on the\\nground and ice on the lakes, and it seemed likely that most of the\\nground squirrels were still in hibernation. M. P. Anderson had found\\nthem in abundance at the Summit in July and August, 1902 (Allen,\\n1903, p. 534). The species occurs in the Stikine region only on the\\nmountain slopes above timber line; it is found nowhere in the lower\\nvalleys.\\nThe three animals seen were all observed within a radius of two\\nhundred yards. There were a number of fresh looking burrows at\\nthe same place. These holes were scattered, though sometimes there\\nwere two or three fairly close together; some were amid thickets of\\nlow bushes, others out in the open meadows. They were small, considering the size of the animal, and there were no noticeable mounds\\nof earth at the entrances.

The female contained four small embryos. Anderson (Allen, loc. cit.) in 1902 collected young squirrels \\\"one-fourth to one-half grown\\\" at the same\\nplace on July 31.\\nWhen we were at Glenora two acquaintances who were camped\\nnearby made a trip to the summit of Glenora Mountain, which rises\\njust north of the town. They reported an abundance of ground\\nsquirrels on the slopes above the timber. We kept a careful lookout\\nfor the species on the mountains above Doch-da-on Creek where the\\nsurroundings were apparently ideal, but saw none of the animals nor\\nany burrows or other certain sign of their presence.\\nEutamias borealis caniceps Osgood.   Gray-headed Chipmunk\\nOf general distribution in the region about Telegraph Creek and\\nGlenora; not abundant but apt to be encountered anywhere in the\\nlowlands. At Doch-da-on Creek chipmunks were noticeably less abundant, and the species was not seen at all farther down the river. While\\napparently mostly at low altitudes, chipmunks were sometimes found\\nwell up the mountain sides. On July 11 one was seen at timber line\\n(about 3000 feet) above Doch-da-on Creek.\\nDandelions were a favorite food. Toward the end of June and in\\nJuly these were going to seed, and chipmunks were constantly seen\\nstripping the fluffy heads. Individuals had certain favorite spots for\\neating, and at such places there were heaps of dandelion fuzz and\\nparts of the blossoms.\\nTwenty-eight specimens were collected (nos. 30946-30973), as follows : Telegraph Creek, fifteen.adults; Glenora, five adults; Doch-da-on\\nCreek, two adults and six young.\\nThe chipmunk of the Telegraph Creek region was identified as\\nEutamias caniceps by Allen (1903, p. 533). Preble (1908, p. 169)\\nconsiders caniceps as a subspecies of Eutamias borealis, and I am here\\nfollowing his opinion. No topotypes of caniceps nor any examples of\\nborealis have been available for comparison.\\nSciurus hudsonicus hudsonicus (Erxleben). Northern Red Squirrel\\nSciurus hudsonicus picatus Swarth.

At Doch-da-on Creek\\nthey were less numerous, due perhaps to their having been incidentally\\nkilled by the systematic trapping that had been carried on during the\\nprevious winter over much of the ground we covered at that point.\\nAt Flood Glacier and Great Glacier, red squirrels were extremely\\nscarce. We realized, of course, the fact that this species occurred as\\ntwo different geographic races, at the mouth of the Stikine and at the\\nhead of the river, respectively, and that there was probably continuous\\ndistribution of the species for the entire length of the stream.

Six specimens from Telegraph Creek\\nwere submitted to Mr. B. A. Preble, of the United States Biological\\nSurvey, for subspecific determination. His conclusion is that these\\nsquirrels are \\\"virtually identical with Sciurus h. hudsonicus. In some\\nrespects, notably in the color of the back, they show some slight approach to S. h. petulans of the coast. They agree, however, with\\nhudsonicus as regards the color of the fringe of the tail.'' The Glenora\\nand Doch-da-on Creek specimens are clearly in the same category as\\nthe Telegraph Creek specimens; they are all S. h. hudsonicus. The\\nsquirrels from Flood Glacier, Great Glacier, and Sergief Island are\\njust as unequivocally S. h. picatus.\\nAs between hudsonicus and picatus, there are differences of color\\nand of the skull. Red squirrels from Doch-da-on Creek (three full-\\ngrown young) are in both respects typical of hudsonicus and they represent the farthest point down stream at which this subspecies was\\ntaken. Our next collecting station was Flood Glacier, some forty miles\\ndown the river, and, as noted, there was taken at that point but the\\none red squirrel, typical of picatus, both as regards color and skull.\\nWhether there actually is a stretch of country in this intermediate\\nregion where red squirrels are as scarce as our experience seems\\nto indicate, or whether we were merely unlucky in the necessarily\\nlimited areas our field work covered at Flood Glacier and Great Glacier,\\nremains still to be determined. It may be, of course, that there is\\nactually a notable scarcity of the animals throughout this intermediate\\nregion, that there is some attribute of the country that is unfavorable\\nto the red squirrel, and hence serves to keep apart these two subspecies.\\n(For the use of the name Sciurus hudsonicus picatus see Swarth,\\n1921&, p. 92.)\\nWe gained but little information regarding the life history of the\\nred squirrel in the region explored. Near the Junction individuals\\nWere several times seen to enter holes in the ground, holes that, from\\ntheir appearance, evidently served as homes. Squirrel nests were\\nsometimes seen in the trees, but they were not numerous. Females\\ncollected May 25 and 26 contained embryos, four and five in number,\\nand about 30 millimeters long. A young male shot at Glenora, July 2,\\nis about two-thirds the length of an adult, and about a quarter the\\nweight. The three young ones from Doch-da-on Creek, taken July 14,\\n17, and 22, respectively, are nearly full-grown, being but slightly\\nbelow adults in measurements and weight.1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        187\\nThe first red squirrel collected near Telegraph Creek, on May 26,\\nhad almost completely finished the molt into the summer pelage. Others\\nshot during the next two weeks are either in the winter pelage throughout or else variously advanced in the change, showing ragged patches\\nof the old coat. Those taken farther down the river are all in summer\\npelage.\\nAn adult female taken at Glenora July 4 (no. 30986) has the\\nincisors of both jaws malformed so that they could not meet, the two\\nlower teeth passing together to the left of the upper ones. All four\\nhad grown to abnormal length, but not so much so as to endanger the\\nanimal's life. They were evidently worn down somewhat by the friction sideways; the teeth are beveled, but not oh the same plane as in\\nnormal individuals. This squirrel was in good condition, in fact there\\nwas some fat under the skin. A western goshawk collected at Flood\\nGlacier contained in its stomach the remains of a red squirrel; doubtless\\nall the hawks of the region prey upon this species to some extent.\\niij   \\u2022\\u2022\\nTABLE V\\nMeasurements in millimeters of Sciurus from the Stikine Region and from south\\neastern Alaska\\nSciurus hudsonicus hudsonicus\\n30975\\n30976\\n30977\\n30978\\n30982\\n30983\\n30987\\nc?

On June 18 fresh rabbit tracks were\\nseen in the dust of a trail some five or six miles west of Telegraph\\nCreek, and on July 7 a young rabbit about two-thirds grown (no.\\n31003) was taken near the Stikine River opposite Glenora.

There are undoubtedly many obscure little ponds hidden \\\"in\\nthe woods and blind sloughs and channels running back from the river\\nthat still shelter small and scattered colonies, but the beavers have been\\nso nearly extirpated in this region that trapping is no longer profitable.\\nA few miles from Telegraph Creek there were beaver ponds, some\\nof considerable size, but we were told that the beavers had long been\\nwiped out. At Glenora, one evening, the resounding \\\"plop\\\" of a\\nbeaver's tail in the water near the river's edge gave evidence of one\\nsurvivor, at least.

Moose are known to occur regularly even farther\\ndown stream, and we were told of one being killed at the river's mouth\\nsome years ago.

A search of the bushes from which she had emerged disclosed a newly born calf, still unable to do more than totter about on\\nits long and very wobbly legs.\\nDixon's observations upon this animal read in part as follows:\\nWhen first found, on the very spot where it was born, the calf was not frightened\\nbut came up to me, whining like a puppy dog. Later this low whine was found\\nto be a usual call note of the youngster. The moose characters of large ears,\\noverhanging nose, high shoulders, low rump, and long legs, were all conspicuous.\\nThe face and particularly the ears, were much lighter colored than the body.\\nAn incipient mane of black hairs showed as a narrow line from the back of the\\nhead to a point just back of the shoulders. The metatarsal glands were conspicuously eolored by a patch of whitish hairs covering an area one inch long\\nby one-half inch wide. The body was clothed with thick warm hair, plumbeous\\nat the basal half, then brown, and with a faint tipping of- black. In walking\\non level ground the young moose stood 30 inches high at the shoulder and 27\\ninches at the rump. The distance from the nose to the tip of the tail in life\\nwas 30 inches.\\nThe sense of hearing was most keen, sight second, and smell last. A cracking\\ntwig always startled her violently. The upper eyelid had eyelashes over an\\ninch long, which helped to keep the myriad mosquitoes out of the eyes. A\\nswarm of these bloodthirsty pests were sucking blood from the helpless youngster\\nwhen first discovered.\\nIn attempting to nibble grass the little' moose knelt down on her front legs,\\nand in this position was able to bite off the tender grass with her eight sharp\\nlower incisors, well developed even in this 24 hour old calf- Attempts were\\nalso made to nibble budding willow twigs. In lying down she knelt on her\\nfront legs first, then the posterior was lowered and the long hind legs tucked\\nup under or to one side of the body. In getting up, the animal rose to its\\nknees on its front legs, and then the hind quarters were raised. By mid afternoon the young moose followed me about the camp so that I had difficulty in\\nkeeping far enough away to use the camera.\\nRangifer osborni Allen. Cassiar Caribou\\nWe ourselves were at no time in caribou territory, and my only\\nreason for including the species here is to place on record information\\nreceived regarding the distribution of this animal.

Twenty-\\nfive miles farther down the river there are other mountains with extensive areas rising above timber line, which have been hunted over for\\nmany years past by Captain A. B.

Columbian Mountain Goat\\nMountain goats are probably of general distribution on the higher\\nmountains from Telegraph Creek west to the coast. Our own experiences were limited to three localities. At Glenora, on July 3, an\\nacquaintance ascended the mountain that rises behind the town, and\\nhe told us that he saw two goats near the summit. On July 11 and 23\\nwe climbed the mountain just south of Doch-da-on Creek. As soon as\\nthe belt of upright timber was passed, goat sign was seen on all sides.\\nBroad, well-beaten trails wound through the thickets of prostrate\\nM\\n11\\nIII\\ni\\nII\\nv\\nJ\\n1192\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [^0Jj- 24\\nbalsam, to split again and again and finally become indistinguishable\\non the open grass-covered slopes above. The balsam branches along\\nthe trails were decorated with streamers of long white hair, caught from\\nthe shedding animals as they passed along. Recently occupied beds\\ncould be distinguished at many points, and numerous footprints and\\ndroppings all attested to the presence of mountain goats in some numbers. We saw none here, however, though on the 11th, when we started\\nto descend the mountain toward evening, fresh tracks were seen at one\\npoint where a goat had crossed our trail since morning.\\nFour days, July 16 to 19, were devoted by Dixon to a hunt on the\\nmountain above Kirk's Creek, some eight or ten miles north of Doch-\\nda-on Creek. He saw a number of the animals and shot an adult male\\n(no. 31008). Several were in sight at once when this one was killed,\\nand Dixon's observations on the behavior of the remainder of the band\\ninclude some interesting items.   His notes read in part as follows:\\nWhile we were skinning our specimen another goat came back, and after\\ngrazing about awhile laid down against a granite boulder, where, with head\\npropped up against a stone, he watched us as we worked. Although we were\\nin plain sight and only 150 yards away, he lay there placidly observing us. As\\nsoon as I started to sneak down out of sight, in an attempt to approach near\\nenough to get a photo, the goat got up and went over the ridge and across a\\nnarrow ravine, where he stood waiting, watching me as I came over the crest\\nof the ridge 100 yards away. I followed him over the next ridge and saw him\\ndisappear down a snow slide toward a hanging valley below. Prom this latter\\npoint I searched the cliffs above me with the binoeulars, and saw a goat lying\\nin a niche in the cliff, high above me. This animal lay motionless with outstretched neck, watching me intently. Going around the ridge out of sight\\nat one side of the cliff, I worked my way up to a level with him, then edged\\naround the cliff so that when I stepped out in sight I was less than thirty feet\\ndistant. The goat bounded to his feet, then slowly and deliberately jumped\\nfrom niche to niche along the face of the cliff until a slide was reached. Here\\nhe bounded and slid down, scattering the rocks as he went. The spot where he\\nhad been resting, about the center of the cliff, was like the eyrie of a golden\\neagle, and about as difficult of access. It seemed incredible that so large an\\nanimal could ever have reached it along the face of the cliff. A man certainly\\ncould not have done so.\\nHis tracks led across a snow slide to a cavity at the south side of a large\\nboulder. The snow melting away from the roek left a hole about six feet long,\\nthree feet wide and four feet deep, and in here the goat had lain down, resting\\non the snow and peering at me over the brink. Only the dark eyes and horns\\ncould be seen, the otherwise white coloration blending perfectly with the snow.\\nI walked down to within 100 feet of the animal and took two photos while he\\nlay perfectly still. Then I crawled to the edge of the snow bank, too steep\\nfor me to cross, and threw rocks at him. Arising, at first he stood his ground\\nstamping his fore feet or making feints at charging me. I finally struck him\\nwith a stone and he jumped to the edge of the snow bank, where he stood with\\narched neck and tail erect as though in challenge.    Then he started down the19221        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        193\\nsnowslide. With hind legs flexed and spread well apart, and front legs rigid,\\nalmost on his haunches, he slid and wriggled in safety down the dangerous slide,\\nwhich at the bottom dropped over a precipice. At the top of this cliff he\\ncrossed to the solid rock beyond, and then turned to see if I was coming.\\nThe goat taken was a male, fully mature but not of great age. His\\nweight was estimated at two hundred pounds. This animal has almost\\nnone of the long shaggy covering with which we usually associate the\\nspecies. It is white, just as in winter, but the hair is extremely short.\\nOver much of the body there is no more than a scanty covering of\\ntightly curled wool, which presumably would develop later into a dense\\nbody covering, completely hidden by the long straight hairs of the\\nwinter coat.\\nOreamnos montanus columbianus was described from the Shesley\\nMountains, in the same general region and some sixty or seventy miles\\nnorth of the place where our specimen was taken (see Allen, 1904, p.\\n20). Mountain goats occur on the mountains along the mainland\\ncoast of southeastern Alaska directly to the westward of this region,\\nand with very little doubt at all suitable places between. Whether or\\nnot the subspecies columbianus extends westward to the coast we have\\nnot the material to decide, though the specimens at hand suggest\\notherwise. There are three specimens available from the coast of southeastern Alaska, an adult female and two young males. The old female\\nhas horns that are nearly as widespreading as in a female Oreamnos\\nkennedyi, from Cook Inlet, of about the same age. They are more\\nwidespreading than in our adult male from the Telegraph Creek region.\\nThese are the only comparisons that it is feasible to make. This material thus suggests the possibility at least of the existence of a coastal\\nrace, kennedyi, as distinct from columbianus of the interior. In all\\nprobability kennedyi should be regarded as a subspecies of Oreamnos\\nmontanus, rather than a distinct species. There is with little doubt\\nsufficiently continuous distribution of mountain goats along the\\nAlaskan coast to insure intergradation between the several described\\nforms, and the goat occurring on the mainland of the Sitkan region\\nmay well prove to be referable to kennedyi, though perhaps not\\nexhibiting the characters of that race in their extreme.\\nm&\\nII ?University of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\nCHECK LIST OP BIRDS\\nColymbus holboelli (Bernhardt).\\nColymbus auritus Linnaeus.\\nGavia immer (Brunnieh).\\nLarus Philadelphia (Ord).\\nSterna paradisaea Brunnieh.\\nMergus amerieanus Cassin.\\nAnas platyrhynchos Linnaeus.\\nNettion carolinense  (Gmelin).\\nSpatula elypeata (Linnaeus).\\nDaflla acuta (Linnaeus).\\nMarila, sp.?\\nGlaueionetta islandica (Gmelin).\\nHistrionicus histrionicus  (Linnaeus).\\nOidemia deglandi Bonaparte.\\nBranta canadensis oceidentalis (Baird).\\nArdea herodias fannini Chapman.\\nGallinago delicata (Ord).\\nPisobia maculata (Vieillot).\\nPisobia minutilla (Vieillot).\\nTotanua melanoleucus (Gmelin).\\nTotanus flavipes (Gmelin).\\nTringa solitaria cinnamomea (Brewster).\\nActitis maeularia (Linnaeus).\\nOxyechus vociferus vociferus (Linnaeus).\\nDendragapus obscurus flemingi Taverner.\\nDendragapus obscurus sitkensis Swarth.\\nCanachites canadensis osgoodi Bishop.\\nCanachites canadensis atratus Grinnell.\\nBonasa umbellus.umbelloides (Douglas).\\nLagopus leucurus leueurus (Swainson).\\nZenajdura maeroura carolinensis (Linnaeus).\\nCircus hudsonius (Linnaeus).\\nAceipiter velox (Wilson).\\nAstur atricapillus atrieapillus (Wilson).\\nAstur atricapillus striatulus Ridgway.\\nButeo borealis calurus Cassin.\\nButeo swainsoni Bonaparte.\\nAquila ehrysaetos (Linnaeus).\\nHaliaeetus leueoeephalus alascanus C.

Common Loon\\nAt least one pair on Sawmill Lake. The birds were quiet and unobtrusive, never being heard calling at that point. Another pair,\\nencountered in a small lake near Doch-da-on Creek, was more noisy,\\nand our arrival at the lake shore was invariably heralded by an outburst of sound from both birds. At that time, the middle of July,\\nthey were caring for two young, apparently about a third grown. The\\nfour birds were almost always seen together.1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        197\\nLarus Philadelphia (Ord). Bonaparte Gull\\nOne or two flocks were seen just after we passed Dixon Entrance,\\ngoing north, on May 19. They were apparently migrating, the only\\nmigrants in evidence at that time, and were traveling in a manner\\ncharacteristic of the Bonaparte gull, but different from most of our\\nother species. The flocks were in compact formation and flying swiftly,\\nmore like large waders than gulls in appearance; there was no soaring\\nwhatever, and no lingering.\\nA single Bonaparte gull was seen on Sawmill Lake, June 17. A\\nsmall gull seen flying up stream past our Flood Glacier camp on\\nAugust 4 was probably of this species.\\nSterna paradisaea Briinnich.   Arctic Tern\\nOn our trip up stream, May 21 to 23, terns believed to be of this\\nspecies, were seen at intervals up to within thirty miles of Telegraph\\nCreek.

American Merganser\\nOn May 21, mergansers were seen in fair abundance at the mouth\\nof the Stikine; they lessened in numbers as we went up stream, and\\nfinally disappeared, none being observed above \\\"the canon.\\\" Those\\nthat came near enough for identification were all M. amerieanus.\\nLater in'the summer, at Flood Glacier, at least two different broods\\nof mergansers were seen, but of what species could not be ascertained.\\nOn July 29 a family of ten or twelve plunged into the stream opposite\\nour camp, hotly pursued by a bald eagle. The eagle was very much in\\nearnest, but it was curious to see, once the water was reached, the\\nindifference with which the mergansers regarded their formidable\\npursuer. None took the trouble to dive, even, except the one specifically\\nselected as a victim. Then, at the last moment, that particular individual disappeared easily beneath the water, leaving the eagle flounder:\\ning and gathering himself for another try at the flock.

Two\\nfemales were shot at the Summit, June 5, and one of them was preserved (no. 39707).   These two birds were evidently not breeding.\\nThe species encountered was apparently Glaucionetta islandica.\\nThe identity of the one specimen saved was determined mainly through\\na study of the characterization of the two forms, americana and islandica, as given by Brooks (1920, p. 356). This decision, though, is also\\ninfluenced by the fact that the adult males seen were unquestionably\\nislandica, the triangular white facial patch being plainly discernible\\nwith the binoculars.

White-cheeked Goose\\nWe were told of the occasional, though rare, occurrence of geese\\nas far up the river as Telegraph Creek, but it seems doubtful that\\nbirds seen so far inland should be occidentalis. In our ascent of the\\nStikine River, May 21 and 22, flocks of geese, presumably of this subspecies, were seen at intervals about as far up as Great Glacier. None\\nwas seen by us during the summer any farther inland. When we\\ncamped at Great Glacier in August, we found an abundance of old\\n\\\"sign\\\" of the presence of geese, many droppings on the sand bars about\\nsome shallow ponds, and the marks of webbed feet in sticky mud that\\nhad since remained undisturbed. The geese themselves had probably\\nnot visited the place for many weeks. These ponds, in a sheltered\\nlocation, apparently received a maximum of sunshine early in the\\nsummer, and were correspondingly attractive to the birds at that time.\\nIn our descent of the river, the first white-cheeked geese were seen\\nat the boundary, August 16. From there on down an occasional small\\nflock was noted, but not until the mouth of the river was reached were\\nthey seen in any numbers. At Sergief Island they were abundant.\\nFlocks of large size frequented the marshes at that point, changing\\ntheir feeding ground as the tides advanced and receded. These local\\nmovements covered but a few miles at most, and, of course, were gone\\nthrough with daily as regularly as the tides. Aside from this hourly\\nshifting, which kept some flocks on the wing practically throughout\\nthe day, there was no appearance of migration. Flocks of white-\\ncheeked geese were never seen to depart in a manner suggestive of the\\nbeginning of a long flight, nor were any seen arriving as though from\\na distance.\\nDuring the last two weeks in August the geese were still molting\\nextensively. In some the breast and belly were almost entirely devoid\\nof feathers, only the down remaining, and nearly all were renewing\\nthe tail feathers. Flight feathers were fully grown, or at any rate\\nsufficiently so for flying. Presumably the birds would not gather\\nupon these open and exposed marshes until they could fly; nesting and\\nthe beginning of the molt, including loss of the remiges, probably takes\\nplace in more sheltered localities.\\nFive specimens of white-cheeked geese were preserved, an adult\\nmale and adult female saved entire (nos. 39708-39709), and two males\\nand a female (nos. 39710-39712), of which head and neck only were\\npreserved.

In one case this bar is fairly well defined, though as each\\nseparate feather is narrowly edged with white and has a white base, a\\nmottled effect is produced. In three the black is not continuous, merely\\na string of disconnected black spots, and in one the white patch extends\\nuninterruptedly from cheek to cheek. Usually in the geese of this\\nregion there is either a string of disconnected spots, as in the specimens\\njust described, or else a beginning of such a line extending forward\\nand backward on the center of the throat but not meeting. Very rarely\\nthe black dividing line is continuous, broad, and well defined.

Fleming Grouse\\nIn summer, at least, this species is restricted to high altitudes in\\nthe mountains of the upper Stikine region. We met with it at but one\\npoint, at timber line, in the mountains above Doch-da-on Creek. A\\nfemale with a brood of small young was seen there, at about 4000 feet\\nelevation, on July 11.    On July 23, two broods were found near the-University of California Publications in Zoology     [Vol. 24\\nsame place, the young ones the size of mountain quail (Oreortyx),\\nstrong on the wing, and apparently well able to care for themselves.\\nOn July 11 a cock bird was flushed from the heather at the edge of a\\nsnow bank, far above the timber. Another was seen by Dixon at the\\nupper edge of the timber on Kirk's Mountain on July 17. No males\\nwere heard hooting at any time.\\nOf the two broods seen on July 23, one consisted of three young,\\nthe second of but one. These birds were found in open, grassy patches,\\nclose to dense and extensive thickets of prostrate balsam fir, that\\nafforded shelter from almost any enemy. The parent of the brood of\\nsmall young seen on July 11 was extremely solicitous for their safety.\\nShe was not aggressive in her solicitude, however, as is the ruffed\\ngrouse under similar circumstances, nor did she feign a broken wing\\nor other disability. She simply sat on the top of a thicket, obviously\\ngreatly worried, clucking nervously to the chicks until they had reached\\nwhat she considered a safe distance, when she followed after through\\nthe bushes. The larger young ones seen on July 23 were evidently expected to look after themselves to a great extent; they were as wary\\nand resourceful as their parents.\\nFive specimens were secured (nos. 39732-39736), two adult females\\nand a male and two females in juvenal plumage. These birds appear\\nto belong to the subspecies Dendragapus obscurus flemingi, described\\nby Taverner (1914, p. 385), from Teslin Lake, one hundred and forty\\nmiles north of the Stikine. This form is most nearly related to D. o.\\nrichardsoni; it is widely different from fuliginosus and sitkensis, the\\ncoastal subspecies. Richardsoni and flemingi are not \\\"hooters.\\\" The\\ncall note of the male bird is not the loud, far-reaching hoot that is so\\ncharacteristic of fuliginosus and sitkensis, and also of the California\\nrace, sierrae. In these latter subspecies the male bird has on each side\\nof the neck an area of bare skin that is brilliant yellow, greatly thickened, and- capable of wide distention, part of the hooting apparatus\\nand not highly developed in the non-hooting forms. (See Brooks,\\n1912, p. 252.) This is a structural difference of sufficient importance\\nto warrant the specific separation of these groups of grouse. Whether\\nor not D. o. obscurus of the southern Rocky Mountains is a hooter I\\ndo not know, and any changes of nomenclature would hinge upon this\\nfact.\\nFlemingi is described as differing from richardsoni in darker general coloration and in having the tail rounded, not truncate. Both are\\ndescribed as lacking a terminal tail band.   The general dark colora-1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n205\\ntion, including extension of dark areas and restriction of light ones, is\\nevident in the Stikine birds, as in topotypes of flemingi loaned me by\\nthe Victoria Memorial Museum, and is sufficiently marked to justify\\nthe recognition of flemingi. It is doubtful whether the tail characters\\nare valid. The sharply truncate tail of the male richardsoni is a feature that is not acquired until the second year at least. The young\\nmale, the first year, has the whole tail rounded, and the individual tail\\nfeathers are narrow and rounded as compared with the broad, truncate feathers of the old bird. Also, richardsoni can hardly be said\\nto lack entirely a terminal band on the tail. An indication, at least, of\\nthis marking is always present.\\nDendragapus obscurus sitkensis Swarth. Sitka Grouse\\nOn May 21, on the trip up the river from Wrangell, we stopped\\nat the Canadian custom house, just above the Alaska-British Columbia\\nboundary, and while anchored there heard a grouse hooting in the\\nnearby woods. Presumably this was the coast subspecies. The only\\nspecimen collected during the summer was an adult female (no. 39737)\\ntaken by Dixon at the southern end of Mitkof Island, during a three\\ndays' hunt for deer which he made to that point, August 26 to 29.

Valdez Spruce Grouse\\nFrom the reports we heard it is to be inferred that the spruce grouse\\nis of general distribution in the region we visited, and in fair abundance though locally restricted to suitable surroundings. We were informed that about Telegraph Creek this grouse was usually found in\\nthe spruce forests on the hillsides well up above the river valley. We,\\nourselves, met with the species at but two points. Late in the evening\\nof July 5, as we were returning to our camp at Glenora, a young spruce\\ngrouse flew up into a tree by the road and was taken. It was still\\npartly in the natal down, too young to be supposed to be shifting for\\nitself, but neither the parent nor any other of the brood was seen.\\nAt Flood Glacier an adult female and one chick were taken on\\nAugust 4, an adult male on August 7. No others were seen. These\\nbirds were collected in dense spruce woods, in the bottom lands between the river and the glacier. The old male was feeding on huckleberries.206\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you\\nHi\\nOf the specimens collected, the adult male (no. 39740, August 7)\\nhad virtually completed the annual molt. There are partly grown\\nfeathers over various parts, but the old plumage is all discarded. The\\nadult female (no. 39739, August 4) is still mostly in the worn, last\\nyear's plumage, though feather renewal is in progress in some tracts.\\nThe two young (no. 39741, male, Glenora, July 5; no. 39738, female,\\nFlood Glacier, August 4) are at precisely the same stage of development, though taken just a month apart. The natal down persists upon\\nhead, throat and belly, and the juvenal feathers clothe the back, breast,\\nflanks, and wings.\\nThe two adults are noticeably different from examples of Canachites\\nc. osgoodi from points in the interior. Of the latter I have had for\\ncomparison specimens from various points in northern British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska. Osgoodi, described from Lake Marsh, some\\n250 miles north of Telegraph Creek, is a grayish colored bird, compared with other races of C. canadensis, a character that becomes more\\nand more accentuated to the northward. Birds from the Kowak River\\nregion reach the extreme of differentiation in this regard (see Grinnell,\\n1900, p. 30). Our Flood Glacier adults are extremely dark colored,\\nmatching exactly examples of the coastal race, Canachites c. atratus,\\nfrom Prince William Sound, Alaska (Grinnell, 1910, p. 380). C. c.\\natratus was not admitted to the Check-List by the A. O. U. Committee\\n(1912, p. 385), its characters being deemed \\\"insufficient for recognition,\\\" but it seems to me to be a recognizable form. The inference\\nresulting from the capture of our Stikine birds is that that race of\\nspruce grouse will prove to be of continuous distribution in the coastal\\ndistrict between the Stikine River and Prince William Sound.\\nThe two young birds, from Glenora and Flood Glacier, respectively,\\nare somewhat different in appearance. The Glenora bird is more grayish in coloration, the Flood Glacier specimen more rufescent and with\\nmore extensive black areas upon individual feathers. These differences might pass unnoted, perhaps, were it not for the peculiarities of\\nthe Flood Glacier adults as compared with typical adult osgoodi. As\\nit is, I believe the observed differences in the juvenals to be of significance, for they are just the sort of differences that would be expected\\nto distinguish the young of atratus and osgoodi. The Glenora juvenal\\nmay be an example of Canachites c. osgoodi. This indicates the possible presence of two forms of Canachites canadensis in the Stikine\\nValley (as is the case with so many other species of birds), C. c. osgoodi\\nof the interior extending westward at least to Glenora, C. c. atratus\\nof the coast extending inland at least to Flood Glacier.1922\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        207\\nBonasa umbellus umbelloides (Douglas).   Gray Ruffed Grouse\\nFairly common in the poplar forests of the upper Stikine Valley.\\nWe ourselves saw none below Doch-da-on Creek, but the species undoubtedly ranges farther down stream, regularly. We were told of its\\noccasional occurrence at the mouth of the river, but whether breeding\\nor merely in winter I do not know.\\nDuring the first week in June single birds were several times seen\\nat the Junction. Three that were shot at this point were all males; the\\nfemales were undoubtedly sitting on eggs at that time. On June 12\\nthe first young were seen, two broods being encountered near Telegraph\\nCreek. The young of one brood were still unable to fly. Our first\\nknowledge of their presence was derived from the mother bird, who\\nburst forth from the bushes and charged us furiously. She kept tail\\nand ruff widely spread, the head crest depressed. She was mewling\\nin a very catlike fashion, and also hissing from time to time. There\\nwas an occasional faint peep from the grass nearby, and once I caught\\na glimpse of a yellow chick slipping away through the shrubbery, but\\nthe young were too agile to be captured.\\nThe young of the second brood were somewhat larger and able to\\nfly. This second mother tried to toll us away from the chicks by\\nfeigning a broken wing; the noise she made was not unlike the whining of a small puppy. Her actions, all together, gave the impression\\nthat she was frightened rather than angry. However, if frightened,\\nshe still did not desert her trust, but remained nearby, dragging herself back and forth across the road, with wings drooping and all her\\nfeathers pressed closely against her body. Her tail was not spread\\nnor were her ruffs displayed at any time, all in striking contrast to the\\nbehavior of the first bird met that morning.\\nFrom later observations it appeared that these two parents were\\nfairly typical of their kind in such an emergency. The mother either\\ncharged the intruder viciously, in an apparent attempt to frighten\\nhim, or else she endeavored to distract attention from the chicks to\\nherself by feigning injury and inviting pursuit. On one occasion the\\nparent of a brood came charging at me through the woods from a\\ndistance of fifty yards.\\nAt Doch-da-on Creek, July 8 to 26, ruffed grouse were seen on many\\noccasions. On July 15 an adult male was shot that proved to be in\\nthe midst of the molt; only one or two of the old rectrices were left and\\nthe body was covered with pin feathers. On July 18 the last drumming was heard.\\n11\\n'\\u25a0\\u25a0\\u25a0 \\u25a0\\u25a0!

Western Goshawk\\nGoshawks doubtless occur in summer throughout the region east of\\nthe coast ranges, but apparently in widely scattered pairs. We saw\\nthem at various localities, single individuals encountered at considerable intervals of time. At our camp at the Junction, the end of May,\\na recently dropped wing quill was evidence of the passage of one of\\nthe birds. One was seen flying overhead at the Summit, May 29, another at Glenora, July 7. On July 11 an adult male was shot at the\\nupper limit of timber (about 3000 feet altitude) on the mountain above\\nDoch-da-on Creek. On August 4 an immature female was taken at\\nFlood Glacier. This bird contained in its stomach the remains of a\\nred squirrel.\\nThe adult male collected (no. 39756) is referable to the eastern\\nsubspecies, Astur atricapillus atricapillus, and is, I assume, representative of the form that inhabits the entire region east of the coast ranges.\\nThe young bird taken at Flood Glacier (no. 39757) may or may not\\nhave been hatched in that immediate neighborhood. No other goshawks were seen there, and other species of hawks (pigeon hawks and\\nsharp-shinned hawks) were at that time beginning to appear, apparently migrating. At any rate, this individual appears to be an example of the western subspecies, A. a. striatulus. It is closely matched\\nby four young of striatulus from their nesting ground in the Warner\\nMountains, California, and it is quite unlike a series of six immatures\\nof atricapillus from the Yukon region.

Then, at Flood Glacier, a family of extremely\\nlight colored individuals was encountered. On July 26, and on subsequent days, an adult red-tail was several times seen from our camp,\\nsometimes perched in a tall spruce, sometimes flying past. The breast\\nand belly of this bird appeared to be gleaming white, and the back\\nseemed to have much white spotting.\\nOn July 31 Dixon found this adult feeding two full-grown young\\nones in an opening in the forest; though the parent was too wary to\\nbe captured, he took both the immatures. These, like the old one, are\\nextremely light colored. Chin, throat and breast are continuously\\nwhite, the breast with a buffy suffusion, and the lower abdomen and\\nlower tail coverts are white. In the spotted tract across the middle of\\nthe body below, and on the flanks, the dark spots are relatively small\\nand separated by wide areas of white. The area immediately surrounding the eye, and between eye and bill, is white. In the feathers\\non the top of head and back of neck are small central spots of black\\nor dusky, and extensive basal and marginal areas of white. Over the\\nentire upperparts the feathers are extensively white spotted and with\\nbroad margins of white or pale buffy.\\nIn a large series of young calurus from various parts of the western\\nUnited States we have nothing at all like these birds. An immature\\nmale borealis from Wisconsin is like the Stikine River specimens in the\\nuniformly white chin, throat, and breast, and in the restriction of the\\nblack spots below, but it is not so white on the head and upperparts.\\nButeo borealis krideri has been recorded from Alaska on the basis of\\na light colored bird taken at Eagle during the winter of 1903 (B. H.\\nBailey, 1916, p. 321). The red-tails, however, form a puzzling aggregation of geographical races and color phases, and it does not simplify\\nmatters in this case to assign to the subspecies krideri a range covering\\npart of the habitat of calurus. The present writer is disinclined to\\nregard the light colored birds just described as examples of krideri,\\nthereby extending the range of that form far to the westward. Most\\nof the red-tails seen throughout the Stikine region were of the recognized calurus type.    Until the meaning of   the diverse phases of1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        213\\nplumage seen is thoroughly understood it is safer to regard all the\\nbirds of that part of the country as of the one subspecies, calurus.\\nOf the two young birds collected, the female had crop and stomach\\nfilled to distention. In the partly digested mass there could be distinguished the remains of at least four mice and one toad. The mice\\ncould be identified as Microtus mordax. The male bird had its stomach\\nfilled with a mass of Microtus bones and hair. The meadow mice that\\nthe young hawks had eaten must all have been fed to them by their\\nparents. While Microtus mordax was a fairly common species at that\\npoint, still it is noteworthy that a red-tailed hawk should be sufficiently\\nagile to catch so many of them in as short a space of time as must have\\nbeen the case. The mice in the river bottom, where the hawks were\\nfound, were in cover so dense that it was surprising to find a red-\\ntail there at all. The hunting of the latter, may of course, have been\\ndone on the nearby mountain sides, above the denser timber, but even\\nso it seems rather remarkable that they should find so little difficulty\\nin catching these small rodents.\\nMm\\nButeo swainsoni Bonaparte.

In either case the slight modification of the clear white breast of montieola produced by the humid\\nsurroundings would result in an apparent intergrade toward harrisi.\\nIn this connection it may be remarked that the highly distinctive\\navifauna of the southeastern Alaskan coast is, for the most part, composed of species that occur on the Pacific coast farther south and\\nextend northward along a narrow coastal strip, more or less modified\\nin appearance. Most of these birds extend farther north than does the\\nhairy woodpecker of the same region. Cyanocitta stelleri, Penthestes\\nrufescens, Junco oreganus, and the coastal forms of Melospiza melodia\\nare all birds of this type, and they all occur farther north than does\\nDryobates villosus sitkensis.\\nThe latter apparently belongs to ah aggregation of bird species\\nthat has more recently invaded the coast from the eastward along a\\nfew favorable avenues of approach. The northern limit reached in\\nsuch cases would be governed by the chance terminus of the route that\\nhappened to open up from the eastward, with, of course, later extension from the new base. Other species in this same category are:\\nDryobates pubesce/ns, Piranga ludoviciana, Bombycilia cedrorum,\\nEmpidonax trailli, and perhaps Geothlypis trichas. These birds are\\nfor the most part not nearly so abundant in the coastal region, nor\\nare they so evenly distributed, as species of the first category listed.\\nFourteen specimens of Dryobates villosus montieola were collected\\n(nos. 39766-39779), eleven adults and three young. Twelve are from\\nTelegraph Creek, one from Doch-da-on Creek, and one from Flood\\nGlacier.\\nSphyrapicus varius varius (Linnaeus). Yellow-bellied Sapsucker\\nOn June 18 an adult male was taken. Immediately after this bird\\nwas shot its mate appeared and disclosed the location of the nest. On\\nJune 19 another male bird was taken within half a mile of where the\\nfirst was shot. This was about five miles from Telegraph Creek. The\\nnest referred to was twenty-five feet from the ground, in a dead birch'\\u00ab*:>\\n19221 Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        219\\nin rather open woods. The cavity appeared to be newly finished, and\\nwas empty. The two birds at the nest drew attention to their presence\\nby their raucous call notes, screams worthy of a large hawk. The\\nsecond specimen collected was traced through his noisy drumming upon\\na dead limb.\\nThese three sapsuckers were the only ones that were seen near\\nTelegraph Creek. The first one obtained (no. 39780) is close to typical\\nvarius. It has no red on the nape, and the red chin and throat patch\\nis separated from the white subauricular stripe by a strip of black,\\nthese characters being just as in varius. It has less white on the back\\nthan most eastern examples of varius, but there is one specimen available from\\\" Illinois that resembles it closely. Taken by itself, this specimen would pass unquestioned as an example of varius. The mate of\\nthis bird was not obtained, but it was seen for a brief moment close\\nenough to note that it had a great deal of red about the head, almost\\nobliterating the black pectoral patch. The one collected on June 19\\n(no. 39781) has the red nuchal stripe, and the red of the chin and\\nthroat has obliterated the black malar stripe, invaded the white sub-\\nauricular stripe beyond, and covers the entire black pectoral patch.\\nIn the latter marking the black feathers are tipped with red; the\\nposterior border of this patch is sharply defined against the-whitish\\nbelly. The dorsal region is but scantily spotted with white. It is just\\nsuch a specimen as, taken in winter in California, would be defined\\nas an example of nuchalis showing a decided leaning toward ruber.\\nRidgway (1914) regards varius and ruber as specifically distinct.\\nIn the upper Stikine Valley the two forms do appear to meet as separate species, but intergradation through individual variation occurs\\nelsewhere and by that criterion the two should be regarded as subspecies\\nof one species. A parallel case in the Stikine region is found in the\\nthrushes, Hylocichla ustulata ustulata and H. u. swainsoni. The facts\\nderived from our specimens of Sphyrapicus are as follows: At Telegraph Creek we took one typical example of varius, and one bird that\\nhas more the appearance of a hybrid between two species (varius and\\nruber) than an \\\"intergrade\\\" between two such forms, regarded as\\nsubspecies. At Doch-da-on Creek, some fifty miles down the river, we\\ncollected specimens of ruber, specimens absolutely typical of that form\\n(see postea, p. 220). We have here no series of intergrades, difficult of\\nallocation and from an intermediate region. There are instead examples of two extremes, varius and ruber, nesting within a short distance of each other.

These trees showed large areas of scars, the\\nresults of assiduous work by the sapsuckers for a considerable period\\nof time.\\nThe five birds taken are typical examples of the dark colored northern race of the red-breasted sapsucker (Sphyrapicus v. ruber). This\\nlocality, Doch-da-on Creek, may be regarded as the easternmost limit\\nof ruber in this region, yet the race persists in typical form to this\\nextreme boundary. There is no indication of intergradation with\\nvarius or nuchalis at this margin of its habitat, such as might be expected to occur. The relationships of the three forms, varius, nuchalis,\\nand ruber, present an unsolved problem, whether we regard them as\\nspecies or subspecies. As between ruber and daggetti, however, there\\nis gradual intergradation exhibited by specimens from intermediate\\npoints, such as we are accustomed to see in most geographic races, or\\nsubspecies.\\nColaptes auratus borealis Ridgway. Boreal Flicker\\nFairly common in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, but so shy and\\nwary as readily to elude observation.

The species was about as numerous at\\nGlenora; at Doch-da-on Creek it occurred in lesser numbers. None\\nwas seen farther down the river.\\nThree sets of eggs were taken (nos. 1807-1809). On June 20, a\\nsingle fresh egg, an incomplete set, was found near Telegraph Creek,\\nlaid on the bare ground in open woods.. The female, shot before the\\negg was found, contained a second egg, nearly ready to be laid. A\\nset of two eggs, slightly incubated, was taken June 26 in the same\\ntract of woods. This was an area that had been burned over, leaving\\na scattering growth of small lodgepole pines, with but little underbrush between. A third set was collected at Doch-da-on Creek, July 18.\\nThese were incubated within a few days of hatching. The eggs were\\nplaced on the bare ground in an open place in the woods. On all sides,\\nsome thirty or forty yards distant, there was dense brush, but the\\nground was open in the immediate vicinity of the eggs.\\n2 Por the use of this name for the northwestern flicker, see Palmer, 1916, p. 322.222\\n-:3!\\nIBfil:\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\nThe parent of the second set was extremely solicitous of their safety.\\nShe flew as we approached, coming toward us with a peculiarly halting\\nand uncertain flight, with her tail depressed until it pointed almost\\nstraight down, and with her mouth open. Alighting near-by, she\\nwallowed on the ground, thus luring us in pursuit for about twenty or\\nthirty yards, then flew off in a circle through the woods. The parent\\nof the set at Doch-da-on Creek acted quite differently. She left the\\neggs while the intruder was still some distance away, departing quietly\\nand without any manifestations of solicitude. In just twenty minutes\\nshe returned, -as secretively as she had left. This course of action was\\nfollowed without variation on three different occasions.\\nFour specimens were collected (nos. 39790-39793), two adult males\\nand two adult females.

Black Swift\\nA few seen about six miles from Telegraph Creek on June 12,\\ncircling overhead just out of gun shot. From this circumstance the\\nspecies may be assumed to breed somewhere in that general region.\\nOne or two were observed at Glenora early in July. The next place\\nthe species was noted was at Great Glacier, where, on the morning of\\nAugust 9, a flock of fifteen or more was seen.\\nAt Sergief Island, August 17 to September 7, black swifts were\\nabundant, though seen only in cloudy or rainy weather. Then large\\nflocks appeared, as many as seventy-five or a hundred being in sight\\nat once flying over the marshes, the individuals moving about in wide\\ncircles, and the flock as a whole moving in a definite path. The birds\\nsometimes flew very low, occasionally skimming along just over the\\ntall grass. A flock would appear, circle about overhead awhile, and\\nthen vanish. About fifteen or twenty minutes later, others, or perhaps\\nthe same flock, would come in sight again.\\nCompared with Aeronautes and Chaetura, the flight of Cypseloides\\n(at least as seen thus feeding) is rather slow, a steady sailing with\\nrelatively little fluttering of the wings. A high rate of speed can be\\nattained, however, so great that when individuals passed by in pursuit\\nof one. another the rush of their wings could be heard to a distance of\\ntwo hundred yards or more. A weak, chattering note was uttered\\nfrom time to time, but mostly the birds were silent.\\nSeventeen specimens were obtained at Sergief Island (nos. 39794-\\n39810), five males and twelve females.   It might be supposed that ato\\npMj\\n19221\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n223\\nseries of specimens taken when these birds were collected (August\\n19-30), would contain a large percentage of immatures, but if such\\nyoung birds are included in the lot they possessed no features, either\\nof internal anatomy or external coloration that enabled me definitely\\nto recognize them as such. According to Drew (1882, p. 182) the\\nyoung of this species is appreciably different from the adult in coloration, the dark feathers being extensively white-tipped, both above and\\nbelow. Of the five males, two have extremely faint light colored tips\\nto the feathers of the lower abdomen and on the lower tail coverts.\\nOne of the five has the tail very slightly forked, in the others it is\\ndeeply indented. Of the twelve females, one is uniformly dark colored;\\nit has no trace of any whitish tips to the feathers of the lower parts.\\nIn the others such markings are present in varying degrees. The dark\\ncolored female has a truncate tail, just as do the, others. In every\\nindividual, both male and female, the sexual organs were clearly visible.\\nThey were shrunken in size, as would be expected in adults at that\\nseason, but they were never difficult to see, as is so often the case with\\nyoung birds. The birds collected had entirely finished the annual\\nmolt and were all in the new plumage.\\nChaetura vauxi (J. K. Townsend). Vaux Swift\\nOn June 26 a single bird was noted some five miles from Telegraph\\nCreek. At Doch-da-on Creek, the middle of July, a few were seen on\\nseveral different days. At Flood Glacier, August 3 and 5, several were\\nobserved, flying low in the rain that was falling, and all traveling down\\nstream.\\nTwo specimens were collected (nos. 39811, 39812), an adult male\\nand an adult female, taken at Doch-da-on Creek, on July 16 and 14,\\nrespectively.\\nSelasphorus rufus (Gmelin). Rufous Hummingbird\\nSeen at every collecting station, but nowhere in abundance. The\\nspecies was at Telegraph Creek at the. time of our arrival, May 23;\\nat that time it was restricted to the near vicinity of the river, where\\nthere were already some flowers in bloom. On the higher slopes the\\nvegetation was not so far advanced, and the hummingbirds were absent.\\nA nest found at Doch-da-on Creek, July 10, was in a clump of large\\ntimber, built near the tip of a spruce limb, about five feet from the\\nground.    The outer surface of the structure was well covered with\\n111\\nHI224\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol. 24\\nlichens. Attention was drawn to this nest by the sudden flight of the\\ntwo young birds it contained, when approached too closely.\\nDuring the second week in July a female hummingbird was repeatedly seen in the vicinity of our camp. On the 14th a male bird\\nwas seen going through his courtship flight, associated with this same\\nfemale, so nesting may have been going on at that date. In the courting flight the male bird rose slowly to a height of about sixty feet, then\\nswooped down and swung up again for a very short distance. A\\ndiagram showing the course of this evolution would be about the shape\\nof a fishhook. When the lowest point was reached, three or four rasping notes were uttered. The evolution finished, he slowly arose' once\\nmore and repeated the performance. This was done five or six times,\\nwhen he lit on a nearby limb.\\nFor a hummingbird to appear as a menace to a farm crop was a\\nnew role for a member of that family, but we heard one such complaint\\nof damage done. Mr. W. E. Parrott, of Sergief Island, had a large\\nstrawberry patch, the fruit of which he marketed in the nearby town\\nof Wrangell. Time and again, so he told us, he had seen a hummingbird dash at one of the bright red berries, apparently under the impression that it was a flower, and the bird's bill would be thrust through\\nthe fruit, which, of course, was ruined. He had found a number of\\nberries pierced in this way, and was puzzled to account for the damage\\nuntil he saw a hummingbird in the act.\\nTwo specimens were preserved (nos. 39813, 39814). These are\\nadult males taken at Glenora, June 29 and July 3, respectively.\\nSayornis sayus (Bonaparte). Say Phoebe\\nSeveral pairs seen on the upper Stikine River. At Telegraph\\nCreek at least two pairs were domiciled on different houses in the town.\\nOn June 6, one pair was seen at work nest building on a beam over the\\nentrance to Hyland's store. At Glenora, June 29, a nest with young\\nwas found in one of the deserted houses of the Hudson's Bay Company. A day or two later the birds were gone and search of the adjoining fields failed to disclose their presence; evidently the brood had at\\nonce traveled some distance.\\nOn August 21 an immature female was collected on Sergief Island,\\nperched on some drift far out on the marshes. This, I believe, is the\\nfirst time the species has been reported from the coast of southeastern\\nAlaska. It is, of course, a transient, perhaps no more than a straggler\\ninto that region. The bird collected on Sergief Island had probably\\nwandered there from the interior along the Stikine River.1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        225\\nSayornis sayus yukonensis was described by Bishop (19006, p. 115)\\nfrom Glacier, White Pass, Alaska, as a northern form, differing from\\nS. sayus sayus in darker coloration and in certain structural details.\\nThe subspecies was denied recognition by the A. 0. U. Committee\\n(1901, p. 312), nor has it been generally recognized since that time.\\nGrinnell (1909a,, p. 206) uses the name S. s. yukonensis for a specimen\\nfrom Forty-Mile, Yukon, which is shown to exhibit the characters\\nclaimed for the race by Bishop. The young bird (no. 39815) collected\\nby myself differs appreciably from juvenals from the southwest. It is\\nof darker coloration and has much less rufous on the upperparts, thus\\nagreeing with Bishop's (loc. cit.) description of the juvenal plumage\\nof yukonensis. Thus the two northern specimens of Sayornis sayus in\\nthis Museum are of a character to justify the recognition of S. s.\\nyukonensis, but the material is so scanty that, rather than formally\\naffix that name to these two individuals, I prefer to let the description of their peculiarities rest as evidence for use at some future time\\nwhen additional material has been acquired.\\nNuttallornis borealis. (Swainson). Olive-sided Flycatcher\\nThere were a few pairs in the more open wooded country about\\nTelegraph Creek.

They were partial to more sparsely\\nwooded areas, especially burnt-over tracts, where they perched upon\\ndead trees affording a wide outlook. In such places they could seldom\\nbe approached to within a hundred yards.\\nThree specimens collected (nos. 39816-39818), one adult male and\\ntwo adult females.

The birds could be heard calling, and occasionally\\none could be seen in flight through the bushes, but their habitat was\\nso impenetrable and the birds were so shy and wary that they were\\nalmost impossible to approach.\\nAfter leaving Doch-da-on Creek the alder flycatcher was seen on\\nbut one occasion. On Sergief Island, September 3, an immature\\nfemale was collected in a tangle of alders.

Near Telegraph Creek many were seen during the last1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        227\\nweek in'May, usually sitting high up in the leafless poplars and conspicuous from their frequently reiterated, sharp che-bec. Like the\\nother small flycatchers of the region, they were extremely shy, but,\\nthrough peculiarities of habit and habitat, Hammond flycatchers were\\nmore easily collected than some of the other species. The olive-sided\\nflycatcher and wood pewee, perched upon isolated lookout points, could\\nnot- be approached unawares. The alder flycatcher was in tangled\\nthickets not to be penetrated save with much labor and with the accompaniment of threshing branches and broken boughs. The Hammond flycatcher was mostly in woods that could be traversed with fair\\nease, but which yet afforded some cover to the hunter.\\nThe species was quite abundant at Telegraph Creek and at Glenora,\\nand in lesser numbers at Doch-da-on Creek. Several were seen at\\nFlood Glacier, though whether the species breeds at that point we had\\nno means of telling.   One was collected at Great Glacier, August 10.\\nA female shot near Telegraph Creek, May 27, was incubating a set\\nof eggs. One collected June 1 had laid part of its set. An adult male\\ntaken at Glenora, June 30, shows the beginning of the molt. An\\nadult female from Flood Glacier, July 27, had renewed a large part of\\nits plumage. Two specimens in juvenal plumage were taken at Flood\\nGlacier, August 3 and 6. A young bird from Great Glacier, August\\n10, shows the beginning of the molt into the first winter plumage.\\nIt is strange that the Hammond flycatcher has not yet been found\\non the coast of southeastern Alaska south of Skagway. It is abundant\\nin the interior and approaches the coast quite nearly at some points.\\nIt is also abundant in the coastal region farther south, as on Vancouver\\nIsland.

Pallid Horned Lark\\nSeen in small numbers on the mountain tops above Doch-da-on\\nCreek. There, on July 11 and again on July 23, they were found on the\\nopen, moss-covered slopes above timber line, associated with rosy\\nfinches and pipits. This station is, in a straight line, not more than\\nsixty miles from the coast, farther to the westward than horned larks\\nhave been found in this region heretofore. From the mountain we\\nwere on, however, we could see many similar peaks and ridges far to\\nthe westward, where the species would probably be found could these\\nsummits be reached. These mountains are so steep and rough, with\\nsuch impenetrable forests at the lower levels, and, toward the coast, so\\nfrequently encircled by glaciers, that their ascent at most places is\\nextremely difficult. Horned larks may well occur at favorable points\\nbut a few miles back from the coast, but the circumstances are such\\nthat it is doubtful if this possible habitat will soon be invaded by any\\ncollector.\\nWe collected four specimens (nos. 39835-39838), two adult males,\\none adult female, and one juvenal male. The two adult males, taken\\nJuly 23, are beginning the annual molt, shown mostly in the wing\\ncoverts. The young bird, taken July 23, is in juvenal plumage throughout. Compared with the young of various of the southwestern subspecies of Otocoris alpestris, it is extremely dark colored. Ground\\ncolor of the upper parts is blackish, throat and lower belly are white,\\nand there is hardly a trace of rufous or vinaceous anywhere.1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Reg\\nton\\n229\\nCyanocitta stelleri stelleri (Gmelin). Steller Jay\\nClosely restricted to the coastal region. On our way down stream\\nwe saw the first Steller jay at Flood Glacier, some forty miles up the\\nriver from the boundary.

The species is sufficiently conspicuous and noisy to\\ndraw attention to itself when present, and as the above records constitute all of our observations on the upper river, it is obvious that this\\njay is of relatively uncommon occurrence in that region.\\nAt Sergief Island many were seen, sometimes under circumstances\\nsuggesting migration. They were frequently in small gatherings,\\nseven or eight together, and often on the tidal marshes, far from timber,\\napparently traveling in a definite direction. When thus seen they\\nwere flying by easy stages from one drift log to another, in a southerly\\ndirection.\\nAn adult female (no. 39839) taken at Flood Glacier, August 1,\\nis in the midst of the annual molt.

Two immatures from Sergief Island (nos. 39842, 39843)\\nobtained on August 23 and 31, respectively, are likewise through the\\nmolt, and have fully acquired their first winter plumage. These birds\\nare all typical stelleri. Those taken the farthest inland evidently represent extreme points of dispersal from the coast.

Family groups, old and young\\ntogether, were seen at several points between Telegraph Creek and\\nthe Summit, and single individuals were occasionally encountered\\nslipping quietly through the woods.\\nThis jay was one of several species that appeared to be restricted\\nduring the breeding season to a higher zone than that immediately\\nbordering the Stikine River. None was seen nearer the river than\\nThe Junction, a point four miles north of Telegraph Creek, several\\n\\u25a0 \\u00bb\\u2022,230\\nUniversity of Califorma Publications in Zoology     you 24\\n\\u25a0\\u25a0    m?\\nmi um\\nfill\\nhundred feet higher in altitude, and about two weeks later in the\\ndevelopment of the vegetation. On June 4 at the Summit, a gathering\\nof jays was encountered composed of at least two broods. The old\\nbirds were busily engaged in feeding the young, though the latter were\\nalso foraging a little for themselves.\\nWe did not see the species either at Glenora or Doch-da-on Creek,\\nbut it can hardly be doubted that it occurs at both places. There was\\nat least one brood in the woods about our camp at Flood Glacier. The\\nforest at that point is not of the type most favored by this species,\\nbeing almost entirely dense spruce woods such as are seen along the\\ncoast, and it is questionable whether the occurrence there of this\\nfamily of Perisoreus can be assumed to represent a breeding record.\\nNone was seen farther down the river.\\nIndividuals taken the last week in May and the first week in June\\nhad in several cases already begun the annual molt. Two adults taken\\nat Flood Glacier on July 28 were in the midst of this molt. Two\\nyoung birds taken at the same place July 28 and August 6 are molting\\nfrom the juvenal into the first winter plumage.\\nThere have been available for comparison a series of adult Peri-\\nsoreu,s canadensis canadensis from Minnesota, and old and young of\\nP. c. fumifrons from the Kotzebue Sound and Yukon River regions,\\nAlaska. The Stikine River adults are similar to fumifrons in general\\nbody color, but have more white on the crown. They resemble\\ncanadensis in head markings but are rather darker colored. The\\nyoung birds from the Stikine region are distinctly darker colored, more\\nof a slaty black, as compared with the juvenals from Kotzebue Sound\\nand the Yukon River. This dark type of coloration is a character\\nascribed to the young of P. c. canadensis by Ridgway (1904, p. 366).\\nOn the whole, the Stikine River series may be assigned to the subspecies Perisoreus canadensis canadensis, though showing a tendency\\ntoward P. c. fumifrons.'\\nWe collected thirteen specimens of the Canada jay (nos. 39844-\\n39856), five adults and four juvenals from points within twelve miles\\nof Telegraph Creek, and two adults and two juvenals from Flood\\nGlacier.\\nCorvus corax principalis Ridgway.   Northern Raven\\nProbably occurs throughout this whole region, but, judging from\\nour observations, not abundant at any point.   We were at Telegraph\\nCreek three weeks before we saw one.   The first was noted on June 17,\\nand afterwards others were seen on several occasions.   At Doch-da-on1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        231\\nCreek ravens were occasionally observed, and at Great Glacier several\\nwere seen. There were a few at Sergief Island, seen from time to\\ntime, or heard croaking in the distance.\\nCorvus brachyrhynchos caurinus Baird. Northwest Crow\\nSeen only at Sergief Island. Here, during the latter part of August\\nand the first week in September, crows were fairly abundant, usually\\nin small flocks. Young birds were still being cared for by their parents,\\nand the gatherings seen were apparently family groups, though sometimes two broods may have joined forces. This bird is strictly a\\n\\\"beach comber,\\\" apparently not venturing inland any distance whatever. We saw none above the mouth of the river. No specimens were\\ntaken. This form appears in the A. 0. U. Check-List as a distinct\\nspecies, but it should be regarded as a subspecies of Corvxis brachyrhynchos (cf. Rhoads, 1893, pp. 18-21; Ridgway, 1904, p. 272; Oberholser, 1919a, p. 84).\\nEuphagus carolinus (Miiller). Rusty Blackbird\\nBreeding in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek. There were, several\\npairs nesting about Sawmill Lake, at different points, not in any one\\ngathering or colony. A female shot June 11 was incubating eggs.\\nAt Doch-da-on Creek the species was seen about some swampy meadows\\nand lakes during the latter part of July, when young birds, full grown,\\nthough still in the juvenal plumage throughout, were being cared for\\nby their parents. The young sat in the willows, while the adults were\\nforaging through the swamps for the food that was hurried back to the\\nsqualling youngsters as rapidly as it was found.\\nSeen at one other collecting station. On Sergief Island, September\\n5, a single bird passed over my head, out of gun shot, while I was out\\non the marsh.\\nTen specimens collected (nos. 39857-39866), an adult male and\\nfemale from Telegraph Creek, and eight in juvenal plumage from\\nDoch-da-on Creek.

The young male is much more\\nblack beneath the prevailing rusty or yellowish hue of the feather tips.\\nPinicola enucleator fiammula Homeyer.

Another was noted some five miles west of Telegraph Creek,\\nJune 12. At Doch-da-on Creek, a mated pair was taken July 9, apparently preparing to nest. On July 17, at the same place, a flock of seven\\nor eight was encountered, feeding near the ground in some thick\\nbushes; on July 14 a brilliant red male was seen; on July 22 a dull-\\ncolored male was secured. The last mentioned was in full song; it\\nwas beyond doubt a breeding bird. On August 2, at Flood Glacier, a\\nred male was seen singing in a tree top near camp.\\nFive specimens collected (nos. 39867-39871), two adult males from\\nThe Junction, May 29 and 31; the mated pair from Doch-da-on Creek,\\nJuly 9 (the male in the female plumage) ; a dull-colored male from\\nDoch-da-on Creek, July 22. These were identified as Pinicola enu-\\ncleator flammula by Dr. H. C. Oberholser, of the United States Biological Survey.\\nCarpodacus purpureus purpureus (Gmelin). Eastern Purple Finch\\nWe had collected during most of the month of June in the vicinity\\nof Telegraph Creek without once encountering this species. Then on\\nJuly 5, in a section we had previously worked most thoroughly about\\na mile from Telegraph Creek, we encountered several small flocks of\\npurple finches. Three were taken (nos. 39872-39874), a male and two\\nfemales, all birds that apparently were just through breeding. The\\nmale is in the streaked female plumage, with just one pink feather on\\nthe breast.   Both females show some reddish on the rump.\\nThese birds are unequivocally of the subspecies purpureus, and\\ntheir capture at this point constitutes, I believe, a material extension\\nof range northwestward. The species probably breeds somewhere\\nwithin a few miles of where the birds were collected.\\nLoxia curvirostra bendirei Ridgway. Bendire Crossbill\\nDuring the latter part of June a few red crossbills were seen flying\\noverhead in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek. On June 22 a' small\\nflock was encountered, apparently a single family, and four birds were\\ncollected (nos. 39876-39879), an adult male and three juvenals. It\\nis of interest to note that these birds are of the subspecies bendirei,\\nwidely different in appearance from the form inhabiting the nearby\\ncoastal region of Alaska. This would indicate that the range of the\\nsmall sized, red crossbill of the Pacific slope of British Columbia and1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n233\\nsoutheastern Alaska is entirely cut off from that of Loxia curvirostra\\nminor of eastern North America through the interven^jm of the form\\nbendirei. The Alaskan bird has been named Loxia curvirostra sitkensis\\nby Grinnell (19096, p. 223), based largely on color characters in the\\nadult male. Birds from Vancouver Island do not exhibit the same\\nsort of differentiation from minor, in fact to my eye they are indistinguishable. Nevertheless it seems evident that the Vancouver Island\\nbirds also occupy part of the territory that is separated from minor\\nby the habitat of bendirei. The proper nomenelatural treatment of\\nsuch a form as the Vancouver Island race of Loxia curvirostra is an\\nopen question. It seems evident that genetically it is as far from\\nminor as is bendirei; yet, since the birds from the Pacific and Atlantic\\nregions are indistinguishable in appearance, we call them all by the\\nsame name.\\nThe characters ascribed to L. c. bendirei by Ridgway (1901, p. 50)\\nare as follows: \\\"Similar to L. c. minor, but decidedly larger; adult\\nmale averaging rather lighter or brighter in color, the adult female\\nslightly lighter and grayer.\\\" These characters are well borne out by\\nthe specimens of bendirei in the collection of this museum. In addition, the young birds from Telegraph Creek, all in the streaked juvenal\\nplumage, exhibit well defined features of size and color. They are\\nappreciably larger than comparable examples of sitkensis and minor,\\nand are grayish toned. Juvenals of the small coastal race are much\\nmore greenish and olivaceous in general body color.\\nIII\\nli\\nI\\nLoxia curvirostra sitkensis Grinnell. Sitka Crossbill\\nOn Sergief Island, during August and September, a few red crossbills were seen at various times. On August 28 an adult female was\\ncollected (no. 39875). This bird was evidently incubating a set of\\neggs, judging from the bare breast and the condition of the oviduct.\\nIt seems curious that nesting should have been going on at that season,\\nwhen we had taken full-grown juvenals of bendirei at Telegraph Creek\\nin June.\\n\\u2022\\u2022\\u25a0\\u25a0:\\u25a0\\n;li!

During the first three weeks\\nin July flocks were seen daily, in rapidly increasing numbers.   Then,234 University of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol, 24\\n!\\u25a0    \\u25a0.':\\u25a0\\u25a0!\\u2022> *\\nm\\\\\\\\m\\nH'l 111\\nat Doch-da-on Creek, July 21, a male bird was shot that was one of a\\npair. Several pairs were seen there subsequently, and the flocks appeared to be breaking up. At Flood Glacier, July 26 to August 8,\\nthe species was present in great numbers, and breeding. No nests\\nwere discovered, but several females were shot that had laid parts of\\ntheir sets. The birds were fairly numerous at Great Glacier, August\\n9 to 16, several were seen about the custom house at the boundary,\\nAugust 16, and they were frequently observed at Sergief Island up to\\nthe time of our departure.\\nIt was a surprise to me to find this crossbill nesting so late in the\\nsummer. That this is not the invariable custom of the species is shown\\nby Grinnell's (1900, p. 45) account of their habits in the Kotzebue\\nSound region, where eggs were found in May. Their actions in the\\nStikine country may have been influenced by food conditions, for in\\n1919 throughout the region there was a tremendous crop of spruce\\ncones, which were ripening at the time of the appearance of these birds.\\nAt Glenora the crossbills were feeding on the seed pods of the\\ncottonwoods, as they were also in some degree at Doch-da-on Creek,\\nbut farther down the river, and a little later in the season, the spruce\\ncones had their undivided attention.\\nThe song of the white-winged crossbill was one of the most notable\\nfeatures of the bird life of the Stikine Valley. As the flocks broke up,\\nthe male birds sang more and more. During our stay at Flood Glacier\\nthey were at the height of their efforts, and the music was in our ears\\nat all times. It was a continuous, rollicking, trilling song, lasting for\\nminutes at a time without cessation, and loud enough to be heard several hundred yards. The singer was usually on some high perch,\\npreferably the dead top of a tall spruce; frequently he would fling\\nhimself into the air on wide extended, slow beating wings, singing as\\nhe went, flying sixty or seventy yards, perhaps, to another perch. The\\nsong is somewhat suggestive of that of a caged canary; we also found\\nit reminiscent of that of the California house finch (Carpodacus mexi-\\ncanus frontalis). The song-flight especially is suggestive of a similar\\nspring performance of the house finch.\\nNine specimens collected (nos. 39880-39888), four adult males and\\nfive adult females, two from Glenora, two from Doch-da-on Creek, and\\nfive from Flood Glacier.1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        235\\nLeucosticte tephrocotis littoralis Baird.   Hepburn Rosy Finch\\nMet with at but one locality, on the mountain tops above Doch-da-on\\nCreek. We made two trips to the higher ridges above timber line, and\\nsaw rosy finches in some numbers each time. They appeared in view\\nsoon after we emerged from the upper edge of the forest (about 3500\\nfeet) and they evidently inhabited all of the open country from there\\non upward. Upon our first visit to their territory (July 11) not many\\nof the birds were seen, and they were mostly drifting about through\\nthe air by twos and threes, as horned larks do at times.\\nThe next time we climbed the mountain, on July 23, we found\\nthem in much greater numbers. Just at the upper edge of the timber\\na flock of twenty or thirty was encountered, feeding in \\u2022tall dry grass\\nthat had grown up in an area previously swept by fire. Many dead\\ntrees stood on this slope, and the rosy finches when startled flew to the\\ntree tops. This entire flock was of adult birds; two males were collected, and my impression was that they were all males, beginning to\\nflock together after the nesting season. A little farther on females\\nand young were found, mostly near extensive snow banks. The young\\nwere all in juvenal plumage and were not quite full grown; that is,\\nwing and tail feathers had not reached their full length. The old\\nbirds were assiduously feeding the young, and in the pursuit of this\\nduty we several times saw them fly into the air to capture flying insects,\\nwhich were then carried to the waiting offspring.\\nTwenty-one specimens collected, all taken July 23 (nos. 39889-\\n39909), four adult males, seven adult females, six juvenal males, three\\njuvenal females, and one juvenal with sex not ascertained.\\nThe adults are all in worn breeding plumage, though the feathers\\nare not so ragged as might be expected. Some are just beginning the\\nannual molt. The main plumage variation concerns the gray coloration\\non chin and throat. In some the brown of the breast extends well up\\non the chin, in others there are scattered gray feathers extending\\ndownward from the throat on to the breast. The juvenals, as compared with the similar stage in Leucosticte tephrocotis dawsoni from\\nthe Sierras of California, are noticeably dark colored throughout.\\nThe gullets and stomachs were preserved of sixteen birds, all that\\ncontained any food.

Pine Siskin\\nFairly common throughout the whole region traversed, and seen\\nin flocks during the entire nesting season. At Telegraph Creek birds\\nwere seen carrying building material during the first week of June,\\nand on June 20 a set of three eggs was taken. The extensive open\\nfields at Glenora were thickly grown up with dandelions when we arrived there at the end of June, and the siskins were present in large\\nflocks, feeding upon the dandelion seeds. At the same place they were\\nseen about the log cabins picking at the plaster between the logs.\\nAt Doch-da-on Creek, at Flood Glacier, and at Great Glacier, siskins\\nwere encountered daily, usually in small flocks. During our brief stop\\nat the boundary, August 16, the pine siskin was one of the few species\\nof birds noted.   It was present at Sergief Island, but not numerous.\\nThe one nest found (no. 1810), taken near Telegraph Creek, was\\nin a small lodgepole pine in very open woods, the same tract where the\\nBohemian waxwings were nesting. It was about six feet from the\\nground, resting against the main stem and well-nigh hidden by the\\nclusters of needles upon the small supporting branches. The structure is well built and compact, composed outwardly of small twigs and\\nthe white down from the fireweed; the lining, of grasses and some moss\\nfrom the trees. The outside diameter of the nest is about 90 millimeters,, depth, about 60; inside diameter, about 60, inside depth, 25\\nmillimeters.\\nThe eggs, three in number, were slightly incubated. They are a\\nlittle paler than lichen green; in two cases there is a wreath of reddish1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        239\\nspots at the large end, in the third egg this wreath is reduced to a few\\nminute spots. Seven specimens of this bird were collected, all adults\\n(nos. 39910-39916). Four are from the vicinity of Telegraph Creek,\\none from Glenora, one from Doch-da-on Creek, and one from Flood\\nGlacier. These birds are grayer in general coloration than most of the\\nspecimens in a comparable series from the Alaskan coast, but there\\nare individuals in the coastal series not to be distinguished from those\\ntaken in the interior.\\nCalcarius lapponicus alascensis Ridgway.   Alaska Longspur\\nSeen only at Sergief Island, where it occurs merely as a migrant.\\n' First noted on September 3, and the two following days, our last in\\nthe field, small flocks appeared from time to time.   All the birds seen\\nwere flying, passing overhead in a southerly direction.\\nPasserculus sandwichensis savanna (Wilson). Savannah Sparrow\\nSeen only at Sergief Island. Upon our arrival there, August 17,\\nSavannah sparrows were present though not abundant. Some days\\nlater they increased greatly in numbers, and at the end of August\\nwere found everywhere over the marshes. They kept mostly to the\\nflooded grass lands, a much wetter habitat than that favored by the\\nsong and Forbush sparrows, also abundant at the same station.\\nNine specimens were collected (nos. 39921-39929). The discovery\\nthat the subspecies alaudinus breeds but a short distance inland (see p.\\n240) was an incentive toward an accurate determination of the status\\nof the quite distinct coastal subspecies. This coastal subspecies, formerly lumped with Passerculus s. alaudinus, has been latterly referred\\nto savanna, of eastern North America, to which it bears'a close resemblance (see Grinnell, 19096, p. 227; Swarth, 1911, p. 85). There is\\nno doubt, however, that the form occurring on the coast of southeastern\\nAlaska is entirely cut off from the habitat of the eastern savanna by\\nthe intervention of the range of alaudinus. It is a local race that is\\nprobably confined almost entirely to the Alaskan coast, and with but\\na limited migration, one extending usually not much farther southward\\nthan the Puget Sound region. There is apparently no place where it\\napproaches at all closely the habitat of the eastern savanna. A thousand miles or more, must intervene. Nevertheless, despite the wide\\ndifference in habitat, birds from the two regions are so much alike in\\nappearance that I am unable to detect any character whereby they\\n: '   .     '\\u2022\\nHIE240\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [VoL- 24\\ncan be distinguished. It is a puzzle just what should be the proper\\nnomenclatural treatment of these forms. In all probability the relationships of the two are not particularly close. It seems likely that\\nthere is continuous distribution of Savannah sparrows along the\\nPacific coast of North America, with probable intergradation between\\nthe Alaska forms and the darker colored California subspecies, and\\nthis, I believe, is the line of closest affinities.\\nI am willing to admit geographical distribution as one of the characters of a form, but to make distribution the sole character is farther\\nthan I care to go. So, on the ground of external resemblance, the\\nSavannah sparrow of the coast of southeastern Alaska is here recorded\\nas P. s. savanna, but with no belief that it is genetically the same as\\nthe eastern subspecies bearing that name. The case is closely paralleled by the red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra sitkensis and L. c. minor).\\nPasserculus sandwichensis alaudinus Bonaparte.

On\\nMay 31, at the Junction, the mangled remains of one were found in a\\nmousetrap, our first intimation of the arrival of the species. Several\\nwere seen at the Summit, June 4; a male bird collected at that time\\nappeared to be breeding. At Glenora there were a few scattered\\nthrough the weed-grown fields, and they were evidently nesting there.\\nThe males were uttering their wheezy trills from the tops of low bushes\\nor from fences or stakes, and could be found at about the same spots\\nday after day.   Females collected were evidently incubating.\\nNo Savannah sparrows were seen farther down the river than\\nGlenora until we Teaehed the coast, the habitat of another subspecies.\\nThere are not many places in the Telegraph Creek region that afford\\nthe needed surroundings for this bird, for extensive clearings supplying the open ground they favor are found in but few places. Where\\nwe saw them at the Summit is at about the upper limit of timber, and\\nit may be that the species occurs commonly in such a habitat. We\\nsaw no Savannah sparrows, however, on the mountain top above Doch-\\nda-on Creek.\\nFour specimens collected (nos. 39917-39920), two adult males and\\ntwo adult females. These are obviously different from P. s. savanna\\nof the coastal region. Compared with the latter the Telegraph Creek\\nbirds are of grayer coloration, have a longer wing, and a more slender19221\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        241\\nbill. They are apparently the same as the form occurring in the uplands of west central and southern California in winter, to which the\\nname Passerculus s. alaudinus has been applied (see Palmer, 1918,\\np. 123).\\nZonotrichia leucophrys gambeli (Nuttall). Gambel Sparrow\\nFairly common in the river valley at Telegraph Creek. This may\\nbe taken as near the western limit of the summer habitat of this\\nsubspecies in this region, for although the birds were numerous in\\nand about the town of Telegraph Creek, they became notably scarce a\\nvery few miles farther down the river. In our two weeks' collecting\\nat Glenora but one bird was seen, and none was observed farther down\\nstream, with the exception of one at Sergief Island after the fall migration had begun.\\nSeveral nests were found near Telegraph Creek. On June 6 a\\nbird was seen carrying building material. On June 11 and 14 three\\nnests were discovered on certain slopes near Sawmill Lake where most\\nof the timber had been removed. They were much alike in site and\\nconstruction, placed on or near the ground under the piles of brush\\nleft from the trees that had been cut away. Each contained newly\\nhatched young, three and four in number. The parent bird, when\\nfrightened by our near approach, did not fly direct from the nest, but\\nskulked through the brush for ten or twelve yards before flying.\\nTwo specimens collected, an adult male at Telegraph Creek (no.\\n39930), and an immature female (no. 39931), taken at Sergief Island,\\nSeptember 4, the only one seen at that point.\\nZonotrichia coronata (Pallas). Golden-crowned Sparrow\\nThe closely related golden-crowned and Gambel sparrows occupied\\ndifferent local habitats, although both occurred commonly in the same\\ngeneral region. Presumably Telegraph Creek is near the eastern limit\\nof the habitat of coronata, just as it is at the western confines of the\\nsummer home of gambeli. Their segregation apparently is due to\\nzonal limitations. The golden-crowned sparrow is a bird of a higher\\nzone than the Gambel sparrow, consequently, in the Stikine region,\\nconfined to higher altitudes. No coronata was seen near the town of\\nTelegraph Creek (altitude 540 feet), where gambeli was common, but\\non the trail to the Summit (twelve miles north of town and at about\\n2700 feet altitude) they appeared in some numbers where the timber\\niff\\nII\\niff\\n'mi\\n\\u2022 fir\\nn'til a\\n1242\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [VoL- 24\\n\\u00ab\\nI !\\u25a0\\nMill'!\\nbecame dwarfed and scattered. The birds were in full song during\\nthe first week in June. A female shot June 5 contained eggs just beginning to form.\\nAs we went down stream the species was seen nowhere in the bottom\\nlands, but it was encountered once more on the mountains above Doch-\\nda-on Creek. There we found the birds at timber line, on July 11\\nand again on July 23. Dixon found them amid similar surroundings\\non a mountain a few miles north of Doch-da-on Creek (\\\"Kirk's Mountain\\\") on July 16, and saw two bobtailed young. At these several\\npoints they were at the extreme upper limit of timber, at about 3000\\nto 4000 feet altitude, and mostly in dense thickets of prostrate \\\"mountain balsam\\\" (Abies lasiocarpa). From these shelters could be heard\\na sharp, far-reaching chip, a note that was difficult to locate, but was\\nfinally traced to the golden-crowned sparrow. The birds were undoubtedly nesting in the balsam thickets. Probably they had young\\nat the time, but careful search failed to reveal any except the two that\\nDixon saw while stalking a mountain goat. On July 23 the birds were\\nnoticeably fewer in numbers than they had been on our first visit to\\ntheir habitat on July 11, and it seemed probable that they had already\\nbegun to leave.\\nIt seems likely that the timber-line habitat of coronata extends\\nwestward nearly or quite to the Alaskan coast. With field glasses we\\nwere able to see, at various points down the Stikine, ridges and mountain tops that appeared to be much like the high altitudes we reached\\nfrom the upper river. Near the coast, however, the mountains are in\\nmost places extremely hard to ascend, and the fauna of their summits\\nis as yet unknown. The golden-crowned sparrow is a species of high\\nHudsonian and Alpine-Arctic. It is a bird of the coastal region rather\\nthan of the interior, but, except at the northern end of its habitat, is\\napparently restricted to high altitudes during the summer months.\\nDuring the migrations this sparrow is abundant at sea level. At\\nSergief Island the first one appeared on September 1. The next day\\nthe species was present in considerable numbers. Seven specimens\\ncollected (nos. 39932-39938), three at the Summit, June 4 and 5, one\\non the mountain above Doch-da-on Creek, July 23, and three on Sergief\\nIsland, September 1 to 5.\\nSpizella montieola ochracea Brewster.   Western Tree Sparrow\\nSeen at but one place.   At the Summit, some twelve miles north\\nof Telegraph Creek and at about 2600 feet elevation, several pairs of\\nwestern tree sparrows were seen on May 29, June 4 and 5, evidently1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        243\\nnesting there. The birds were seen feeding on the ground at the edges\\nof marshy meadows, usually near the shelter of thickets of scrubby\\nwillow brush. The three specimens collected (nos. 39939-39941) are\\nnot to be distinguished from examples at hand from the Yukon and\\nKotzebue Sound regions, Alaska. I have seen a specimen collected by\\nE. P. Walker-at Wrangell, January 16, 1919. This capture may\\nindicate the occasional passage of the species down the Stikine Valley.\\nSpizella passerina passerina (Bechstein). Eastern Chipping Sparrow\\nAbundant at low altitudes in the upper Stikine Valley. Many\\nseen near Telegraph Creek, in sparsely wooded sections, the males frequently singing from some low perch. Two nests were found here, on\\nJune 19 and 24. Each was in a lodgepole pine sapling, some ten feet\\nfrom the ground, and in each case the tree was too slender to be\\nclimbed. The species was likewise abundant at Glenora and at Doch-\\nda-on Creek. It was not seen farther down the river. Seven specimens collected, all adults (nos. 39942-39948). These, and others from\\nnorthern British Columbia, in color and measurements are much nearer\\nto eastern passerina than to typical arizonae from Arizona.\\nJunco hyemalis connectens Coues. Cassiar Junco\\nWe collected forty-four specimens of this junco, as follows: vicinity of Telegraph Creek (between that point and the Summit), twenty-\\neight (fourteen adult males, twelve adult females, and two juvenals) ;\\nGlenora, seven (one adult male, three adult females, and three juvenals) ; Doch-da-on Creek, three (one adult male, two juvenals) ; Flood\\nGlacier, six adult males. (Museum nos. 39949-39988, 39990, 39993,\\n39998, 39999.)\\nThe systematic status of the junco of the Stikine region is a matter\\nof more than ordinary interest to both the taxonomist and the student\\nof geographic distribution\\\" and evolution. Any treatment accorded\\nthis form would doubtless arouse criticism from some direction, but\\nit seems to me desirable that the race be accorded formal subspecific\\nstatus. This junco is, in my opinion, a \\\"good subspecies,\\\" a geographic race, in the sense that the birds over a certain area (of undetermined extent but undoubtedly a considerable stretch of country)\\nexhibit a combination of characters distinguishing them from other\\ndescribed forms, and they remain true to these peculiarities within as\\nclose limits as do most recognized subspecies.\\nBii\\nIII\\n1244\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\ntill ir'Jii\\nllifll\\ntiW'-.i-\\nThe outstanding characteristics of the Cassiar junco are as follows:\\nMost nearly related to Junco hyemalis hyemalis. Males of the two\\nsubspecies are very closely similar, differing in minor particulars as\\ndetailed beyond. The average female of Junco h. connectens is quite\\nunlike female hyemalis. It has ordinarily more or less pink on the\\nsides and brown on the back; the head is of a darker color and is\\nsharply cut off from the brownish back above and from the pink sides\\nand white belly below. The general appearance of the female is like\\nthat of the female Junco oreganus shufeldti, from which it differs in\\nhaving usually less brown on the back and less pink on the sides.\\nNow, as regards the name to be used for this form. My first impression was that here was an undescribed subspecies, a \\\"new\\\" race\\nthat required a new name. It was evident, however, that this was a\\nmigratory form, and that individuals must have been collected in their\\nmore southern winter home, even though the summer habitat had not\\nheretofore been explored. There was at least a chance that a winter-\\ntaken specimen had served as the basis of a description at some time.\\nA search through junco synonymy disclosed one name that seemed to\\nrequire investigation, Junco hiemalis connectens Coues (1884, p. 378),\\nwhich has been applied in various ways. Two specimens, the one upon\\nwhich this name was based, together with another like it, females collected at Colorado Springs, Colorado, April 26 and 27, were described\\nin some detail by Allen and Brewster (1883, p. 189) under the name\\nJunco hiemalis oregonus. They are there considered as '' intermediates\\nbetween hiemalis and oregonus.\\\" Ridgway (1901, p. 276) lists Coues'\\nconnectens as a probable hybrid under the heading \\\"Junco hyemalis\\nx Junco oreganus shufeldti.\\\" In a footnote (loc. cit.) he makes the\\nfollowing comment:\\nThis type specimen, which I have carefully examined and compared, is No. 7046\\nof Mr. Brewster's collection, and was taken by Mr. Brewster at Colorado Springs\\nApril 26, 1882. It is very nearly typical of J. hyemalis, with sides only slightly\\ntinged with cinnamomeous and the back slightly brownish. It may be a young\\nfemale, of the preceding year, of /. hyemalis; at any rate it has nothing to do\\nwith the form of /. oreganus (J. o. shufeldti), to which the name connectens was\\nunadvisedly applied by action of the A. O. TJ. Committee in 1896.\\nDwight (1918, p. 289) remarks as follows:\\nThis is perhaps an appropriate place to discuss briefly and to dispose of the\\n\\\"Junco hyemalis connectens\\\" of Coues. The original description (1884, Key\\nNorth Amer. Birds, 2d ed., p. 378) is a curious mixture of fact and fancy but,\\nfortunately, the type is extant in the collection of Mr. Wm. Brewster (No. 7046,1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n245\\n$, April 26, 1882, Colorado Springs, Colo.). I have examined it and, as correctly stated by Mr. Ridgway (1901, Birds North and Middle Amer., Pt. 1,\\np. 276, footnote), it is clearly a specimen of hyemalis, and shows the characters\\ncommon to sex and season.\\nThe American Ornithologists' Union Committee (1897, p. 128;\\n1910, p. 266) follows Coues (1897, p. 94) in applying the name connectens to the form named Junco hyemalis shufeldti by Coale (1887,\\np. 330) and re-named (as I believe) Junco oregonus couesi by Dwight\\n(1918, p. 291).\\nIt is thus seen that the two men (Ridgway and Dwight) who have\\nmost carefully studied the genus Junco in recent years unite in the\\nbelief that connectens is not a recognizable form. It is after some\\nhesitation that I offer a contrary opinion, but I believe that the new\\nmaterial at my disposal justifies my view. As to the treatment of the\\nname connectens by the A. 0. U. Committee, I am of the same opinion\\nas Ridgway, that it is wrongly applied in the Check-List to the form\\nthat should be called Junco oreganus shufeldti Coale. The description\\nby Allen and Brewster (1883, p. 189) of the Colorado bird that served\\nlater as the type of connectens, obviously a migrant or winter visitant\\nat the point of capture, fitted so nearly my specimens from the Stikine\\nregion as to lead me to suspect them to be the same. This bird, as part\\nof the Brewster collection, is now in the collection of the Museum of\\nComparative Zoology, at Cambridge. I have not examined it myself,\\nbut at the kind suggestion of Mr. Outram Bangs I sent him a selected\\nseries of the Stikine birds for comparison with the type of connectens,\\nand, incidentally, with any other pertinent material. He remarks upon\\nthem as follows:\\nI have compared the skins most carefully with our very large series of eastern\\nbirds     The very black, sharply marked off top of the head in your male\\nbirds I cannot match. The type of J. connectens Coues is a female taken at\\nColorado Springs, Colorado, Apr. 26, 1882. It is a counterpart of your no. 10945\\n(Mus. Vert. Zool., no. 39957). Indeed you would have difficulty in telling the\\ntwo apart, except that the type of connectens is, although taken at an earlier\\ndate, in a little more worn plumage. I can't find spring females from the east\\njust like these, but on the other hand, autumnal females much resembling them\\n(probably young birds of the year?) are common in our series.\\nFor comparison with hyemalis, the form to which I believe connectens is most nearly related, I have had an abundance of non-breeding birds from various places in the eastern United States, and a few\\nfrom western points. No series of breeding birds of the eastern Junco\\nh. hyemalis is available.\\nI\\n1\\nilii\\n\\u2014246\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [YoL- 24\\ni ijBfe\\nThe adult male of connectens is very similar to hyemalis. At first\\nglance, in the field, there was no doubt in my mind that hyemalis\\nwas the form encountered. Comparison with eastern birds, however,\\nshows certain appreciable differences. Connectens is darker colored\\nthroughout, and, compared with the more uniformly slaty hued\\nhyemalis, is seen to possess a blackish head, quite sharply defined at a\\nline above the shoulders. Beneath, in connectens, the outline of the\\nblack breast is convex against the white belly, forming a sharp angle\\nwhere it joins the gray sides. In eastern hyemalis the slaty breast\\nand sides usually form a concave outline against the white belly. In\\nmost cases, a specimen of connectens viewed laterally is seen to possess\\na black head pattern above and below, just about as in Junco oreganus,\\nthough, of course, more obscurely indicated than in that species. These\\ndistinctions, as just detailed, would not amount to very much in a\\nsingle bird, perhaps, but viewed in mass effect, with specimens of the\\nthree forms arranged in parallel rows, the differences are readily\\nnoticeable. The black-headed appearance of the male is a feature that\\nis conspicuous in the live bird.\\nThe female of connectens is, as a rule, more nearly like the female\\nof a subspecies of the black-headed Junco oreganus group than like\\nfemale hyemalis. The sides are more or less tinged with pink (often\\nquite strongly so), and the back with brownish. The blackish head is\\nsharply defined against the back and against the pink sides and white\\nbelly. Two among the fifteen females from Telegraph Creek and\\nGlenora have no pink on the sides, though with brown on the back.\\nThese two birds are most nearly like hyemalis. Of the others it is safe\\nto say that not one would be ascribed to hyemalis if taken in its winter\\nhome, with nothing but the appearance of the bird as a guide to its\\nspecific identity. There are certain winter specimens of Junco oreganus shufeldti at hand from southern Arizona, that, so far as color\\nand markings are concerned, are indistinguishable from some Stikine\\nRiver females. Arizona specimens of shufeldti, however, are distinctly\\nlonger winged.\\nThus there is here a race in which the male bears a strong resemblance to one specific group (Junco hyemalis), and the female to another (Junco oreganus), this race occurring at a point where the\\nboundaries of the two species mentioned come close together. Different\\nauthorities take different views regarding the relationship of the two\\nforms, hyemalis and oreganus. In the A. 0. U. Check-List of North\\nAmerican Birds (1910, p. 266) they are treated as two subspecies offlfe\\n1922J        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        247\\none species. Ridgway (1901, pp. 278, 283) regards them as specifically\\ndistinct, each divided into several subspecies. Dwight (1918, pp. 285,\\n'291) also considers them as two species. Dwight, however, regards\\nas of hybrid origin several forms of Junco that are accorded subspecific,\\nor even specific, rank, by Ridgway and others. All \\\"confusing\\nplumages,'' found in the borderlands where different species of Junco\\ncome together, he regards as the result of hybridism.\\nIn view of these different opinions, it is of interest to secure specimens and study conditions at places where two distinctly characterized\\nforms' meet. The upper Stikine Valley is such a place, and, with these\\npoints in mind, the junco of that region received special attention in\\nour field work. Though anticipating some interesting discoveries in\\nthe distribution of the forms involved, it could hardly be foreseen that\\nthis borderland should be occupied by a race so curiously combining\\nthe characters of the eastern hyemalis and the western oreganus. With\\nthe ascertaining of this fact there now remains the proper application\\nof it, and in this I fancy there will be difference of opinion.\\nFirst, is the occurrence of birds of this description (in a sense, intermediate between hyemalis and oreganus) to be taken as indicative of\\nintergradation between the two ? Are hyemalis and oreganus therefore\\nto be regarded as two subspecies of the same species? I think not.\\nThere is no adult specimen in the connectens series that could for a\\nmoment be confused with the coastal junco (Junco oreganus oreganus),\\nthe subspecies geographically most closely adjacent to the upper Stikine\\nrace. There are no doubtful specimens as between these two forms,\\nhence no intergradation. The measurements of connectens do not show\\nintergradation between Junco h. hyemalis and Junco o. oreganus (see\\ntable, p. 254). The resemblance of the female connectens is toward\\nJunco o. shufeldti (\\u2014Junco h. connectens of the A. 0. U. Check-List),\\na pale colored form of Junco oreganus occurring to the southward.\\nThere may be intergradation between connectens and shufeldti farther\\nsouth in British Columbia, but as yet we do not know that to be the\\ncase.\\nThen, as to the theory of hybridizing, used to a great extent in\\ncomparable cases by Dwight in his study of the juncos (1918). Such a\\ndecision in the present case (as in certain others so disposed of by\\nDwight) seems to me to distort the meaning of the word hybrid out of\\nall recognition, and to apply it to facts and conditions it is not commonly called upon to cover. I am willing to admit that a name such as\\nJunco annectens Baird may have been applied to an individual bird\\n-:S !5S\\np (\\u25a0\\npi -I\\nfi    i\\n\\u2022;\\u25a0\\u25a0\\nl;        j!\\n1\\nV '\\u2022248\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\n1 i'fll\\nSlil'lll\\nIPHilii\\n[Ma J* li -1'   r'-.V\\nil 111\\nactually of hybrid parentage in the usually accepted sense, in that\\nparticular case with one parent Junco caniceps, the other, Junco\\nmearnsi; and I am willing to admit (see postea) that individual hybrids\\nmay occasionally occur between any species of Junco whose ranges\\nadjoin. To consider as hybrids, however, all the birds (juncos in this\\ninstance) of a whole region, despite the facts that they comprise the\\nonly representative of the species in. that region, that they all exhibit\\nthe same combination of characters over a wide stretch of country, and\\nthat they breed true, that is, transmit these same characters to their\\nyoung, is an utterly misleading use of the term. The junco of the\\nStikine River should not be regarded as a hybrid.\\nAs bearing upon the fact that it is the female of connectens that\\nshows variation from the hyemalis type, attention may be drawn to\\nthe following statement by Dwight (loc. cit., p. 289) : \\\"The variation\\nin females of the three species [i.e., hyemalis, oreganus, and mearnsi]\\ncomplicates the question still more, for the average females of the\\nthree differ much less from one another than do the males, and the\\nhybrids between them would seem therefore to be much more numerous.\\\" I suppose the application of this to the present case (the\\njunco of the Stikine region) would lead to the conclusion that here\\non a large scale is an example of sex-linked inheritance; that in the\\nhybridization of hyemalis and oreganus the female offspring only show\\nthe oreganus characters. That such is not the case is shown .by specimens collected at Flood Glacier (described farther on), where the race\\nhere designated connectens comes into actual contact with oreganus.\\nMy own conclusions are as follows: The junco of the Stikine region\\nis a recognizable form, apparently the same to which Coues applied the\\nname Junco hiemalis connectens. It is most nearly related to Junco\\nhyemalis hyemalis, and may be conceded to exhibit intergradation of\\na sort, as between Junco hyemalis and Junco oreganus. That is, the\\npeculiarities of this subspecies undoubtedly have some bearing upon\\nthe relationship of those two aggregations of races. The intergradation exhibited, however, is apparently as between the two species Junco\\nhyemalis &nd,Junco oreganus, rather than between two adjacent subspecies, Junco hyemalis connectens and Junco oreganus oreganus. It\\nis not of the sort that is usually found between two subspecies of the\\nsame species, and for the present it may well be disregarded as a sub-\\nspecific criterion. It seems to me that this is a proper place for a\\nsomewhat arbitrary division, and that Junco hyemalis and Junco\\noreganus should still be regarded as separate specific groups.   Then,1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n249\\nas previously shown, the junco of the Stikine region, although-in a\\nsense intermediate in appearance between hyemalis and oreganus, can\\nnot properly be considered as an aggregation of hybrid individuals.\\nThe only alternative left, therefore, is to consider this form as a distinguishable geographical race of the species it most nearly resembles,\\nand apply a separate name, as I have done.\\nAs we descended the Stikine, leaving the habitat of connectens\\nbehind and drawing nearer to that of oreganus, every effort was made\\nto secure juncos.   At Telegraph Creek and Glenora, juncos (connectens) were abundant.   At Doch-da-on Creek, though in lessened numbers they were still fairly numerous, and all still of the same subspecies.\\nOur next stop was at Flood Glacier, some forty miles down stream\\nand about seventy miles from the coast.   There we were in a region\\nwhere either coast or inland species might occur, and the junco was\\none of several birds that we searched for especially at that point.\\nJuncos were not numerous, however, and our two weeks of collecting\\nthere yielded but fifteen specimens.    Of these, eight are adults, six\\nmales and two females.   The two females are Junco o. oreganus-, beyond\\na doubt.    Of the male birds, one (no. 39999) is typical connectens.\\nIt is in extremely worn plumage but is evidently of exactly the same\\ncharacter as Telegraph Creek specimens.   One bird (no. 39993), while\\nnot an average connectens (it shows some rusty on the back), can be\\nmatched by one variant taken at Telegraph Creek.    Another  (no.\\n39998) is somewhat more reddish on the back, though the sides are\\nslaty.   The remaining three adult males (nos. 39987, 39988, 39990),\\nif taken farther south, in their winter home, would undoubtedly be\\nconsidered as examples of Junco oreganus shufeldti.   They are shorter\\nwinged than Arizona winter specimens of shufeldti, but they have\\nthe black head (a glossier black above than in connectens), brownish\\nback, and pink sides of that race.    However, despite their general\\nappearance, I cannot believe that these birds are shufeldti.   I do not\\nbelieve it possible for the habitat of that subspecies to extend northward as a tongue inserted between the ranges of connectens and\\noreganus.    Juncos can not be distributed uninterruptedly from the\\nsouthward over the glacier covered mountains that constitute so large\\na part of this intermediate region.   Their distribution must lie in narrow ribbons along the river valleys extending from the interior to the\\ncoast, such as the Stikine, and the affinities of birds taken at any one\\npoint in these valleys must lie with others immediately adjacent, above\\nand below.    Therefore, despite the superficial resemblance of these250\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [YoJj- 24\\nFlood Glacier juncos to shufeldti, I decline to consider them as of that\\nsubspecies, or to call them by that name. This despite Dr. Dwight's\\nbelief that \\\"we must name a bird by the plumage it is wearing not\\nby the one that it ought to be wearing because it has been captured\\nwithin the bounds assigned to another geographical race\\\" (1918,\\np. 294).\\nFlood Glacier is close to the point where the change in the character\\nof the country takes place, between the humid coast and the arid\\ninterior. It is the uppermost point on the river reached by certain\\ncoastal species of birds; very few indeed go any farther inland. Not\\nmany inland species extend farther down the river. We took here\\nspecimens of typical connectens and of oreganus, besides these intermediates. Forty miles up stream nothing but connectens was seen.\\nThirty miles farther down the river, at Great Glacier, nothing but\\ntypical oreganus.\\nIn view of these facts it seems to me that these few specimens of\\nindeterminate character, taken practically on the boundary line between the habitats of the two forms, may be regarded as veritable\\nhybrids between the two. They are certainly not indicative of intergradation as it usually appears between closely related subspecies.\\nThe seven juvenals from Flood Glacier naturally offer difficulties\\nin their allocation such as are not encountered in adults^ Young of\\nconnectens taken early in the season in the upper Stikine Valley,\\ncompared with the corresponding stage of oreganus from the coast,\\npresent certain obvious differences. As the juvenal feathers become\\nfaded and abraded, however, these distinctions are much less apparent,\\nand the young birds from Flood Glacier had worn the juvenal plumage\\nto the molting time. Those that do show specific peculiarities all lean\\ntoward oreganus, and one or two, otherwise indeterminable, were taken\\nin company with an adult female oreganus. There are available but\\nvery few breeding specimens of slate-colored junco from Alaskan\\npoints. These specimens on the whole look more like eastern hyemalis\\nthan like Stikine River connectens. The only breeding females, one\\nfrom Cordova Bay and one from Rapids, Yukon River, are quite\\nunlike any females in the Stikine series.\\nI have had for examination a series of seventeen adult juncos,\\neight males and nine females, from the collection of the Provincial\\nMuseum, Victoria, British Columbia, taken at Atlin, during June and\\nJuly, 1914. Atlin is at the northern boundary of British Columbia,\\nabout one hundred and fifty miles north of Telegraph Creek.   For the1922] Swarth: Birds andjdammals of the Stikine Region        251\\nmost part these birds are essentially like the Stikine specimens. One\\nmale (Prov. Mus., no. 3683) is much paler colored than the others,\\nmore of the slaty gray of eastern hyemalis, a variation that may be\\nindicative of intergradation with hyemalis in Alaska, a little to the\\nnorthward. One female of the lot (Prov. Mus. no. 3698, Wilson Creek,\\nAtlin, B. C, June 29, 1914) is so very different in appearance from\\nthe rest of the series as to suggest its belonging to another species.\\nIt is appreciably larger than the others, actually so in length of wing\\nand tail, and to all appearances in bulk also, as well as can be judged\\nfrom prepared skins. It is faintly brownish on the back, and with a\\nsuggestion of pink on the sides. This bird may, perhaps, be an\\nexample of montanus, which has been recorded as occurring at Alaskan\\npoints not very far distant.\\nAltogether, the scanty material from Alaska, together with the\\nBritish Columbian series, points to the restriction of the race connectens to a region mostly south of Alaska, and probably almost entirely in\\nBritish Columbia. In this connection, attention should be drawn to\\na record by Bishop (1900a, p. 86) of the occurrence of \\\"Junco hyemalis connectens, Shufeldt Junco,\\\" at White Pass City and Glacier,\\nAlaska, a record that may, perhaps, pertain to connectens as here\\nregarded. Osgood (19096, p. 41) records Junco hyemalis montanus\\nfrom points on the upper Yukon: \\\"An adult female having vinaceous\\nsides and pronounced of this form by Mr. Ridgway was collected by\\nHollister at Circle July 7 Also a specimen collected by myself\\nnear Charlie Creek in 1899 appears to be of this form.\\\"\\nWhen we arrived at Telegraph Creek, May 23, juncos were abundant and in pairs; evidently nesting was well under way. The male\\nbirds at that time were fond of perching on some elevated position, a\\ntelegraph pole or a house in town, a dead tree top out in the woods,\\nwhere, over and over again, they gave utterance to a brief, monotonous\\ntrill, hardly long enough or loud enough to merit being termed a song.\\nThe first nest was found on June 4, about midway between Telegraph\\nCreek and the Summit, a region in which there was still much snow.\\nThis nest was placed in an overhung crevice in the dirt wall bordering\\nthe trail, and was discovered through the brooding bird's sudden departure. It contained four eggs with incubation just begun (see\\nfig. Z). From then on, nests were found at intervals up to July 5.\\nOn that date two were discovered at Glenora, one with four fresh eggs,\\none with four young about five days old.\\n\\u2022 1;!'252\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [Vol. 24\\nAll nests discovered were on the ground, but in a variety of situations.

The nests are all much alike in structure, rather flimsily built,\\nmainly of rather fine dry grass or weed stems, with occasionally some\\nshreds of bark or coarser twigs or straws on the outside, and with\\nfiner grass or hair for lining.\\nFig. Z.

A few were seen well up in the mountains, not in the dense\\nspruce forests of the middle heights, but at the upper edge of the\\ntimber, where the trees were more scattered and of smaller size. This\\nwas at about 4000 feet elevation.\\nThe male junco was sometimes seen making a display of his\\nplumage. The tail was widely spread, so as to expose the white outer\\nfeathers, about the only sharply contrasting feature of the junco'sKS^-\\n19221 Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n253\\nplumage. This was done, not on the ground, but up in the shrubbery;\\nthe tail was held stiffly spread and pointed straight downward, while\\nthe bird hopped from branch to branch about the female.\\nYoung birds, just out of the nest, were several times found infested\\nwith parasitic larvae. The first bird in this condition was collected\\nnear Telegraph Creek, June 15. On picking it up after shooting it,\\na maggot dropped to the ground, and I noticed then a bare spot on the\\nbird's head with a small hole where the larva had been attached. Upon\\nskinning it, two more larvae were found, between the skin and skull,\\nsurrounded by a mass of yellow serum. Later on other young juncos\\nwere taken similarly afflicted, with the larvae always on the top of the\\nhead. The larvae were white in color, seven millimeters long and about\\nthree in diameter.\\nJunco oreganus oreganus (J. K. Townsend).

Young\\noreganus is a ruddy appearing bird, young connectens, grayish. While\\nthese differences are apparent in fresh plumage, they are not so\\nobvious when the feathers become worn. The young birds from Flood\\nGlacier, at about the dividing line between the ranges of oreganus and\\nconnectens, are ready to discard the juvenal plumage, and in some\\nspecimens it is not possible to tell to which species they belong. However, those which do show specific peculiarities are apparently oreganus.\\nTwo young males, beginning the post-juvenal molt, are acquiring\\npink sides, and in one of them the new feathers on the head are distinctly blacker than in connectens. Young females, undeterminable\\nin appearance, were taken in company with an adult female oreganus.\\nFor these several reasons I have assigned the entire series of streaked\\nplumaged young from Flood Glacier to oreganus.\\nii!\\n9 ii   t!

Rusty Song Sparrow\\nSong sparrows are rare in the upper Stikine Valley, or, rather,\\nthe species occurs in relatively few place's. We found some birds\\naround Sawmill Lake and about marshy spots near Telegraph Creek,'\\nand a few in similar surroundings between that town and Glenora.\\nA female collected at Sawmill Lake on June 9 contained an egg that\\nwould have been laid in a day or two. A young bird just out of the\\nnest was taken on June 18.\\nNear Doch-da-on Creek and a mile or two back from the Stikine\\nthere were certain marshy meadows where song sparrows were really\\nabundant. Bordering the grassy areas were sloughs grown with reeds\\nand surrounded by willows. Here the song sparrows had evidently\\nbeen nesting, and at the time of our visit (July 8 to 26) were apparently engaged with their second broods. Full-grown young were more\\nabundant than adults, and by the middle of July we found these\\nyoung birds spreading out farther and farther away from the central\\nswamps and down toward the river. The old birds remained closely\\nwithin the more restricted meadows where we first found them, and\\nthose collected had every appearance of being engaged in nesting.\\nThese adults were extremely shy at all times, and specimens were\\nobtained with difficulty.\\nAt Flood Glacier there were a few song sparrows, seen mostly in\\npatches of fireweed near the river. All taken were juvenals, apparently\\nwandering from the nesting ground, as we had found them at Doeh-\\nda-on Creek.   We found no place near Flood Glacier offering suitable\\nli\\n; . \\u2022256\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     you 24\\nbreeding grounds for song sparrows. None of the birds was seen at\\n.Great Glacier but one was noted near the custom house just above the\\nboundary, August 16.\\nAt Sergief Island song sparrows were abundant. They were mostly\\nat the upper edge of the marsh land, just below the coniferous forest,\\nwhere a bordering strip of dense underbrush (alder, willow, devil's-\\nclub, and other shrubbery) afforded shelter to many birds of similar\\nhabits. The song sparrows ventured some distance out onto the\\nmarshes, but always along narrow tidal channels where tall grass overhanging the sloughs made arched passageways beneath which the\\nbirds found concealment when need arose.\\nA large proportion of those seen at Sergief Island were young birds,\\nand young and old were mostly in various stages of molt. A young\\nmale taken August 18 is in first winter plumage throughout. Most of\\nthe young birds seen at that time were still in juvenal plumage; one\\ntaken as late as September 1 had not yet begun the molt from that\\nstage. Two adults shot August 18 and 22, respectively, had not yet\\nbegun to molt; another taken on September 1 had almost completed\\nthe change.\\nForty-four specimens were collected (nos. 40020-40044, 40047-\\n40065), as follows: Telegraph Creek, three adult males, two adult\\nfemales, one juvenal female; Doch-da-on Creek, three adult males, ten\\njuvenals; Flood Glacier, four juvenals; Sergief Island, two adult\\nmales, one adult female, five immature males (first winter plumage),\\nthirteen juvenals.\\nI had anticipated that the song sparrow of Telegraph Creek would\\nprove to be different from the coast bird, and that it would probably\\nbe Melospiza m. inexpectata, as a specimen ascribed to that race was\\nrecorded from Telegraph Creek by Riley (1911, p. 234) in his description of the subspecies. I am, however, unable to distinguish any\\npoints of difference between birds from the upper Stikine Valley\\nand those from the coast.   They seem to me to be all referable to ruflna.\\nUpon first consideration it seems strange that in two regions with\\nsuch diverse faunas in general, as is the case in the upper Stikine\\nand the coast regions, the song sparrow, usually so variable, should\\nbe one of the few birds to remain the same in both places. This is by\\nno means inexplicable, however, upon consideration of some of the\\nfactors involved. The species Melospiza melodia extends much farther\\nnorth along the coast than it does inland; there is no subspecies of the\\ninterior that ranges nearly as far north as does ruflna of the coast.19221\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Reg\\nion\\n257\\nIt follows that any song sparrow colony of an interior point closely\\nadjacent to the coast (such as the Telegraph Creek region) must have\\nbeen derived from the coast region.\\nSong sparrows in other sections are known to be influenced in their\\ndistribution by extent of riparian surroundings suited to their needs.\\nThey will follow a favorable water course through otherwise unsuitable\\nsurroundings, less regardful of faunal or zonal limitations than of\\nthe associations of plants and water. It therefore seems apparent that\\nthe occurrence of the song sparrow at the headwaters of the Stikine\\nRiver represents an outpost of ruflna, an overflow of birds that have\\npenetrated to that point by ascending the river from the coast; not\\npart of another race that is of general distribution throughout the\\ninterior. Melospiza m. inexpectata may be a recognizable race in the\\nregion of the type locality (Moose Lake, British Columbia), in southeastern British Columbia, and southwestern Alberta (cf. Oberholser,\\n1918a, p. 187), but the song sparrow of northwestern British Columbia\\nis unmistakably ruflna.\\nApparently the song sparrows of the inland regions are not completely enough isolated from the parent stock, or have not been for a\\nsufficient length of time, to produce distinguishable differences. As\\nto the length of time that they have been there we have no means of\\nknowing. As to the completeness of isolation in the upper Stikine\\nValley, my impression, derived from the season's observations, is that\\nthere is practically continuous distribution of song sparrows along\\nthe river. Breeding colonies are doubtless scattered, and perhaps at\\nrather wide intervals, but apparently migrating birds occur at any\\npoint.\\nThere is an interesting point involved in the migration of the song\\nsparrows at the upper end of the Stikine Valley. Do these birds\\ntravel north and south to the eastward of the coast range, as is the\\ncase with so many other species of that region, or do they follow the\\nStikine to and from the coast? Our own observations shed no light\\nupon this question. It can hardly be solved save by some person who\\nis permanently residing in the country.\\nIn this connection it may be noted that Brooks (1912, p. 253)\\ndefinitely cites the subspecies ruflna as the form occurring at Okana-\\ngan, British Columbia, where the fauna otherwise is mostly of the\\ninterior. Also, Taverner. (1919, p. 84) records ruflna as the song\\nsparrow at Hazelton, in the interior of British Columbia, some two\\nhundred miles south of Telegraph Creek. I have seen some of Taverner's Hazelton specimens and agree with him in his determination.258\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol. 24\\nlill\\ni       11\\nin Pill\\nThe bird collection of this Museum contains sixty-three specimens\\nof ruflna from the islands and mainland of southeastern Alaska, representing many island localities and several points on the mainland.\\nThe largest series from any one place is that from Sergief Island.\\nThe Alaskan series as a whole displays considerable variation, in color,\\nin general size, and in size and shape of bill. Whether these differences\\ncan be correlated with different habitats, island and mainland, or\\nwhether they are merely differences between individual specimens,\\ncannot be settled with the material at hand; there are too few breeding birds from any one place. The variation is considerable, and it\\nincludes breeding birds that are just like the Telegraph Creek specimens. For the present, at least, the whole aggregation had best be left\\nunder the name ruflna.\\nThere is one kind of departure from the normal ruflna that is comprehensible, and that is a variation illustrated in many individuals\\ntending toward caurina, the subspecies breeding just north of the\\nhabitat of ruflna. This trend is especially noticeable among the birds\\ncollected upon Sergief Island in August and September, birds which\\nI believe were mostly migrants from the north. Typical ruflna and\\ncaurina are widely different in appearance, in size, color, and shape\\nof bill, but there are specimens at hand forming almost every link in\\na chain connecting one extreme with the other.

Typical examples of caurina\\nwere taken from time to time, as noted elsewhere in this report, which,1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        259\\nof course, were migrants, and the assumption is that those individuals\\nof intermediate character that were taken at the same time were also\\nmigrating birds, presumably from some intermediate region near the\\nnorthern limit of the habitat of ruflna.

Yakutat Song Sparrow\\nA fairly common migrant at Sergief Island, amid the same surroundings as ruflna. One was seen the day of our arrival, August 17,\\nand the birds were present in fluctuating numbers up to the date of\\nour departure, September 7. The third week of August was the time\\nof greatest abundance. Usually caurina and ruflna could be told apart\\nin life, the greater size and grayer color of the former serving to distinguish it ordinarily. There are, of course, equivocal specimens, as\\nmentioned in this report under ruflna, that are practically intermediate\\nbetween the two subspecies, and difficult of determination even when\\nin hand. There are also in the series of caurina from Sergief Island\\nsome specimens closely approaching the larger kenaiensis in appearance. As, however, the latter reach only the minimum measurements\\nof that subspecies it seems best to place them all under caurina. There\\nis thus in the available series of caurina a considerable range of variation exemplified, from small, reddish colored birds not widely different\\nfrom ruflna, to large, gray colored ones that could be inserted in a\\nseries of kenaiensis without violence.\\nThere is one bird from Sergief Island (no. 40045, female, August\\n18) that I refer to caurina despite the fact that it is largely in juvenal\\nplumage and was collected in the breeding range of ruflna. Such of\\nthe first winter plumage as has been acquired is distinctly of the\\ncaurma type, and in the flesh the bulk of this bird was decidedly\\ngreater than that of the average ruflna. Despite the youth of this\\nindividual, I believe it to be a migrant from the distant habitat of\\ncaurina. Juvenals of ruflna also were found traveling far from the\\nnesting ground.\\nFourteen specimens of Melospiza m. caurina were taken at Sergief\\nIsland, on dates ranging from August 18 to September 5 (nos. 40045,\\n40046, 40066-40077).

At the upper margin of the\\nmarshes, that section which is but rarely inundated by the tides, there\\nis much willow brush, increasing in density and size of the trees as the\\nsalt water is left behind. The lower edge of this strip, where the willow\\nbrush was about waist high and rather scattered, and with thick grass\\nbeneath, was the preferred habitat of the Forbush sparrow, and here\\nthe birds literally swarmed. I was accustomed to think of this species\\nas being rather solitary in its habits, but here, whether or not the\\nbirds were in constantly associated flocks, their choice of surroundings\\nbrought hundreds of them closely together. In traveling through the\\nwillow brush one flushed them from every thicket. On August 22 I\\nstopped to count those that hopped up into the branches of one small\\nbush, preparatory to taking flight at my approach, and there were\\nfifteen in sight at once.

It\\ndoes not follow; of course, that one or the other of these birds does not\\noccur locally somewhere in that general region, but if so I believe it\\nwill be found on the higher mountain slopes. I do not believe we\\ncould have overlooked the species had it been present in the lower\\nvalley.\\nFox sparrows were first encountered at Doch-da-on Creek. On\\nJuly 17 an adult male was obtained, first heard singing from its perch\\nnear the top of a small willow. A young bird was taken near-by the\\nsame day. Both were in brushy bottom land near a slough, a tangle\\nof willows growing amid nettles, tall grass, and other shrubbery, not at\\nall the kind of place that fox sparrows might be supposed to inhabit.\\nLater on, at Flood Glacier and again at Great Glacier, fox sparrows of the same subspecies were shot at various times. The birds\\nwere far from abundant, and it was only through the most assiduous\\nsearch that specimens were obtained.    They inhabited the densest\\nin\\n11 <\\n*-1 in\\n\\u00ab\\n\\\\262\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol. 24\\nbrush, where they remained out of sight for the most part, and there\\nwere neither songs nor call notes to draw attention to their presence.\\nAt Sergief Island one specimen referable to this subspecies was taken,\\non August 27.\\nIn all, fourteen specimens were collected (nos. 40093-40106), as\\nfollows: Doch-da-on Creek, one adult male, one juvenal male; Flood\\nGlacier, one adult female, one juvenal male, two juvenal females, one\\njuvenal, sex undetermined; Great Glacier, one adult male, two adult\\nfemales, two juvenal males, one male in first winter plumage; Sergief\\nIsland, one male in first winter plumage. The adults are all in worn\\nbreeding plumage or just beginning the annual molt. Of the young\\nbirds, some are in juvenal plumage throughout, some are partly\\nthrough the post-juvenal molt, and two, from Great Glacier, August\\n10, and Sergief Island, August 27, respectively, are in first winter\\nplumage throughout.\\nI had supposed that the form of fox sparrow that would be found\\ninhabiting the mainland coast of this part of Alaska would necessarily\\nbe P. i. townsendi, which is known to occur much farther south on certain of the islands. Our Stikine birds, however, unquestionably are\\nnot townsendi; for the present, at least, they must be considered as\\nfuliginosa. In my \\\"Revision of the avian genus Passerella\\\" (1920,\\np. 149), I have described a series of fox sparrows, winter visitants,\\ntaken mostly in the vicinity of Berkeley, California, that I have referred to fuliginosa, although they are not typical of that form. The\\nstatement there made is that these birds are too unlike summer examples of fuliginosa from Washington and Vancouver Island to come\\nfrom that region, and that they must be migrants from some other\\nsection. It was intensely interesting to discover that the Stikine River\\nsummer birds exactly matched the winter birds described from California.\\nAs between Alaskan examples of townsendi and the Stikine River\\nfuliginosa, we have in both series, for comparison, adults in similarly\\nworn breeding plumage; also young in juvenal plumage, molting into\\nfirst winter plumage, and in first winter plumage throughout. The\\ncolor differences are apparent in every stage. The discovery of fuliginosa in this part of Alaska and British Columbia discloses certain\\ndepartures from the distribution of that subspecies and of townsendi\\nas given by me in the \\\"Revision\\\" above cited (Swarth, 1920, pp. 144,\\n149; map, fig. N). Fuliginosa evidently occurs from Puget Sound\\nnorthward to the Stikine River, but, north of Vancouver Island, probably on the mainland only or perhaps on islands close to the British1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        263\\nColumbia coast. Townsendi occurs southward on various islands off\\nthe coast of southeastern Alaska, and on the Queen Charlotte Islands,\\nBritish Columbia; its occurrence in summer on the mainland of southeastern Alaska is questionable. I know of no breeding records from\\nthat region. On the map above cited there is a cross indicating an\\noccurrence at Helm Bay (south of the Stikine River), but the bird\\nupon which that record is based was an August specimen and may\\nhave traveled some distance. I, myself, in 1909, collected many specimens of townsendi at Port Snettisham and the Taku River, Alaska\\n(north of the Stikine River), and under circumstances that make it\\nseem likely that those were breeding stations, but no nests were actually found. In field work of that same year at Boca de Quadra, the\\nChickamin River, and Bradfield Canal (on the mainland south of the\\nStikine River), and at Thomas Bay (a short distance north of the\\nStikine), no fox sparrows were seen (see Swarth, 1911, p. 93). There\\nis a record of the occurrence of townsendi in June on Wrangell Island,\\nnear the mouth of the Stikine River (Swarth, 1920, p. 146).\\nThe facts now indicate that the summer distribution of fuUginosa\\nis from extreme northwestern Washington and Vancouver Island\\nnorthward on the mainland only, at least to the Stikine River. On\\nthe latter stream, it extends inland about a hundred miles, following\\nthe course of the river. Its extension inland elsewhere is unknown to\\nme. In fact, I know of no records of fuUginosa from any mainland\\nstation between the two extremes of its range, Puget Sound and the\\nStikine River.\\nThere is another point to be considered, namely, the possibility of\\nsubspecific difference between fuUginosa of the Puget Sound region\\nand the bird I have called fuliginosa from the Stikine River, sufficient\\ndifference, that is, to be worthy of recognition in nomenclature. This\\nis a contingency that may have to be met in the future. In another\\nconnection I have pointed out in some detail differences that appear\\nto exist between the two lots (Swarth, 1920, pp. 149-150). Briefly,\\nthe series comprised of the Stikine River specimens and the winter\\nbirds from Berkeley differ from certain Vancouver Island specimens\\nand from the type specimen of fuliginosa in being of a duller tone of\\nbrown, in having the lower tail coverts less tawny, and in the more\\nstubby bill. The differences are real, as far as the series go, and appear to be fairly constant; the difficulty lies in the few specimens available of typical fnMginosa. Under the circumstances further subspecific\\ndivision does not at present seem desirable.264\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [Vol. 24\\n'lill'f'.\\nllll\\nm\\nFall specimens of townsendi from Port Snettisham and the Taku\\nRiver are notably dark colored, as compared with summer specimens\\nof the same subspecies from the adjacent islands. While this may be\\ndue in some degree to seasonal differences of plumage, it may also be\\nindicative of intergradation toward fuUginosa at those points.\\nPiranga ludoviciana (Wilson). Western Tanager\\nA few seen in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek and Glenora, not\\nmore than seven or eight individuals in- all. The first noted, a male,\\nwas encountered near Telegraph Creek on June 18. A nest was found\\nat Four-Mile Creek, between Telegraph Creek and Glenora, in an alder\\nin the rather dense vegetation that bordered the stream, about twenty-\\nfive feet from the ground and four feet from the main trunk. The\\nfemale was seen on the nest July 5.\\nTwo specimens of the western tanager were preserved, both adult\\nmales, and both taken at Glenora, on June 30 and July 4, respectively\\n(nos. 40109-40110).\\nmm \\u25a0\\nPetrochelidon lunifrons lunifrons (Say).   Cliff Swallow\\nThere were a few pairs of cliff swallows breeding at Telegraph\\nCreek, the only place where we saw the species.   Nests, old and new,\\nwere placed on several houses in the town.    One specimen collected,\\nan adult female, on June 23 (no. 40111).\\nThis specimen is of notably large size, as compared with breeding\\nbirds from California and from Illinois. Presumably it belongs to the\\nnorthern subspecies that Oberholser (1919c, p. 95) has named Petrochelidon albifrons hypopoUa. As far as it goes, this single bird substantiates the claim of larger size in the northern race. The color\\ndifferences claimed for that form are not so apparent. The specimen\\nmeasures as follows: wing, 114; tail, 52.5; exposed eulmen, 7; tarsus,\\n13.\\nWithout wishing to decry the probable existence of a recognizable\\nnorthern race of the cliff swallow, the writer prefers, in this connection, to use the older name, pending a determination by the A. O. U.\\nCommittee on Nomenclature of the several questions involved.\\nHirundo erythrogaster Boddaert.   Barn Swallow\\nBreeding in fair abundance in the town of Telegraph Creek.   The\\nspecies was already there at the time of our arrival, May 23, and the\\nbirds were occupied with nest building.    Nests were seen only on1922\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        265\\nbuildings, and the birds themselves rarely strayed far outside the\\ntown. One nest noted, which was placed upon a telephone insulator\\non the government agent's office, must have been used for some years,\\nfor it was built up to a height of six inches or more.\\nFlocks of migrating swallows that were seen in August at several\\npoints down the river were apparently of this species, but could not\\nbe satisfactorily identified. These flocks were invariably traveling up\\nstream. In the harbor at Wrangell, August 16, were large numbers\\nof barn swallows, mostly young, flying about and alighting on the shipping and wharves. On Sergief Island, during the next two weeks, the\\nspecies was seen frequently, traveling southward in large flocks. The\\nflocks diminished in numbers toward the end of the month; the last\\nbird observed was a single individual on August 30.\\nTwo specimens of the barn swallow were preserved, an adult male\\nand an adult female, both taken at Telegraph Creek on June 11 (nos.\\n40112, 40113).\\nIridoprocne bicolor (Vieillot). Tree Swallow\\nJust one pair seen, at Sawmill Lake, near Telegraph Creek. They\\nwere nesting in an old woodpecker hole in a dead birch stub at the\\nmargin of the lake. A pair of mountain bluebirds were nesting in\\nthe same stub. The swallow's nest held three eggs on June 11; the\\ncomplete set of seven, with the nest, was taken on June 17 (no. 1816).\\nThe nest was built largely of coarse grass and pine needles, mixed\\nwith some mammal hair, and was lined with large duck feathers. The\\ntwo parent birds were taken (nos. 40114, 40115).\\nTachycineta thalassina lepida Mearns.   Northern Violet-green\\nSwallow\\nAbundant about Telegraph Creek. Nesting in crevices in the buildings and in a cliff overlooking the town from the northeast. The birds\\nwere settled in their nesting sites when we arrived (May 23), but individuals collected on June 8 had not yet laid their sets. The species\\nwas fairly abundant at Glenora. At Doch-da-on Creek, the latter part\\nof July, violet-green swallows were seen frequently.\\nAt Sergief Island, toward the end of August, the species was\\nencountered on so many occasions that it seems probable that it is of\\nregular occurrence as a migrant at some points, at least, on the coast\\nof southeastern Alaska, despite the paucity of records. As far as I\\nknow, my own observations on the Chickamin River and at Thomas\\niii '*266\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     you 24\\nIjllfi\\nlilt\\nBay are the only ones from the region that pertain to this species (see\\nSwarth, 1911, p. 96).\\nAt Sergief Island small flocks were seen passing over the marshes\\nin migration, usually in company with barn swallows, upon various\\ndates, ranging from August 20 to September 2. On August 28 a flock\\nof a hundred or more circled about over our camp for several hours.\\nLast noted on September 2, when a single bird was taken, the only one\\nobserved. It is a question whether the individuals seen migrating at\\nthis point were travelers from points to the northward, or whether\\nthey- had followed the Stikine River from the interior. I am inclined\\ntoward the first alternative, for, in our own leisurely descent of the\\nriver we had seen no indication of any such migration of these swallows.\\nFive specimens preserved, two adult females from Telegraph Creek,\\none adult male from Glenora, and two juvenal males from Sergief\\nIsland (nos. 40116-40120).\\nVM\\nII   II\\nRiparia riparia (Linnaeus). Bank Swallow\\nA few seen at Glenora, hovering over the fields or flying up and\\ndown the river, skimming low over the water. Probably nesting somewhere in the -river banks nearby, but we failed to discover where.\\nAt Sergief Island a few were seen from time to time (August 18, 19,\\nand 20), passing over the marshes in migration.\\nTwo adults secured, male and female, taken at Glenora, July 2\\nand 6, respectively (nos. 40121, 40122).\\nBombycilia garrula pallidiceps Reichenow. Bohemian Waxwing\\nFound in the lowlands bordering the Stikine River, from Telegraph Creek down stream as far as Doch-da-on Creek. There was no\\nobvious reason why the species should not extend still farther down\\nthe river, save that a few miles below this point those changes first\\nbegin to be apparent in the general character of the region that culminate in the thickly forested and humid conditions prevalent on the\\ncoast. Food conditions appeared ideal, for berries of various species,\\neaten freely by other birds, occur in abundance throughout this region.\\nIf it is solely the question of food that governs the erratic wanderings\\nof the waxwing, as is so frequently contended in connection with its\\nappearance in winter farther south, it would seem that the species\\nshould have been noted by us along the entire length of the Stikine.\\nIt seems evident, however, that there must be some barrier, more subtle19221 Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n267\\nthan that formed by the abundance or scarcity of food plants, that\\nkeeps the waxwing closely restricted to the upper part of the Stikine\\nValley.\\nSimilarly, restriction to the lower altitudes near the river is probably significant of zonal limitation. We saw no waxwings at high\\nelevations until July 23, when a flock of about twenty birds was\\nencountered at timber line (about 4000 feet) on the mountain above\\nDoch-da-on Creek.\\nDuring our first two weeks of field work, at the Junction, the\\nspecies was not once observed. Presumably the slightly greater elevation at that point was enough of a barrier to keep the waxwing in the\\nwarmer section by the river. When we moved from the Junction to\\nTelegraph Creek the birds were encountered at once, and they were\\nfound in some numbers thereafter at various nearby points.\\nA wood road, following the creek from which the town derives its\\nname, turns abruptly aside some half a mile up stream, ascends the\\nsteep embankment on the west, and thus reaches a terrace that extends\\nfor several miles. Here waxwings were seen upon our first visit to the\\nplace, and it was later found to be a favorite resort.\\nOn the morning of June 9 I had my first glimpse of the birds;\\nmy attention was attracted by the call note, and a moment later a\\nflock of a dozen or more swung past and disappeared over the tree tops.\\nLater in the day others were seen at almost the same place, two together at two different points. During the next ten days waxwings\\nwere seen continually in the same general locality, sometimes two together (mated pairs we supposed at the time), sometimes in small\\nflocks. We shot a few, but mostly we watched them and followed the\\n\\\"pairs\\\" about, hoping, but scarcely expecting, that they would lead\\nus to a nest. The actions of these birds were extremely puzzling, for\\nthey seemed quite carefree, and many were in flocks. When we did\\nobtain both birds of a \\\"pair\\\" they proved to be two males. Finally\\nit began to dawn upon us that the waxwings were coming daily to a\\nfavorite feeding ground\\u2014nothing more; when disturbed they always\\ndisappeared in the same direction over some low hills to the westward;\\nand our search was pursued in accordance with this suggestion, with\\nsatisfactory results.\\nThe terrace or plateau above mentioned, of which so far we had\\nmerely skirted the eastern edge, extends westward a mile or more, is\\nquite level, and but sparsely covered with forest growth. A year or\\nmore before our visit it had been swept by fire and a large part of the268\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol.\\ntimber destroyed. As we saw the place there was very little underbrush of any sort, a great many dead trees, mostly pines with some\\npoplars, and a scattering growth of live trees that had escaped destruction. The conifers were the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and\\nwere all small trees.\\nOn June 19 we first saw evidence of nesting activities, though, as we\\nafterward learned, the birds must have been busy for some time. On\\nthis occasion a pair of birds flew past, each with nest material in its\\nbill, and disappeared in a clump of little pines a short distance away.\\nA short search discovered the nest, just well started, in one of the\\npines, some six feet from the ground, and quite conspicuous to the\\nview. A second nest was found a short distance away at a point where\\nthere had been an Indian wickiup, occupied by a solitary old witchdoctor. Several days before, this habitation had been destroyed by\\nfire, and some of the surrounding trees, including the one with the\\nnest, somewhat scorched. Apparently the fire, smoke, and noise had\\nbeen too much for the parent waxwings, and they deserted the nest,\\nwhich contained five newly hatched young. The young were pretty\\nwell dried up when found.\\nOn June 22 the third nest was discovered. Two birds were seen\\nin flight toward a pine a hundred yards or so distant. One, the male\\npresumably, lit in the top of the tree, the other disappeared in the\\nfoliage below. Almost instantly the male flew high in the air, joined\\ntwo others that were passing by, and all three went off together toward\\nthe slopes where we had previously found so many of the birds feeding.\\nAn inspection of the pine disclosed the waxwing's nest. The tree was\\nonly about twenty-five feet high, with straggly branches and little\\nfoliage. The nest rested upon limbs and against the trunk, about\\nfifteen feet from the ground. It contained six eggs, almost ready to\\nhatch.\\nDuring the next few days several other nests were found. A record\\nwas kept of each one, though they did not all yield sets of eggs. Following are the particulars of all the nests discovered:\\nNo. 1 (Mus. Vert. Zool., no. 1819).

While these woods were thus fairly open, they were still\\nmuch denser than those in which we found the waxwings nesting at\\nTelegraph Creek. The two occupied nests were less than a hundred\\nyards apart, were exactly alike in location and structure, and when\\nfound each contained one fresh egg. Each was near the top of a fir,\\nabout twenty-five feet from the ground, supported upon a branch and\\nby surrounding twigs, and close to the trunk. On July 15 one of these\\nnests was taken, together with a set of three eggs. The other contained\\ntwo eggs, and was left undisturbed.

The nest, which contained but one egg,\\nwas about eighteen feet from the ground, and was built on a side\\nbranch of a small spruce that was growing at the outer edge of a clump\\nof thick spruces, on low ground. The nest was large, the base being\\nmade of small, dry spruce twigs. Internally it was constructed of\\nfine grass and moose hair, and lined thickly with large feathers.''\\nIn 1901, Brooks discovered the waxwing breeding at 158-Mile\\nHouse, in the southwestern corner of the Cariboo district, British\\nColumbia.\\nI first noticed them there on 11th June, when I came across a small flock and\\nshot one which proved pn dissection to be a female about to lay. On returning\\nto the same spot I found the Waxwings, consisting of a colony of five pairs of\\nbirds, still there, and soon discovered a nest in a Murray pine, near the end of\\na limb and about twenty-five feet up, this then (12th June) contained two eggs.\\nOn the 15th I took this set, which then consisted of four eggs. The nest was\\nloose and bulky, composed of Usnea moss, dry grass and weed stems, and lined\\nwith fine material, with a few green aspen leaves in the lining, no doubt to\\nrender the eggs less conspicuous. On the 26th June I carefully Jooked over all\\nthe trees in the neighborhood with my binocular, and found three more nests, all\\nin tall Douglas fir trees; two of these I was able to climb to; each contained\\nfour eggs within a few days of hatching. The nests were similar to the first\\nbut without the green aspen leaves, probably jhie to the fact that the nests were\\nbetter concealed from above (Brooks, 1903, p. 283).\\n11\\nOn June 10, 1908, R.

M.\\nAnderson, 19156, pp. 145-148). Without going into details, it may\\nbe said that in all essential respects of nest construction and location,\\nhis findings accord very closely with our own.\\nThese few records, covering six localities in the .Canadian northwest\\nand Alaska, appear to be the only authenticated instances of the actual\\ntaking of nests and eggs of the waxwing in North America. In addition may be cited Riley's statement (1912, p. 69) of the probable nesting of the species at Moose, in southeastern British Columbia. Though\\nhe found no nests, the conditions under which he found the birds were\\nsufficient proof of their breeding.\\nThe nesting of the European subspecies (Bombycilia garrula gar-\\nrula) was most carefully described by John Wolley (1857) in his\\nmemorable account of the first discovery of the nest and eggs of the\\nBohemian waxwing in Finland, and by Newton (1861) in a longer\\npaper describing the same material. Wolley's description of the nest\\nreads in part as follows:\\n\\\". . . . the main substance [of the nest] is of the kind of lichen\\ncommonly called tree-hair This main substance of the nest is\\nstrengthened below by a platform of dead twigs, and higher up towards\\nthe interior by a greater or less amount of flowering stalks of grass,\\nand occasionally pieces of equisetum.\\\" He also found a little reindeer lichen, green moss, .willow cotton, and fiber of grass leaves in the\\nstructure \\\\ sometimes one or two feathers in the lining. The nests were\\n\\\". . . . built on the branch of a tree, not near the bole, and rather\\n.... standing up from the branch . . . ., than supported by twigs\\ntouching it at the sides Of six nests, four were in small spruces,\\none in a good-sized Scotch fir, and one in a Birch\\u2014all placed at a\\nheight of from 6 to 12 feet above the ground .... the nest seems\\ngenerally much exposed In parts of the forest considerably\\nopen.\\n\\\"Five seems to be the ordinary number of eggs; in one nest only\\nthere were as many as six.\\n\\\"In the backward and cold spring of 1856, Waxwings had their\\nfull complement of eggs about the 12th of June\\\" (Wolley, 1857, pp.\\n55-56).\\n1\\nI276\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\nt\\nmm\\niilillw'\\nisi! \\u25a0i.-fPii\\nThe eggs of the four sets of the American subspecies obtained in\\n1919 on the Stikine River, and now in the Museum of Vertebrate\\nZoology, measure as follows:\\nSet no. 1818. 25.0 x 17.8, 24.2 x 17.8, 25.5 x 18.5, 25.2 x 17.5, 25.5 x\\n18.2, 26.0x18.0.\\nSet no. 1819. 24.2x17.0, 27.0x17.0, 27.0x17.2, 26.0x17.5, 26.2\\nx 17.2.\\nSet no. 1820. 26.8 x 17.8, 25.0 x 18.0, 26.5 x 18.0, 25.5 x 18.0, 26.8\\nx 17.8.\\nSet no. 1821.   24.8 x 18.0, 23.5 x 17.5, 24.0 x 18.0.\\nIn color, three of the sets are much alike, a pale glaucous blue, close\\nto Ridgway's \\\"pale dull glaucous-blue,\\\" but more washed out. This\\nground color is marked rather profusely with blackish dots and with\\na few fine, irregular lines, the dots mostly quite small and occurring\\nover nearly the entire egg, though less numerously at the smaller end\\nthan elsewhere. There are also obscure underlying spots of bluish, but\\nfaintly seen. The fourth set (no. 1821) is more olivaceous, the ground\\ncolor close to Ridgway's \\\"mineral gray.\\\" The spots are fewer in\\nnumber than in the other sets, larger, and more sharply defined.\\nAs to plumage, the more conspicuous variable features in the wax-\\nwing's markings are the waxlike tips to the secondaries, the white and\\nthe yellow markings on primaries, primary coverts, and secondaries,\\nand the yellow tips to the rectrices. The most elaborate study yet made\\nof the plumage of this species is that written by Henry Stevenson\\n(1882), based upon 144 specimens killed in England during the\\nwinter of 1866-67. Many of his statements are of interest in connection with the series of waxwings now in the collection of this\\nMuseum.\\nFirst, as regards the wax secondary tip, he gives the following\\ntable, including those birds of which the sex had been ascertained by\\ndissection.\\nMales\\n3 had 4 tips\\n7 had 5 tips\\n14 had 6 tips\\n14 had 7 tips\\n3 had 8 tips\\n41\\nFemales\\n*1\\nhad\\n2\\ntips\\n4\\nhad\\n3\\ntips\\n7\\nhad\\n4\\ntips\\n6\\nhad\\n5\\ntips\\n7 had\\n6\\ntips\\n2\\nhad\\n7\\ntips\\n1\\nhad\\n8\\ntips\\n28\\nSex uncertain.1922\\n2] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        277\\nA similar table of 38 specimens of the American subspecies in this\\nMuseum of which the sex has been ascertained is as follows:\\nMales\\n2 have 3 tips\\n6 have 4 tips\\n5 have 5 tips\\n8 have 6 tips\\n1 has 7 tips\\n22\\nFemales\\nhas no tips\\nhas traces of\\nhave 3 tips\\nhave 4 tips\\nhave 5 tips\\n7 have 6 tips\\n1 has 7 tips\\ntips\\n16\\nBesides those thus tabulated there are certain other variants. One\\nmale has a faint trace of a wax tip on a secondary on one side only.\\nOne female has two on one side, three on the other. One female has\\nfour on one side, two on the other. One female has five on one side, six\\non the other. Stevenson seemed to believe that such irregularities were\\ndue to accidents or wear, but in these birds there is no evidence to\\nshow that the unadorned secondaries had received any injury. One\\nfemale is indicated in the table as having traces of two tips. They\\nare so faint that they can be seen only by the most careful scrutiny,\\nand are devoid of red color. Of all the adult specimens examined,\\nforty-five in number, just one was found (a female) with absolutely\\nno trace of the wax tips. In several cases these tips show a decided\\ntendency to split up like feather barbs. It thus appears that these\\nappendages are formed by the coalescing of barbs, and not by an enlargement of the tip of the central shaft, though the shaft, too, is\\ninvolved in the general change. The ornamentation, in fact, may well\\nhave begun with the coloring of the shaft, spreading later over the\\nadjoining feather barbs. The last stage would have been the coalescing of the barbs, forming the waxlike scale as it is now seen. Various\\nsteps of this hypothetical evolutionary development are supplied in the\\nwing and tail feathers of different birds of this series.\\nThe primaries of the waxwing have a white or yellow marking near\\nthe tip. This marking is sometimes confined to the outer web, and\\nsometimes continued on to the inner web; the latter, producing a\\nV-shaped marking, has been designated by Stevenson (loc. cit.) as the\\n\\\"return margin.\\\" In the brightest colored birds these markings are\\nbright yellow on the inner primaries, becoming more and more white\\non the outermost ones. In the duller colored birds they are white\\nthroughout.    The V-shaped character is invariably accompanied by\\n.m278\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol. 24\\nII lilt\\n1 ii mm\\nmm\\nbright yellow outer margins, but the yellow color is not restricted to\\nthe individuals that have this \\\"return' margin.\\\" Some of the birds\\nwith the primary markings absolutely confined to the outer feather\\nmargins still have them of brilliant yellow. None of the birds with\\nwhite primary spots have the \\\"return margin.\\\"\\nThere are several birds of both sexes at hand with more or less\\nindication of red at the tips of the tail feathers. This is never at all\\nconspicuous, and is usually confined to the shaft of the feather at the\\nextreme tip. In one or two instances the color spreads out over the\\nadjoining vane, but without any coalescing of the red colored barbs;\\nnot one bird in the series has any well defined wax tips to the tail\\nfeathers similar to those on the secondaries. There is some variation\\nin the yellow tip to the tail feathers, both in intensity of yellow and\\nin the breadth of the marking. There are also some specimens with\\none or more tail feathers longer or shorter than the rest and of a\\ndifferent tone of yellow, giving the appearance of having been held\\nover from a previous plumage.\\nStevenson (loc. cit.) after careful study of the extensive series of\\nbirds at his disposal was unable to discover any external character distinguishing male from female, though he was inclined to believe '' that\\nthe assumption of the yellow tinge [on the primary markings] is probably more gradual in the female than in the male.\\\" The series before\\nthe present writer does not shed any additional light upon this question. Although there is considerable variation in the character of wing\\nand tail markings, it appears to be purely individual. It so happens\\nthat the brightest colored bird of the lot is a female (Mus. Vert. Zool.\\nno. 17437, sexed by C. I. Clay). In size (but not in number) of wax\\nwing tips, in \\\"return margins\\\" of primaries, in yellow on primaries,\\nand in size of white spots on secondaries, it is superior to any of the\\nmales. In this bird the wax secondary tips are 7 mm. in length, a size\\nattained by only one or two males.\\nThe brood of young birds we collected was naturally of more than\\nordinary interest. The nest was discovered on June 24, containing\\nfive young not more than two or three days old. On July 5 we returned. The nest was in a slender tree that swayed under the least\\npressure, and at the first disturbance the young birds fluttered to the\\nground. The brood was about two weeks old at this time. In two or\\nthree days more, at most, all would have left the nest voluntarily.\\nThe brood consisted of four males and one female.1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n279\\nThese young waxwings presented a most striking appearance in\\nlife, for to my surprise they exhibited all the characteristic markings\\nof the adult. Not only that, but the yellow tip to the tail was much\\nbrighter, more of an orange yellow, than it is in any of the old birds.\\nThe wax tips to the secondaries were present in each of the four males\\nbut not in the female. Two of the birds had four such tips, one had\\nfive, and one had seven, as many as are seen in any of the adults.\\nThese wax tips are as large as in many old birds. As rectrices' and\\nremiges were but partly grown out, the brightly colored tips occupied\\na much greater proportion of the whole than is the case in fully feathered birds. The resulting color effect was most bizarre. The young,\\nwith their remarkably vivid markings, looked utterly unlike the soberly\\ncolored adults.\\nThe four young males are very much alike in color and markings,\\nthe only differences in appearance being those arising from the slight\\ndifference in stage of development. The marginal primary markings\\nare present, sharply defined, and in each case bright yellow. In many\\nadults these markings are white. In the young males the terminal\\ntail band is orange-buff, the primary tips, light orange-yellow. In the\\nbrightest adult at hand the tail band is light cadmium, the primary\\ntips, lemon chrome. In the young female the tail band is somewhat\\npaler than in the males, though still more orange than in any adult..\\nThe primary tips are but slightly tinged with yellow.\\nA still more remarkable feature in the young males is the fact that\\nin each one the rectrices are distinctly tipped with red. These red\\ntips are not fully developed sealing-waxlike scales such as are on the\\nsecondaries, but are produced by red coloration of the terminal portion\\n(4 or 5 mm. in length) of the feather shaft of the rectrix.\\nThe female parent of this brood (the only one of the pair collected)\\nis a highly plumaged bird. It has six secondaries of one wing, five\\nof the other, with wax tips, the primary margins are bright yellow,\\nthe tail is broadly tipped with yellow, and there is a faint suggestion\\nof red in one or two of the tail feathers.\\nAs regards the young birds, it is seen that they possess all the\\npeculiar markings of the most brightly colored adults except the j' return margin\\\" upon the primaries. This is not seen in any of the\\nyoung. The yellow wing and tail markings are much brighter than in\\nany adult at hand, even than in freshly molted birds with these feathers\\nbut partly grown. While the young birds possess all the markings of\\nthe adults, they are appreciably different in general body color.   They\\n\\u2022It   I280\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol.\\n\\u25a0ft I 'riJ 4\\u00ab>\\n19'\\nPf\\nI tilt\\nit\\nhave a somewhat streaked appearance, though not as much so as in\\nthe young cedar waxwing, the whole body is of a duller, darker gray\\nthan in the adult, and the young bird has none of the vinous coloring\\nabout the head that is seen in the adult. The crest is present but only\\nslightly developed. The young has a dull black line from the nostril\\nto the eye and posteriorly on the head, in resemblance to that on the\\nadult, but in our specimens of young there is just an indication of the\\nblack throat. This may be due to the fact that in these birds the\\nfeathers of chin and upper throat are but partly developed, but appearances would indicate that in the fully acquired juvenal plumage\\nthe throat is whitish, bordered on each side by a line of dull black.\\nThe middle of the belly is whitish, the under tail coverts a paler and\\nduller chestnut than in the adult. One feature in which the young\\nwaxwings differ notably from the adults is the color of the inside of\\nthe mouth. This was a bright reddish (spinel pink of Ridgway) with\\na short, sharply defined streak of Mathews purple on each side, at the\\ncorner of the mouth. In adults the inside of the mouth is flesh color\\nwith but a suggestion of bluish at either side on the roof of the mouth.\\nIn the young birds, the iris is dark. In adults there is a narrow but\\ndistinct red ring surrounding the black pupil.\\nAlthough the fact that the young Bohemian waxwing possesses\\npractically all the distinctive markings of the most highly developed\\nadult was a surprise to the writer when the birds were first encountered in the field, it is not new in ornithological literature. There\\nhave been a few juvenals collected, but although their appearance has\\nbeen commented upon at the time of capture, apparently the compilers\\nof the more general handbooks have never cited these scanty specimens as representative of the usual condition. Casual mention of an\\nearly streaked stage, \\\"similar to that of the cedar bird,\\\" is the information usually given. Wolley's description of a young bird, in his\\naccount of the first discovery of the nesting of the European subspecies, is as follows:\\nA young bird caught on the 5th of August, as it fluttered from the nest, had\\na general resemblance to the adult, though all the colours were more dull. The\\nwax-like ends to the wing-feathers, the yellow tip to the tail, the black patch\\nbetween the eye and the beak are all there, whilst the rich mahogany of the\\nunder tail-coverts is of a quieter brown; the blooming vinous colour of the head\\nand back has not yet emerged from a homely neutral, and the crest is but just\\nindicated by the longish feathers of the crown. The most marked difference\\nbetween the adult and young is in the throat and under surface generally.\\nThere is at present scarcely a trace of the deep black patch of the chin, and the\\ndelicate tint of the general under surface of the adult is replaced by mottled1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        281\\nneutral and white. This upon examination is found to owe its appearance to\\nthose longer webs, which arising towards the root of each feather, extend as\\nfar outwards as the webs which arise nearer its tip, being very pale or white,\\nand thus relieving, on both sides, the last mentioned darker webs (Wolley, 1857,\\np. 56).\\n-In Gould's \\\"Birds of Great Britain\\\" there is a colored plate figuring adult birds, a nest, and five young. Of the young, three show\\nthe back and wings, all with wax tips to the secondaries. These figures\\nare from young taken by Dresser, July 4, 1858, but although five\\njuveniles are figured, in the text the statement is made that four\\nyoung were in the nest and just two were caught. (Gould, 1873, vol.\\nI pi. 21.)\\nBishop (1900a, p. 89) describes three fully fledged young from the\\nYukon region as having the waxlike appendages to the secondaries,\\nbut of a paler red than in the adult. One of these same young birds\\nis described in detail by Ridgway (1904, p. 106). Evidently but few\\nyoung birds of this species have been collected. Judging from those\\nthat have been taken, the waxlike secondary tips occur as frequently\\nin the juvenal plumage as in the later stages. In fact, with respect-\\nto all the variable features in this species, wax tips, white or yellow\\nwing markings, and yellow tail band, it is not possible to detect any\\ncorrelation between the extent of these markings or the intensity of\\ntheir color, and either age, sex, or season. We have, as described, birds\\nin juvenal plumage as brightly marked as any adult. The fact that\\nin the brood of five collected the four males have the wax tipping and\\nthe one female lacks these appendages, gives the appearance of this\\nbeing a sexual feature. To offset this, the female parent of this brood\\nhad the wax tips fully developed. Then, the female parent of a set\\nof five eggs, taken the same day, has the wax tips almost entirely\\nlacking.\\nIn commenting upon the Bohemian waxwing as a winter visitant\\nto Montana, where they were abundant, Cameron (1908, p. 46) says:\\nOnly a small proportion had yellow primary bands; in the great majority\\nthese were white. Most birds had no red sealing wax appendages visible and\\nwere presumably the young of the year. Others, besides showing white edging\\nto the ends of all the primaries except the two first, had four wax tips on the\\nsecondaries. These may have been birds of eighteen months old which had\\nmoulted twice, having regard to the fact that the waxwing moults only once a\\nyear\\u2014in October. A few of the birds had brilliant yellow wing-bars and\\nnumerous vermilion appendages, and I concluded that this small minority were\\nold birds.\\n!\\u25a0 ,\\n1\\nw\\n1\\nw,\\n11  '282\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\nirlli\\nliiil\\nSimilar lines of reasoning have been followed regarding other birds\\nthan the waxwing; that is, different types of plumage have been taken\\nas indicating different ages, rather than descriptions of plumages\\nbeing based upon specimens whose ages had been definitely ascertained in other ways. There is probably hardly a species where it\\nwould seem a more obvious or safer thing to do than to judge the\\nage of a waxwing from the number and size of the waxen wing tips,\\nyet inspection of the juvenal plumage shows how unsafe such assumptions may be.\\nThe most surprising statement in Cameron's account is the assertion that \\\"most birds had no red sealing wax appendages visible.\\\"\\nOf the forty-five adults, examined in the present connection only one\\nlacks any trace of such an appendage, and except for Cameron's comment I should have believed that it was unusual for a Bohemian waxwing to lack these ornaments. In the smaller cedar waxwing the case\\nis different. An examination of the latter species as represented in\\nthis Museum discloses 36 specimens with more or less wax tips to the\\nsecondaries, and 41 without a vestige of such marking. Judging from\\nthe material at hand, therefore, this character seems to be much more\\nfully developed in Bombycilla garrula than in B. cedrorum.\\nThe flocking instinct is strong in the waxwing at all times. The\\nnests we found, at two different localities, while not sufficiently close\\ntogether to merit the term '' rookeries,'' were gathered in close proximity, and to the exclusion of surrounding areas apparently just as\\nwell adapted to the purpose. The birds obviously prefer to nest in\\nfairly close company. When a sitting bird left the nest for the short\\ntime necessary to feed each day, it was to join one or two others and\\ndo the foraging in company. While both birds of a mated pair work\\nat nest construction, apparently all the labor of incubation falls upon\\nthe female. Her mate, thrown upon his own resources, usually joined\\nsome other unoccupied male. Usually two males fed together; occasionally there were more in company. Flocks were noted all through\\nthe breeding season, usually of not more than twelve or fifteen individuals; by the end of July gatherings were seen that were several\\ntimes as large.\\nIn nest building, male and female worked together. Dixon (MS)\\nobserved one pair at their labors for some time and made the following notes: After the observer had taken his station the female arrived\\nwith some white plant fiber. She put this fiber in place, and then, sitting in the nest, she turned around and around, shaping thus, with her\\nbreast, the nest cavity.   Then the male arrived with more of the plant1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n283\\nfiber. He placed it within reach of the female, who proceeded to weave\\nit into the structure. The birds worked so assiduously that the nest\\nwas nearly finished by noon of the. second day after it was begun.\\nIn approaching and leaving the birds were usually together. Instead of flying directly to the nest they generally lit in some nearby\\ntrees, then approached unobtrusively by several short flights through\\nthe thicket. In departing similar precautions were used. When\\nperching they almost invariably chose a tree top or some elevated and\\nprojecting limb. This was especially noticeable in birds disturbed at\\ntheir nests, and it was also the manner in which they perched when\\nengaged in flycatching activities.\\nDifferent birds varied in the degrees of tameness they showed about\\nthe nests. The female of the first set taken remained upon the eggs\\nuntil the collector's hand was within a few inches of her. Male and\\nfemale together hovered about for a few minutes, occasionally uttering\\nthe usual call note, and raising and lowering the crest. Then they\\nleft and did not return at all in the two hours that we remained in\\nthe vicinity.\\nA sitting bird when closely approached invariably pointed the bill\\nalmost straight up, and kept the crest closely pressed to the head. The\\nyoung birds frightened from the nest resorted to the same tactics. On\\none occasion One of a pair of waxwings, presumably the male, was seen\\nstrutting about and exhibiting his beauties to his mate. Considering\\nthat the two sexes are alike in every respect, it seemed rather a\\nsuperfluous performance, but at any rate the one bird was hopping\\nexcitedly about from branch to branch, while the other sat still and\\nlooked on. The active performer kept the tail partly spread, wings\\ndrooping, and crest raised, and the whole body was held stiffly upright.\\nAfter several minutes the other seemed to tire of the performance and\\nflew away, followed at once by its mate.\\nWaxwings were seen feeding on insects and also on berries and other\\nvegetable matter. About Telegraph Creek, the first week in June, they\\nwere usually seen perched on bare branches and making short sallies\\nafter flying insects in true flycatcher style. Early in July a berry-\\nbearing shrub (Shepherdia canadensis) of general distribution in the\\nregion came into bearing, and the waxwings, as well as other species of\\nbirds, fed upon the berries of this plant to a great extent. The young\\nwaxwings we took from the nest had also been fed upon these same\\nberries.\\nUnder ordinary circumstances the only sound uttered by the waxwing is a sibilant call note much like that of the more familiar cedar\\n1\\nHI284\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [Vol. 24\\n\\u25a0 111-\\nlljlli-\\nbird. While notes of the two species are of the same character, still they\\nare distinguishably different. This difference may, perhaps, be indicated\\nby describing the cedar bird's call as a hiss, the Bohemian waxwing's\\ncall as a buzz. The note of the latter is somewhat coarser; the listener\\nhas an impression of hearing a series of very slightly separated notes,\\nrather than of a continuous sound such as the cedar bird utters. The\\ncall note has been commented upon by Cameron (1908, p. 47), who\\nsays: \\\"When flying the birds keep up an incessant twittering, so that\\nhigh passing flocks are immediately recognized by their call of zir-r-r-r\\n\\u2014a sort of trill.\\\"\\nGriseom and Harper (1915, p. 369) make the following comments\\nupon the waxwing's call: \\\"Though similar in general form to the\\n'beady notes' of B. cedrorum, they are less shrill, are more leisurely\\nuttered, and have a more noticeable rolling sound. They are also more\\ndistinct, there being a comparatively greater interval between each\\nsyllable in the series. The call has been represented by Seebohm as\\ncir-ir-ir-ir-re (quoted in Sharpe's 'Hand-book to the Birds of Great\\nBritain,' Vol. I, p. 177) and by Cameron as zir-r-r-r . . . . , but\\nneither rendering seems to express exactly the decided sibilant quality\\nof each syllable.\\\"\\nE. M. Anderson (19156, p. 146) makes a rather surprising statement regarding the voice of the waxwing. \\\"While on the wing the\\nbirds uttered a short succession of high-pitched, screaming notes,\\nclosely resembling in character, though not in volume, the cries heard\\non nearing a Pigeon Guillemot rookery on the seacoast.\\\" As far as\\nI am aware this is the only published statement that ascribes to the\\nwaxwing any note other than the well-known hissing sound.\\nA bird shot by the present writer, which fell to the ground wounded,\\nuttered a loud, chattering noise, the only time I ever heard anything\\nof the kind. The young birds we removed from the nest called a great\\ndeal. One of the five fluttered off into the bushes where he escaped\\nobservation, but he soon began calling and was thus discovered. According to Dixon's notes at the time, the call note of the young waxwing was much like that of a young California shrike.\\nThe American waxwing was given the name Bombycilla garrula\\npallidiceps by Reichenow (1908, p. 191), with the type locality the\\nShesly River, northern British Columbia. The Shesly River, a tributary of the Inklin, which in turn empties into the Taku, has its source\\nsome twenty-five miles northwest of Telegraph Creek, its mouth,\\nsome sixty miles beyond. Thus for all practical purposes our Telegraph Creek specimens of the waxwing may be regarded as topotypes.1922\\n]        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n285\\nI had the opportunity of comparing a selection of these skins with\\nEuropean examples of B. g. garrula in the United States National\\nMuseum. The color differences distinguishing the two forms were\\nreadily apparent in the series thus brought together, and the differences appear to me to be sufficiently pronounced to justify the recognition of the American subspecies, pallidiceps. (Cf. Oberholser, 1917c,\\np. 333.)\\nWe collected seventeen specimens of the waxwing, nine adult males,\\nthree adult females, four juvenal males, and one juvenal female (nos.\\n40123-40139).\\nVireosylva gilva swainsoni (Baird).

When we arrived at Flood\\nGlacier, July 26, the species was present in some abundance; at the\\ntime of our departure, August 8, the birds were nearly all gone.\\nWhether or not this vireo breeds at the last mentioned locality was\\nnot definitely ascertained, but I am inclined to think that it does,\\njudging from the actions of certain individuals. On July 31 a pair\\nof the birds spent nearly the whole day in an alder thicket near our\\ncamp, scolding continually at some disturber of their peace that I\\ncould not discover. Possibly an owl was roosting near-by. Anyway,\\nthe vireos acted much as though they were concerned over the safety\\nof their brood.\\nAt Great Glacier, August 10, two were seen. This was the latest\\ndate of occurrence, and Great Glacier the westernmost locality at\\nwhich the species was noted. Our several points of record apparently\\nconstitute the farthest known extension of the range of this subspecies toward the northwest. It is not included by Anderson (1915a)\\nin his list of birds from Lake Atlin, some two hundred miles north\\nof Telegraph Creek. The occurrence at Great Glacier carries the\\nrange to within ten miles of the Alaskan boundary, and to within\\nabout thirty miles of the coast.\\nFive adult specimens were collected, two from the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, one from Doch-da-on Creek, one from Flood Glacier,\\nand one from Great Glacier (nos. 40140-40144). These birds are in\\nno wise to be distinguished from others from more southern points\\nin the range of the subspecies, as in California.\\nI \\u2022 \\\\\\nI';286\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\niim\\nlira\\nU llSli\\nVermivora celata orestera Oberholser.   Rocky Mountain Orange-\\ncrowned Warbler\\nWarblers of this species are rare in the upper Stikine Valley, or\\nelse they are so secretive during the nesting season as to avoid observation.   Two males (nos. 40145, 40146) were taken near Telegraph Creek\\non May 27 and 31, respectively, probably migrants, and no more were\\nseen for some time.   At Doch-da-on Creek, July 18, when many birds\\nwere beginning to move about after the close of the nesting season, a\\nfemale in juvenal plumage (no. 40147) was obtained.   Another young\\nbird, molting into first winter plumage  (no. 40148)  was taken at'\\nGreat Glacier, August 11.\\nThe two adults, compared with Vermivora celata lutescens of the\\ncoast region, are of greater size and duller coloration. Compared\\nwith V. c. celata, they are more yellowish, and lack the grayish tinge\\nof that race. Thus they exhibit the characters ascribed to Vermivora\\ncelata orestera Oberholser (1905, p. 242; 19176, p. 326). The juvenals\\nmay be distinguished from young lutescens by their gray juvenal\\nfeathers, yellow in the latter race.\\nII Li v.\\nil'iliS1!\\nVermivora celata lutescens (Ridgway). Lutescent Warbler\\nAn immature' male just finishing the molt from the juvenal\\nplumage (no. 40149) was taken at Great Glacier, August 11. At\\nSergief Island some were seen almost daily, evidently migrating and\\nusually in company with other transient warblers and kinglets. Five\\nspecimens were taken, all immature, on dates ranging from August 18\\nto September 22 (nos. 40150-40154).\\nVermivora peregrina (Wilson). Tennessee Warbler\\nMet with on but one occasion. On June 12, at a point some five\\nmiles southwest of Telegraph Creek, my attention was drawn to an\\nunfamiliar, wheezy song, heard at the edge of a swamp. The singer\\nwas discovered flitting from one twig to another in rather slow, vireo-\\nlike manner, giving his song at frequent intervals. It proved to be an\\nadult male Tennessee warbler, and was undoubtedly nesting near-by.\\nThis specimen (no. 40155) was the only one taken or observed, although\\nI kept careful watch for the species from that time on.19221\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        287\\nDendroica aestiva aestiva (Gmelin).   Eastern Yellow Warbler\\nA few seen near Telegraph Creek on May 26 were the first observed, but the species may have arrived some days earlier. The first\\nweek in June the birds were abundant and quite generally distributed\\nthrough the lower valleys. The males were especially noticeable from\\ntheir habit of perching at the tops of dead and leafless trees, and there\\nsinging. The loud song and brilliant color, with no concealing verdure round about, rendered them as conspicuous as such small birds\\ncould well be. On June 14 a set of three slightly incubated eggs was\\ntaken (no. 1822). The nest was in a cottonwood sapling, some twelve\\nfeet from the ground, at the edge of a dense thicket.\\nAt Doch-da-on Creek, the latter part of July, yellow warblers were\\nfairly numerous, and apparently on the move. At Flood Glacier,\\nearly in August, and at Great Glacier, about the middle of the month,\\nthey were seen frequently, though not in such numbers as had been\\npresent farther up the river.\\nEighteen specimens of yellow warbler were collected at points\\non the Stikine River (nos. 40156-40173). The series comprises six\\nadult males and three adult females from Telegraph Creek, three adult\\nmales from Glenora, one juvenal female from Doch-da-on Creek, and\\none adult female and four immature females from Flood Glacier.\\nDendroica aestiva rubiginosa is commonly considered as occupying\\nboth the coast and the interior of Alaska and northern British\\nColumbia (see A. 0. U. Committee, 1910, p. 311; Ridgway, 1902,\\np. 514; E. M. Anderson, 1915a, p. 16), but on how extensive a representation of specimens these opinions were based I do not know. My\\nStikine River series is certainly sufficiently different from the coastal\\nbird to forbid the two lots from being considered of the same subspecies. The series of rubiginosa in the collection of this Museum\\nincludes thirteen adult males from Vancouver Island and southeastern\\nAlaska. These birds are distinguished in color from other North\\nAmerican races of Dendroica aestiva primarily by the combination\\nof dark dorsal coloration, paler yellow underparts, and narrow and\\nscanty chestnut streaking below. The Telegraph Creek birds do not\\nfit into this category at all. In this series the underparts are more\\nbrilliantly yellow, and the chestnut streaks, are, in most of the specimens, numerous, broad, and conspicuous. As a series the lot fits in\\nabsolutely with D. aestiva aestiva, in regard to ventral coloration.\\nIn dorsal coloration they average somewhat darker than is the case\\nin an equally extensive series of eastern examples of aestiva, though288\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\nM\\nlllli-1\\nselections can be made of closely similar specimens in the two series.\\nThe variation in dorsal coloration is, I believe, at least partly due to\\ndifferent degrees of wear and fading of the feathers. Specimens of\\nthe two series that were taken at approximately the same dates are\\npractically indistinguishable. Measurements of the three lots are\\ngiven below.   They are of little diagnostic importance.\\nIn my opinion the Stikine River birds should not be classed with\\nrubiginosa. They present certain differences in appearance; and in\\nhabitat and migration they are as sharply set off from the coastal\\nbirds as is the case with practically all the other bird species of the\\nregion where they were taken. On our trip down the river I watched\\nfor yellow warblers carefully and purposely, and they are rather\\nmore conspicuous in migration than most small birds. The frequently\\nuttered zip-zip, as they fly from bush to bush, attracts attention, and\\nthe yellow color is easily seen. At Doch-da-on Creek, at Flood Glacier,\\nand at Great Glacier, yellow warblers were in evidence, obviously\\nmigrating, but below Great Glacier I could not see that there were\\nany traveling down stream. My belief is that they find an outlet\\nthrough the mountains to the southward, and that they do not reach\\nthe coast. When we reached Sergief Island, in the habitat of the\\ncoastal race (Dendroica aestiva rubiginosa), yellow warblers abruptly\\nbecame scarce. We saw very few, whereas this island was directly in\\nthe line of travel down the river. During the first two weeks of our\\nstay, the latter part of August, none was seen. On September 1 several were noted in company with other migrating warblers, and on\\nSeptember 2 a single bird was observed.\\nOn both scores, of physical characters and of distribution, I regard\\nthe yellow warblers of the upper Stikine River as best referred to\\nDendroica aestiva aestiva., showing some variation toward rubiginosa. Females and immature birds do not show the subspecific characters as do the adult males, and such of the former as were collected\\nat Flood Glacier and Great Glacier are ascribed to aestiva on the\\ngrounds of probability.\\nTABLE XI\\nMeasurements in millimeters  (average, minimum and maximum) of Dendroica\\naestiva aestiva and Dendroica aestiva rubiginosa\\nWing Tail\\nDendroica a. aestiva     10 males1   62.3 (60.0-64.0)    43.9 (42.0-46.0)\\nDendroica a. aestiva       9 males2   62.4 (60.5-64.0)    44.5 (42.5-46.5)\\nCulmen\\n9.6 (9.0-10.0)\\n9.3 (8.5-10.0)\\nDendroica a. rubiginosa 10 males3   61.5(59.5-64.0)   43.6(42.0-46.0)    9.7(9.0-10.0)\\n1Ontario, Canada, 4; Wisconsin, 4; Michigan, 2.\\n^Telegraph Creek, 7; Glenora, 2.\\n\\u2022Prince William Sound, Alaska, 2; Sitka, 1; Chickamin River,\\ns.e.

Alaska Myrtle Warbler\\nApparently not common in this region, though some were seen at\\neach collecting station. At the Junction the species was first seen on\\nMay 28. Two females taken on May 29 were evidently not breeding;\\nfrom their actions, these birds and others seen the same day were as\\nyet not even paired. To all appearances they had just arrived. None\\nwas seen in the immediate vicinity of Telegraph Creek, but a few\\npairs were encountered at scattered points some miles away. A few\\nwere seen at Glenora. At Doch-da-on Creek, July 8 to 25, small flocks\\noccasionally appeared, sometimes a single family, sometimes evidently\\ncomposed of two or more broods. The species undoubtedly nests at\\nthat point. Whether or not it nests at Flood Glacier, our next station\\ndown stream, is questionable, though I should think it likely that a\\nfew pairs might extend that far. Several specimens were taken there,\\nand others were seen, some each day. At Great Glacier, August 9\\nto 16, Hoover warblers were seen frequently, migrating then and\\nevidently traveling down stream. At the time of our arrival at Sergief\\nIsland, at the mouth of the river, on August 17, there were none of\\nthese warblers present. The first was obtained there on August 30,\\nand in the next day or two the birds were arriving in considerable\\nnumbers.\\nWe found no nests. Not many of the birds were seen under such\\ncircumstances that it seemed profitable to make search, and when\\nwe did attempt to watch individuals that were obviously nesting\\nnear-by the results were fruitless. For one thing, the suspects we\\nselected invariably dropped all other interests in order to follow us\\nabout, and, each time, the warbler we were watching proved able to\\nsit around doing nothing longer than we ourselves cared to.\\nThe first young bird was collected on June 18, and others in juvenal\\nplumage were taken at later dates, to July 10. One taken at Doch-\\nda-on Creek, July 22, is well advanced in the molt into first winter\\nplumage; another from Great Glacier, August 14, has just begun\\nthis change. One from Sergief Island, September 1, still retains\\nmuch of the juvenal plumage. It is interesting to note that this bird\\nprobably traveled some distance from its birthplace while undergoing\\nthe molt.

A male shot August 2 shows the first\\nindication of the postnuptial molt. This is evident only in the flight\\nfeathers, the first primary and the adjoining secondary of each wing\\nbeing partly grown out.   No adults were taken at a later date.\\nThis species is one of the few that migrates coastward at the close\\nof the breeding season. There is probably a movement directly southward east of the coast mountains also, but there is no doubt but that\\nthere is a regular late-summer line of travel down the Stikine River\\nto the coast. The birds were noted traveling down stream, and the\\narrival of the species at Sergief Island was in sufficient numbers to\\nwarrant the movement being regarded as of regular annual occurrence.\\nSimilar conditions have been noted in the late summer at the mouth of\\nthe Taku River, another large stream flowing from the interior to the\\ncoast, and emptying about one hundred and fifty miles north of the\\nmouth of the Stikine River (see Swarth, 1911, p. 99). There is no\\ninformation at hand regarding a return in the spring through the same\\nregions.\\nTwenty specimens were collected (nos. 40174-40193), the series\\ncomprising four adult males, seven adult females, six in juvenal\\nplumage, and three in first winter plumage. These were assembled\\nwith other material in this Museum for comparison with the eastern\\nDendroica c. coronata. Gomparable material in the tw_o subspecies\\ncomprised, of coronata, 14 adult (summer) males, 10 adult (summer)\\nfemales, 4 immature (first winter) ; of hooveri, 13 adult (summer)\\nmales, 15 adult (summer) females, 11 immature (first winter). There\\nare also midwinter and juvenal specimens of hooveri, stages at which\\nthere are no comparable specimens of coronata available.\\nJudging from this material, the subspecies Dendroica c. hooveri is\\nbut faintly characterized. As claimed by the original deseriber\\n(McGregor, 1899, p. 32), hooveri averages slightly larger than coronata (see table), but there is much overlapping in measurements. I,\\nmyself, am unable to perceive most of the differences of color and\\nmarkings that have been said to characterize the two subspecies.\\nMcGregor (loc. cit.) claimed differences in measurements only. Bishop (1900a, p. 90) advanced certain color characters, found in a series\\ncollected by himself in Alaska, notably in the summer plumage of the\\nadult male. He says: \\\"Adult males average paler below than typical\\nD. coronata, the black markings being narrower, thus giving an effect\\nof broad longitudinal markings rather than black clouding on the\\nchest.\\\"    This statement is endorsed by Grinnell  (19096, p. 235).1922]\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n291.\\nBishop (loc. cit.) claims further that there are color differences in the\\njuvenal plumage. Oberholser. (19186, p. 465) upholds the validity of\\nhooveri, asserting \\\"that it differs from Dendroica coronata coronata\\nnot only in its larger size but in the coloration of male, female, and\\neven young.\\\" Ridgway (1902, p. 548, footnote) and Riley (1912,\\np. 70) each refuse recognition to hooveri.\\nThe series assembled by myself in the present connection demonstrates the average size, differences claimed to exist. I fail to appreciate\\nany differences whatsoever of color or pattern between adult males\\nand females of the two lots. The juvenal plumages I have been unable\\nto compare.

Next encountered at Flood Glacier, where, on August 4,\\na bird was caught in a mouse trap. The fall migration was then\\nsetting in, and a few days later, at Great Glacier, pileolated warblers\\nwere noted from time to time with other migrating warblers. At\\nSergief Island, the latter part of August they were seen almost daily,\\nthe last on September 1.\\nSix specimens were collected (nos. 40208-40213), two adult males\\nand one adult female from the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, an immature (sex not determined) from Flood Glacier, and an immature\\nmale and immature female from Great Glacier. These specimens, in\\nmy opinion, are all referable to the subspecies pileolata. The three\\nTelegraph Creek adults are slightly darker and duller colored throughout than coastal birds, and to that extent, presumably, lean toward\\npusilla, but they are not so dark colored as eastern specimens of that\\nsubspecies. In measurements they do not differ from coastal pileolata.\\nWith the material at hand it is not possible to tell whether the im-\\nmatures collected in August at Flood Glacier and Great Glacier are\\nmigrants from the inferior or from the coast.

From the\\nactions of the birds seen on that date and the number that were\\nobserved, it seemed as though they might have arrived some time previously, but the same ground had been traversed two days before\\nwithout any redstarts being seen or heard. From this time on the song\\nof this species was heard by us practically everywhere we went in the\\npoplar woods of the lowlands. Males in the plumage of the female,\\nsupposed to be birds of the previous year, sang just as did those in the\\nbrilliant black and orange livery. That the dull feathered males were\\nbreeding was shown in one instance in the capture of a mated pair,\\nevidently preparing to nest. This was on June 15.

At Glenora, during the first week in July, full-grown young\\nwere collected, from flocks formed by the junction of two, sometimes\\nof three, families.

Where the long-tailed chickadee appears to be most at home is in rather open and sunny poplar woods.\\nSeveral small flocks were seen at Great Glacier, August 9 to 16,\\nbut again it does not seem likely that the species had been nesting\\nthere. The Great Glacier is only about ten miles from the British\\nColumbia-Alaska boundary, so that it is probable that the long-tailed\\nchickadee occurs at times quite to the mouth of the river.\\nThe nest discovered near Telegraph Creek was in a tract of rather\\nopen woods, mostly of small poplars.

In approaching the\\nnest, the old birds came through the trees and bushes until within1922 ]        Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n297\\nabout eight or ten feet of their destination; then they dropped to the\\nground and hopped to the entrance. To the casual observer they disappeared at a point some distance from the nest, and it was not until\\nthey had been observed for some time that this subterfuge was detected.\\nThe staple food that was being brought to the young was a small green\\ncaterpillar infesting the poplars at that time; also a white grub, a\\ngreen katydid, and many mosquito-like insects.\\nThirty specimens were collected (nos. 40235-40264), six adults,\\neighteen in juvenal plumage, and six in various stages of the molt from\\njuvenal to first winter plumage. Two of the latter category, from\\nGreat Glacier, August 12, have nearly finished the change. The birds\\nof this series, in color and size, exhibit the characters ascribed to the\\nsubspecies septentrionalis, that is, as regards differentiation from the\\neastern atricapillus. Within the rather extensive habitat of septentrionalis there appears to be some variation in color, perhaps enough\\nto separate the Stikine River birds as distinguishably darker colored\\nthan typical septentrionalis. A few specimens at hand from the middle\\nwest suggest this possibility, but there is not enough material available\\nto verify the supposition. The buffy coloration on the sides and flanks\\nappears to be an extremely evanescent character, conspicuously present in the fresh fall plumage, but absent in breeding adults (in which\\nthis same plumage has been subject to several months of wear). In\\nvery young birds (nestlings) it is strongly apparent, but in juvenals\\nthat could have been out of the nest no more than a month it has\\nalmost entirely vanished.\\n;h\\nPenthestes gambeli abbreviatus Grinnell.\\nChickadee\\nShort-tailed Mountain\\nThe limited opportunities we had for observation of this bird did\\nnot suffice to demonstrate its ecological relationships with P. atricapillus septentrionalis. That is, as regards choice of local habitats of\\nthe two\\u2014an interesting point where two such closely related species\\nof one genus occur in the same general region. Septentrionalis, as\\npreviously remarked, strongly favors the poplar woods, and other\\nsubspecies of the species atricapillus are known as denizens of\\ndeciduous forests elsewhere. The species gambeli, on the other hand,\\nis largely an inhabitant of coniferous woods, and it seems likely that\\nin the Stikine region P. gambeli abbreviatus makes its summer home\\namid the spruce and balsam of the higher mountain slopes, where we\\nnever  encountered P.  atricapillus septentrionalis.    At Doch-da-on298\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     [VoL-\\nCreek, at the end of the nesting season, small flocks of P. gambeli\\nabbreviatus were seen on several occasions; it was observed nowhere\\nelse. Five specimens were collected (nos. 40265-40269), four on\\nJuly 14 in woods at the river's edge, and one on July 23, on a mountain slope at about 3000 feet elevation, close to timber line. The\\nseries consists of two adults in extremely worn plumage, and three\\nin juvenal plumage. Oberholser (19196, p. 424) has reported the\\noccurrence of this subspecies at Thudade Lake, British Columbia.\\nThe present point of record is about two hundred miles northwest of\\nThudade Lake, and, in a direct line, about sixty miles from the coast.\\nIt must indicate about the extreme northwestern limit reached by this\\nbird.

From May 27 to June 4\\nseveral of the present species, apparently migrants, were observed at\\ndifferent times along the trail from Telegraph Creek to the Summit.\\nOur failure to find the species subsequently may, perhaps, have been\\nbecause the birds were breeding in the spruce timber of the higher\\nmountain slopes, to which we made but few visits. Several times I\\nthought I heard the sibilant call note of the golden-crowned kinglet in\\nsome dense timber above Doch-da-on Creek (at about 3000 feet altitude), in July, but I was unable to see the birds. At Flood Glacier,\\nAugust 7, one was seen in a mixed flock of migrating small birds, and\\nthere may have been others passing through at the time. Two specimens were collected during the summer, an adult male at the Junction,\\nMay 27 (no. 40279), and an adult female at Flood Glacier (no. 40280).19221\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region\\n299\\nRegulus calendula calendula (Linnaeus).

This\\nbird (no. 40281) is in very worn plumage, but, even so, there is no\\ndoubt that it does not belong to the coastal subspecies, R. calendula\\ngrinnelli. It is of a paler colored race of the interior.

At Sergief Island a single bird was seen on September 1. The four obtained are all young birds molting from juvenal\\ninto first winter plumage.   They are clearly of the subspecies grinnelli.\\nMyadestes townsendi (Audubon). Townsend Solitaire\\nFairly common at low altitudes in the upper Stikine Valley. There\\nwere at least three pairs nesting within half a mile of the town of\\nTelegraph Creek, and others were seen down the river as far as Doch-\\nda-on Creek. The solitaires had already reached the region when we\\narrived, on May 23; in fact, nesting activities must have been well\\nunder way by that time. On June 7 a nest was found containing five\\neggs, just hatching; the next morning it held three young birds. Two\\nof the eggs were apparently not fertile. This nest, close to town and\\nby the side of a road we traversed almost daily, was kept under observation until the family departed. On the morning of June 20 the\\nyoung were gone, having left since the previous evening.\\nThe nest was placed under the overhanging bank on the upper\\nside of a wood road. The slope was south facing and the nest well\\nexposed to the sun's rays. This exposure, advantageous as far as\\nwarmth was concerned, placed the bulky structure conspicuously in\\nview of anyone passing along the road, for there was no concealing\\nvegetation on the bare, dirt bank.300\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology     you 24\\nA second nest, in a somewhat similar situation, was discovered,\\nunfinished, on June 8. Both birds were around at that time, but they\\ndeserted this home before any eggs were laid.\\nThe solitaires did not sing much but the call note was uttered continually. From our rooms in town at Telegraph Creek, this was one\\nbird note that could be heard hour after hour, monotonously repeated\\nnearly the whole day through. To our ears it sounded so nearly like\\nthe distant barking of a California ground squirrel (CiteUus beecheyi)\\nthat the sound would surely have been disregarded as a bird call had\\nwe been in a region where the squirrels occur.\\nFig. FF. Townsend soKtaire (Myadestes townsendi) on nest. This nest was\\nplaced in a cut bank at the side of a road, a southern exposure that received the\\nfull benefit of the sun's rays. Photograph taken near Telegraph Creek, June 9,\\n1919.\\nAt Glenora, early in July, and at Doch-da-on Creek, toward the end\\nof the same month, solitaires were seen at intervals, single birds, and\\napparently migrating, though nearly all that were seen were still in\\nthe juvenal plumage. While none was observed by us any farther\\ndown the river, the capture of one at Wrangell on April 30, 1919, by\\nE. P. Walker (no. 41286) indicates the possible occurrence of the\\nspecies at any point in the Stikine Valley during the migrations.\\nTwo specimens were collected, a male and a female, both in juvenal\\nplumage, taken at Glenora on July 5 and 7, respectively (nos. 40286,\\n40287). Compared with Calif ornian birds at the same stage, the Stikine\\nRiver specimens show some difference in coloration.   The ground color1922\\nSwarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        301\\nof the upper parts in the northern birds is appreciably more gray, less\\nbuffy, and the spots are less yellowish. We obtained no adults, but\\nthe Wrangell adult, above mentioned, and others from the Rocky\\nMountain region farther south are not perceptibly different from the\\nCalifornian birds. The differences seen in the juvenals may be significant, but our material is not sufficient to demonstrate the fact.\\nHylocichla ustulata ustulata (Nuttall).   Russet-backed Thrush\\nThere were a very few individuals of this species still lingering in\\nthe region when we arrived at the. mouth of the Stikine River, about\\nthe middle of August. One was seen on Sergief Island, August 18,\\nand another on September 4, both in the alder thickets that surrounded\\nour camp. As neither one was taken, it is, of course, possible that the\\nbirds seen were of the subspecies swainsoni, rather than ustulata. Our\\nexperience on the Stikine disclosed the presence of swainsoni so far\\ndown the river that it would not be surprising if occasional individuals\\nshould wander quite to the coast during migration. However, as\\nSergief Island is within the known range of ustulata, while swainsoni\\nhas never yet been taken on the coast, it is proper to refer the records\\nfrom that point to the race known to occur there.\\nHylocichla ustulata swainsoni (Tschudi).   Olive-backed Thrush\\nOne of the commoner species of the upper Stikine Valley. First\\nnoted at the Junction on May 28; the next three days saw an influx\\nof considerable numbers. On May 31 the first song was heard, so\\nsimilar to the, to us, more familiar notes of the russet-backed thrush\\nas to be indistinguishable. On June 5 a female was shot, with eggs\\nbeginning to enlarge in the ovary, on June 9 one was taken which\\nhad laid part of its set, and on June 12 the first set of eggs was obtained. A young bird, just out of the nest, was taken at Glenora on\\nJuly 7, and full-grown juvenals were collected at Flood Glacier early\\nin August.\\nThis is a bird of the poplar woods and willow thickets of the lowlands, primarily, but we found it also in small numbers well up the\\nmountain sides. On July 17 Dixon saw several at the upper edge of\\nthe spruce timber (about 4000 feet) on the mountains above Doch-da-on\\nCreek.\\nNests found were all at the lower levels. The first discovered was\\nin fairly open woods, mostly of small willows, and in a very exposed\\nIII;\\nV ill302\\nUniversity of California Publications in Zoology      [VoL- 24\\nij'li':\\n1\\nsituation. The nest was about four feet from the ground, between\\nfour upright willow branches, and there was no concealing green\\ngrowth about it. The material used was mostly dried weed stems,\\ngrass, and shreds of bark. The lining differs from the Outer structure\\nonly in that it consists of finer material of the same sort. Dimensions\\nof this nest are as follows: greatest outside diameter, 170 mm.; inside\\ndiameter, 68; outside depth, 100; inside depth, 40. It contained four\\neggs, partly incubated.\\nA second nest was collected on June 19, essentially like the first\\nexcept that it is less bulky. This was in an alder, about four feet\\nfrom the ground, alongside a seldom used road, and again in a most\\nexposed situation. The set was of four eggs. On June 19 still another\\nnest was found, in a crotch in a dead willow, about eight feet up. In\\nthis one there are more and coarser bark strips used, and a good deal\\nof the cottony fiber from the fireweed pods. It contained five eggs.\\nThe last occupied nest was found at Doch-da-on Creek, July 21, containing three eggs nearly ready to hatch. This was in an alder, about\\nthree feet from the ground. In the case of the nest last described, the\\nparent bird, presumably the female, was in great distress and did not\\ngo very far away. With each of the others, the sitting bird slipped\\nunobtrusively away and did not return until some time had elapsed,\\nprobably never under twenty minutes.\\nAt Great Glacier, August 11, a young bird was collected, not yet\\nable to fly, that is clearly referable to swainsoni. This last record is\\nof considerable interest as it carries the breeding range of swainsoni\\nwestward in this region to a point about thirty miles from the coast,\\nthe habitat of Hylocichla u. ustulata. Although the habitats of the\\ntwo subspecies thus approach so closely, there is no evidence of intergradation of characters between them. In the Stikine River series of\\nswainsoni there is not one specimen of an equivocal character. On the\\ncontrary, these birds-, like those from the Yukon region, show an extreme- of grayness, compared with typical swainsoni from eastern\\nNorth America, that carries them farther from ustulata in appearance\\nthan are specimens from the Atlantic coast. (In this connection see\\nOberholser, 1898, p. 305.) It may be pointed out also that although\\nustulata and suminsoni breed in different parts of northern California,\\nthere is no section of that state that is known to be occupied by birds\\nof intermediate character. As in the Stikine region, both occur in\\ntypical form quite to the margins of their respective habitats. Thus,\\nif ustulata and swainsoni are to be regarded as two subspecies of one1922] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        303\\nspecies, it must be on the criterion of individual variation rather than\\non that of gradual blending through the population of contiguous\\nterritories. In the Stikine region the two forms occur, in the interior\\nand on the coast, respectively, and within a few miles of each other,\\nas distinct in appearance as any two species. On the other hand, as\\nregards song, nesting habits and eggs, these features all supply evidence to show close relationships between the two. In none of these\\nrespects is there any apparent difference.\\nTwenty-one specimens of the olive-backed thrush were collected\\n(nos. 40288-40308), fifteen adults and six young.\\nHylocichla guttata guttata (Pallas).   Alaska Hermit Thrush\\nThere were a few pairs nesting along Telegraph Creek to within a\\nmile or two of the Stikine, but mostly the birds were at higher elevations. None was seen in the immediate vicinity of Glenora or of\\nDoch-da-on Creek, but the species was encountered in spruce woods\\non the mountains above the latter point, at about 3000 feet altitude.\\nTwo nests were taken. The first (no. 1827) was found on May 23,\\nwith three eggs, and collected on May 26 with a set of five. It was in\\nthe creek bottom, about two miles north of the town of Telegraph\\nCreek, some three feet from the ground, in a spruce sapling. The nest\\nrested against the trunk and upon some small branches. The outer\\nstructure is of twigs, weed stems, rootlets and bark strips; the lining\\nis of fine rootlets and grass, with a good many of the long overhairs\\nof a porcupine. It measures as follows: greatest outside diameter\\nabout 160 mm.; outside depth, 90; inside diameter, 60; inside depth,\\n40 mm.\\nThe second nest (no. 1828) was taken June 4, with four slightly\\nincubated eggs. This was found near the Junction, four miles north\\nof Telegraph Creek, amid similar surroundings to the first one. It\\nwas placed between two small spruce trees, thirty inches from the\\nground. In general appearance and in details of structure, it is very\\nsimilar to the first one found, even to the porcupine hairs in the lining.\\nBoth were in situations where there was little concealing vegetation,\\nand were easily seen from some distance.\\nFive specimens, two males and three females, were collected between Telegraph Creek and the Summit (nos. 40309-40313). The\\nhermit thrush of this general region has been referred to Hylocichla\\nguttata sequoiensis by Ridgway (1907, p. 44) ; specimens from Atlin,\\ntwo hundred miles north of Telegraph Creek, have been recorded as304 University of California Publications in Zoology      you 24\\nsequoiensis (E. M. Anderson, 1915a, p. 17). I cannot agree with this\\ndetermination, as applied to the Telegraph Creek series. These birds\\nare not the same as the hermit thrush of the Sierra Nevada of California (sequoiensis). They are appreciably smaller than the latter\\nand they are not so gray. They come very close, both in color and\\nsize, to a series of guttata, from Prince William Sound, Alaska, being\\nperhaps a trifle paler colored.

Dwarf Hermit Thrush\\nThe hermit thrush appears to range the whole length of the Stikine\\nValley; it is one of the few species of whieh we found specimens at\\nintermediate points the characters of which indicate a likelihood of\\nintergradation in that region between the two unlike subspecies at the\\ntwo ends of the stream. A specimen taken at Flood Glacier on July 27\\n(no. 40314), an adult female not yet beginning to molt, is intermediate in color between the gray Telegraph Creek specimens and\\nthe dark colored birds of the coast. Despite the lateness of the season\\nand the consequent greater wear upon the plumage, it is still appreciably browner than the Telegraph Creek birds. On the whole, it\\nseems best regarded as nanus, though not typical of that form. A\\nyoung bird (no. 40315) from Great Glacier, August 11, in the juvenal\\nphimage throughout, is referred to nanus.1922 ] Swarth: Birds and Mammals of the Stikine Region        305\\nOn Sergief Island, hermit thrushes were fairly numerous up to\\nthe first week in September.

Eastern Robin\\nAt the time of our arrival at Telegraph Creek, robins were present\\nin full force.

On May 30 one\\nbird was seen carrying building material, but this must have been\\nrather late, for young were out of the nest on June 9. Robins were\\nfairly numerous at Glenora and at Doch-da-on Creek.

Call notes were heard on July 29, but\\nthe birds were not seen. At Great Glacier, too, there were very few\\naround. Two seen, but not obtained, on August 11, were the only\\nones noted.\\nNine specimens (nos. 40318-40326) were collected on the upper\\nStikine River, at Telegraph Creek, Glenora, and Doch-da-on Creek.\\nThe series comprises two adult males, five adult females, and two\\njuvenals. These birds are referable to the eastern subspecies, Planesticus migratorius migratorius. The outer rectrices are conspicuously\\ntipped with white, which is not the case with the coast form, P. m.\\ncaurinus, a differentiating character that is readily apparent, even\\nin the live birds. The young from Telegraph Creek are of a differ-\\nentflsolor from the coast birds, being less brownish and more gray,\\nespecially on the upper parts.\\nJust how far down the river P. m. migratorius extends we did not\\ndefinitely ascertain, but, as noted above, robins wfere abundant as far\\ndown the river as Doch-da-on Creek, and abruptly became very scarce\\njust below there. A little below Doch-da-on Creek, and from that\\npoint down, forest conditions are such that it seems doubtful -that there\\nare many robins breeding anywhere along the lower river. While we\\nsaw and heard a few at Flood Glacier and Great Glacier,-we obtained\\nno specimens, so cannot be certain which subspecies occurs at those\\npoints.\\nPlanesticus migratorius caurinus Grinnell.   Northwestern Robin\\nFairly numerous at Sergief Island, though irregularly so, during\\nthe whole of our stay at that place, August 17 to September 7.

Northern Varied Thrush\\nThere were no varied thrushes in the immediate vicinity of Telegraph Creek, nowhere in the river valley at least. We were constantly\\non the lookout for them, and both the birds and the call notes are\\nsufficiently conspicuous to be readily detected by any one familiar\\nwith the species. Subsequent experience farther down the river leads\\nme to believe that they probably breed at higher altitudes throughout\\nthe region; we ourselves, found them at but one such station.\\nAt Glenora, early in the morning of July 1, the call note of a varied\\nthrush was heard distinctly, several times repeated. The bird was in\\nthick shrubbery at the river's edge, and could not be seen. It was\\nassumed to be a wandering individual, finished with family cares and\\nstraying from the breeding ground on the nearby mountains. On\\nJuly 11 a male varied thrush was seen on the mountain side above\\nDoch-da-on Creek, at about 3000 feet altitude. The bird was perched\\nhigh on a dead spruce stub, a hundred feet or more above the ground,\\nuttering at frequent intervals the disconnected notes comprising the\\nsong of this species. Later on others were seen or heard at about the\\nsame elevation.\\nOn July 18 a young bird was seen at the level of the Stikine River,\\nat Doch-da-on Creek, and from then on a few others were observed\\nfrom time to time. There were a few in the woods at Flood Glacier\\nand at Great Glacier, exceedingly wary and most difficult to see. Three\\nspecimens were collected at'Flood Glacier (nos. 40328-40330), an adult\\nmale and two juvenal females; and one at Great Glacier, an adult\\nfemale (no. 40331).

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "In years past the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology has conducted\n",
      "several expeditions to the coast of southeastern Alaska, covering in\n",
      "all a large part of that district, and one to Vancouver Island, British\n",
      "Columbia, nearby and of somewhat similar character.1 As one result\n",
      "of this field work the Museum has obtained a representative collection\n",
      "of the birds and mammals of this strongly characterized northwestern\n",
      "coast region of North America. Of the closely adjacent interior of\n",
      "British Columbia, however, the Museum contained no specimens\n",
      "whatever. •\n",
      "In a general way it has been understood that the faunas of the\n",
      "coast and of the interior are markedly different, that the boundary\n",
      "between the two is sharply defined, and that this boundary lies very\n",
      "near to the coast. It is obvious that collections could be made over a\n",
      "relatively limited area and still include a strip of country extending\n",
      "from the one region to the other. Such an expedition would supply\n",
      "series of specimens of species new to the Museum collections or but\n",
      "scantily represented therein, and would also provide valuable data\n",
      "regarding distribution, especially with respect to the behavior of animal\n",
      "forms at the margins of their habitats.\n",
      "The valley of the Stikine River seemed to satisfy all requirements.\n",
      "It crosses the boundary between the two f aunal areas, and, piercing the\n",
      "formidable barrier of mountains that intervenes, affords a feasible\n",

      "glance, in the field, there was no doubt in my mind that hyemalis\n",
      "was the form encountered. Comparison with eastern birds, however,\n",
      "shows certain appreciable differences. Connectens is darker colored\n",
      "throughout, and, compared with the more uniformly slaty hued\n",
      "hyemalis, is seen to possess a blackish head, quite sharply defined at a\n",
      "line above the shoulders. Beneath, in connectens, the outline of the\n",

309126 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 i introduction in years past the museum of vertebrate zoology has conducted several expeditions to the coast of southeastern alaska covering in all a large part of that district and one to vancouver island british columbia nearby and of somewhat similar character 1 as one result of this field work the museum has obtained a representative collection of the birds and mammals of this strongly characterized northwestern coast region of north america of the closely adjacent interior of british columbia however the museum contained no specimens whatever in a general way it has been understood that the faunas of the coast and of the interior are markedly different that the boundary between the two is sharply defined and that this boundary lies very near to the coast it is obvious that collections could be made over a relatively limited area and still include a strip of country extending from the one region to the other such an expedition would supply series of specimens of species new to the museum collections or but scantily represented therein and would also provide valuable data regarding distribution especially with respect to the behavior of animal forms at the margins of their habitats the valley of the stikine river seemed to satisfy all requirements it crosses the boundary between the two f aunal areas and piercing the formidable barrier of mountains that intervenes affords a feasible route from one region to the other furthermore we already had extensive series of birds and mammals from the country about the mouth of the river to supplement whatever collections might be made farther up stream dr j a allen 1903 had published a report upon a collection of mammals from the upper stikine region made by a j stone and m p anderson but this collection had been gathered to the eastward of the debatable strip that we especially desired to explore the expedition thus outlined was made possible through the generous provision by miss annie m alexander founder of the museum of vertebrate zoology of a sufficient sum to defray the cost this in i previous field work on the northwest coast has been prosecuted as follows in 1906 on the kenai peninsula in 1907 in the sitkan district in 1908 in the prince william sound region in 1909 in the sitkan district and in 1910 on vancouver island 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 127 addition to her regular yearly appropriation for the maintenance of the museum miss alexander had long been especially interested in the natural history of alaska and british columbia and had herself personally participated in previous field work carried on in those regions by this museum our party consisted of two the writer and mr joseph dixon economic mammalogist of the museum mr dixon collected most of the mammals and took entire charge of the photographic work making this an important feature of the trip he also supplied most of the notes regarding the nesting activities of various species of birds the writer collected most of the birds and worked with the mammals enough to enable him to better understand local conditions the material collected consists of 534 mammals 638 birds 24 sets of birds eggs mostly with nests 70 amphibians 195 photographic negatives the present report is concerned with the mammals and birds the amphibians are not included in treating the birds i have followed the nomenclature of the american ornithologists union check list 1910 and its supplements 1912 1920 with some modifications i have made no attempt to be up to date in the adoption of the scores of changes proposed of recent years not yet acted upon by the committee and regarding which i have no new facts to offer or upon which i cannot form an independent opinion there are certain cases however dealing mostly with matters of ornithology rather than nomenclature where the presentation of new facts or a new point of view or the conviction of the correctness of the course of some previous writer at variance with the check list impels me to the use of names not included in that standard this it seems to me is proper these changes are thus formally presented for consideration but their general adoption by others prior to action of the committee is not expected any more than i myself expect at once to adopt other changes regarding which i can have no personal knowledge i have endeavored in every case at variance with the check list to indicate my reason for adopting the name in question with mammals there is no such standard and the opinion of the latest monographer of a group is usually accepted my sincere acknowledgments are due to a number of institutions and individuals for aid of one sort or another for the prosecution of the field work i was generously granted by the following authorities permission to collect specimens of birds and mammals the united states biological survey and the dominion parks branch department128 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 of the interior canada for the taking of migratory birds the united states department of agriculture for game mammals in alaska the united states department of commerce for fur bearing mammals in alaska mr f kermode director of the provincial museum victoria british columbia for game and non game birds and mammals in british columbia i am under obligations to the bureau of biological survey of the united states department of agriculture through its chief dr e w nelson for the loan of specimens for the identification of certain species and for the determination of the contents of bird stomachs in this connection particular mention should be made of the identification of the shrews of the genera 8 or ex and microsorex by dr hartley h t jackson who examined all my material except four specimens in alcohol and of the examination of a considerable number of birds stomachs by mr charles c sperry from the victoria memorial museum ottawa through mr p a taverner and from the provincial museum victoria british columbia through the director mr f kermode i received the loan of specimens of various species of birds the plant names used in this report were supplied by dr f j smiley of the university of california herbarium based upon specimens collected on this expedition that have been deposited in the herbarium advice and information was received from mr ernest p walker an employee of the united states bureau of fisheries who was stationed at wrangell alaska at the time we were pursuing our field work in that region mr walker supplied data on certain species from the vicinity of wrangell and he has presented to the museum of vertebrate zoology specimens of birds and mammals from the same region that are desirable additions to the museum collection i take pleasure in expressing my gratitude to mr w h dodd government agent at telegraph creek for assistance and advice during our stay in the region over which he has jurisdiction 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 129 fig a map of the lower stikine river british columbia and alaska showing stations from which

localities from berkeley we proceeded directly to telegraph creek the head of navigation on the stikine river there we made arrangements with the barrington transportation company whereby their river boat running on fairly regular schedule deposited us at various selected camp sites our collecting stations were carefully chosen both with regard to their location on the river and to the accessibility of stretches of surrounding territory the last item is of importance in a wilderness as generally impenetrable as are the forests of the lower stikine our itinerary in detail was as

telegraph creek is on the north bank of the stikine river about 130 miles from and 540 feet above tidewater brooks 1906 p 49 it is about 160 miles from the general line of the coast at the mouth of the river following the course of the stream less than half that distance in an air line from the nearest point on the coast telegraph creek the stream flowing from the north empties into the river at this point near the town the river banks rise steeply on either side to a series of terraces beyond at many points these enclosing walls are sheer cliffs of basaltic rock several hundred feet high with long steep taluses extending below sometimes to the river s edge telegraph creek for the last mile or two of its course flows along a narrow canon the steep walls rising abruptly to the level terraces above in its upper reaches it follows a canon the walls of which are not particularly steep the stream has its source in a string of lakes at the summit some twelve miles north of the point where it empties into the stikine at an altitude of about 2600 feet the mountains rise to a much greater height on either side about two miles northwest of the town of telegraph creek is sawmill lake about a mile long four or five miles farther west lies the much larger alkali lake 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine regioi 131 in the telegraph creek region the principal feature of the vegetation is the poplar woods poplars grow everywhere in the lowlands sometimes in almost pure stands with but a sprinkling of other trees and for miles in extent in swampy places willow thickets form dense growths that are hard to penetrate on some of the drier ridges these willows form open woods that are quite easy to traverse composed of rather large trees widely spaced and with little brush below at some points there are stretches of dry gravelly benches with a sparse growth of small lodgepole pines pinus contorta and here and there a few cottonwoods birches and poplars with very little undergrowth and all together very park like in appearance fig b looking down the stikine river from a point about a mile below telegraph creek just above the junction of the first south fork the stikine today follows the same general course to the sea as it did before the present coastal ranges were elevated the river valley was cut deeper and deeper during the slow uplift of the mountain barrier in the telegraph creek region here shown the valley consists of a series of sharply defined terraces rising step by step from the river to the bases of the mountains on either side these terraces presumably indicate the level of the river at different periods of its history photograph taken june 24 1919 the valley on the north side of the river extending west and south at least as far as glenora is relatively level with a few low hills and ridges here and there stretching from the abrupt banks that border the river up to the higher mountains some miles to the northward this rolling country is nearly all covered with forest of poplar willow cottonwood and birch and a few scattered pines in places the woods are quite dense sometimes fairly open some of the hills and ridges are1 32 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 quite destitute of trees there are occasional small lakes and here and there marshes and small streams on the drier slopes and ridges two species of juniper occur juni perus communis var sibirica and jurdperus horizontalis both to be seen in abundance from the river bank up to the summit both species grow as rather low rounded bushes on the higher mountain slopes are groves of spruce and balsam fir extending downward in cool shaded canons as along telegraph creek or occurring sometimes as fig c east end of sawmill lake near telegraph creek mammals that especially frequent the grass and bushes about the shores of the lake are shrews sorex personatus personatus and s dbscwms ohscurus drummond meadow mouse and stikine jumping mouse

of the coast range and flows southerly and westerly to the pacific its headwaters interlock with those of the liard and with streams that flow into the yukon thus the height of land that traverses northern british columbia serves as a divide between several great river systems the liard flows northeastward through the rocky mountains to the mackenzie which flows into the arctic ocean the yukon flows north m ills142 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 westward to bering sea on the west the taku stikine and skeena rivers follow parallel courses westward through the coast range to the pacific headwaters of all these streams rise from nearby points in northern british columbia for some distance from its source the stikine flows from east to west following fairly closely the 58th parallel of latitude and receiving from time to time tributaries of considerable size in the telegraph creek region the river gradually turns first toward the southwest then almost due south some twenty miles from the coast about at the british columbia alaska boundary it bends sharply to the westward once more and reaches salt water near the town of wrangell amid the network of islands forming the alexander archipelago a tributary of importance to the upper stikine is clearwater creek entering from the northwest some thirty miles below telegraph creek near the boundary there is a small stream that is locally called j clearwater creek and there is apt to be confusion between the two if the facts are not known our work did not take us above the middle stikine valley with its uppermost limit at telegraph creek in this section from telegraph creek down stream nearly to doch da on creek the valley is rather broad the mountains rising at a distance on either side just south of doch da on creek the stikine begins its passage through the coast range the valley already much narrowed becomes still more constricted some five miles below doch da on creek the river is hemmed in between the rocky walls of kloochman canon the uppermost of the two narrow gorges through which the stikine passes in the lower part of its course the mountains from this point on become much higher and more precipitous from doch da on creek looking northward and eastward the valley is broad in extent and the mountains are relatively low and rounded many of the summits are bare of snow during the summer months to the southward and westward a jumbled mass of jagged peaks and ridges arises forbidding in the extreme and pressing closely in upon either side of the river where the stikine passes through the mountains the river valley is exceedingly rough and covered with a forest that is virtually impenetrable in this connection it is of interest to quote some statements of emmons 1911 pp 9 10 in his description of the country of the tahltan indians who occupy the region of the upper stikine the lower valley of the stikine from just below glenora to the coast a direct distance of about eighty miles is included within the coastal range and constitutes a region of great humidity with leaden skies and an annual precipitationif 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 143 equalling if not exceeding that of the coast which reaches a mean of eighty six inches the snowfall thereabouts is excessive and accounts for the extensive glaciers that fill the valleys and long after spring has opened in the colder interior the lower river flats are eovered with their burden of snow and ice forests of spruce fir cedar and hemlock cover the mountain slopes to the limit of tree growth while in the river valleys cottonwoods grow to considerable size and groves of alder and willow with the devil s club and berry bushes form an almost impenetrable barrier it may be pertinent to remark here that this region which may be characterized as the wet belt has never been inhabited by either tahltan or tlingit in the sense that they have permanently occupied it and it is scarcely more popular as a hunting ground owing to its poverty and inaccessibility at the mouth of the river and in the channel beyond there are numerous small rocky islands surrounding these centers there are miles of meadow marsh land and mud flats resulting from the deposition of silt by the river during the period of high water in midsummer the stream is gray and opaque with silt carried in suspension and this silt has been dropped in the channels immediately beyond the river s mouth until they are well nigh filled a conspicuous forest tree of the lower stikine is the cottonwood this tree covers all the low ground near the water grows densely and to a large size it finds a foothold on sand bars and aids in the building up of such areas into more stable bottom land consequently there are hundreds of acres of cottonwood in almost pure stands but slightly above the level of the river or even submerged at the highest water east of the coast range cottonwood is much less conspicuous than along the lower river though still persisting in considerable numbers in the country in general at the mouth of the stikine the sitka spruce is the dominant tree this tree with other associated conifers extends some distance up stream forming an evergreen forest that covers all but the unstable bottom land where the quick growing cottonwoods occur where rocky slopes rise abruptly from the river s bank the conifers range down to the water s edge the higher ground back from the first bottom is covered densely with woods of spruce and hemlock and with undergrowth of devil s club alder and huckleberry such woods extend with but slight breaks to a point a little above the little canon farther inland the spruce woods ascend higher and higher on the mountain sides until at doch da on creek the lower limit of this belt lies at an altitude of about 2000 feet somewhere below doch da on creek the sitka spruce of the coast gives way to other conifers of the interior but just where this happens we did not ascertain on the upper stikine poplar becomes the dominant growth of the valley mixed here and there with groves of conifers or of cottonwood j144 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 the sitkan district of southeastern alaska is characterized by excessive humidity and by relatively equable temperature the annual rainfall at many points is 100 inches or more the number of rainy days per year around 200 there is a great deal of foggy and cloudy weather the winters are not extremely cold nor are the summers very warm the vegetation of this region is comprised mostly of an extremely dense growth of coniferous forest trees and beneath the trees underbrush almost tropical in its luxuriance the sitkan district is here considered as including the islands between cross sound and dixon entrance together with a narrow strip of the adjacent mainland coast its eastward limits are sharply defined by the towering and precipitous range of mountains that rising abruptly from the shore parallels the coast to the eastward of this coast range in the interior of british columbia and alaska is a region of widely different character i have not exact meteorologic data for this section but certain general facts are obvious dawson 1889 pp 58 59o remarks on this subject as follows it may be stated here as showing the broad general contrast that while the annual precipitation at wrangell at the mouth of the stikine is over sixty inches that in the vicinity of telegraph creek on the inland side of the mountains is so small that it is necessary to irrigate cultivated land nor does this comparison of rain fall suflieiently mark the great diversity which actually obtains between the two climates the prevalence of clouded skies in the coast region being accompanied by a saturated state of the atmosphere while precisely opposite conditions are found on the eastern side of the mountain belt at not more than eighty miles inland from the general line of the coast the country east of the mountains is subject to far greater extremes of temperature than the coast region with hot summers and with extremely cold winters the forest covering includes a considerable proportion of conifers but there is also a still larger proportion of deciduous timber the animal life in these two regions the sitkan district of the coast and the adjacent interior is widely different the vailey of the stikine forms a highway between the two faunal areas otherwise separated by physical barriers and sharply contrasted in nearly all particulars though lying in close juxtaposition the presence of this channel of communication affords excellent opportunity for observation of the geographic behavior of the many animal species that by this means are permitted an outlet in either direction certain contrasted species and subspecies occupying comparable positions in each of the two faunal areas are brought together and thus into competition others with no such direct rival in the adjacent area are brought into contact with climatic conditions adverse in that they are unaccustomed 19 5 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 145 the stikine is one of several large rivers of the northwest that break through the coast range at right angles to the lines of those mountains their valleys thus lying transverse to the main lines of the range in a published report upon the geology of alaska a h brooks 1906 makes the following statement regarding the copper alsek taku and stikine rivers these together with the other large rivers of british columbia seem to traverse the coastal mountain barrier along valleys determined by antecedent conditions their lower valleys at least have the same direction as before the present coastal mountains were elevated and the streams maintained their courses across the barrier during the slow uplift p 286 again the valleys of the stikine and taku rivers which lie transverse to the coast range have probably inherited their courses from a former mature drainage system which was developed on the old peneplain loc cit p 287 in this connection it is worth while to note the appearance of the river valley of the upper stikine in the telegraph creek region there and for many miles down stream from that point the stream is bordered by series of terraces rising step by step to the base of the mountains beyond viewed from some overlooking height the course of any one of these terraces may be traced for a long distance it seems obvious that they represent the level of the river valley at different periods of its history see fig b the evidence of the geologist goes to show that diverse as the coast region and the interior are as regards fauna and flora the two have not been absolutely separated by the coast range at all times in the past any more than they are at present a channel of communication through the mountains has been there continuously from very remote geologic times save for a period when it must have been blocked by ice presumably all animal life was swept from both regions when the whole country was glacier covered presumably too conditions in the areas on either side of the coast range permitted the return of animals and plants from the southward when the mountains between were still mostly ice even now the range is glacier covered over a large portion of its area the higher peaks and ridges protrude steep and serrated far above the ice from the jagged unworn appearance of these higher crests they apparently never were covered the sheet of ice as seen today lies below the summit of the range and can be traced as a series of hanging glaciers appearing and re appearing for many miles at about the same level visible from the river below in certain canons and valleys tongues of this glacial covering extend downward i146 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 1 i shb far below the general level some of them to within a mile or two of the river it cannot be such a very long period of time since ice blocked the entire valley in fact there are today legends among the tahltan indians of a time when an ice bridge still extended across the stikine at the great glacier connecting ice masses that are now perhaps four or five miles apart of course as remarked by dawson 1889 p 53fe about this same tale it is impossible to determine whether this is a remembered fact or a fancied inference in this connection see also emmons 1911 p 15 the hypothesis of a glacial blockade of communication between the interior and the coast would imply the separate derivation of the animal life of each that is that there was invasion from the southward on either side of the coast range of the same or of different species as the case might be doubtless at a still later period there was invasion of certain species from the northward as well among birds in particular detailed comparisons may be made see fig p and upon comparing the avifauna of the interior and of the coast in the stikine region it will be seen that not only are comparable ecologic niches on either side of the mountains usually filled by different species rather than subspecies but that frequently the species are not especially closely related furthermore among the few cases where two subspecies of a species do occur abundantly on either side of the mountains there is hardly an instance where we were able to trace inter gradation along the connecting valley of the stikine in some few cases where the birds were abundant enough for us to ascertain the faet it was evident that certain subspecies at this particular point met as distinct species all this argues for invasion from the southward on either side of the coast range of bird species and subspecies that met at a much later period along such channels as the stikine valley the intrusion of a range of high mountains was productive of diverse climatic conditions in the two regions this in turn resulted in differences in the reestablished plant and animal life to a far greater extent than would follow from the mere presence of a physical barrier such as a mountain mass differences of temperature and of humidity arose so that at the present time the two areas east and west of the coast range respectively form strongly contrasted faunal areas dependent upon relative humidity and they are somewhat different zonally dependent upon temperatures at a considerably later period than that at which the regions on either side of the mountains became habitable conditions in certain19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 147 of the river valleys traversing the barrier as the stikine became such as to permit the existence of animal and plant life and various species extended their ranges up or down such channels of communication as circumstances permitted one factor that may be of present importance in limiting the use of the stikine valley as such a channel so far as birds are concerned is the late advent of summer conditions on the lower stikine compared with the regions on either side a seasonal tardiness that unquestionably prevents the nesting of many species in this intermediate strip at the time of their arrival from the south in this connection see dawson 1889 p 596 emmons 1911 pp 9 10 the general hypothesis outlined seems to accord with conditions as we now see them among birds it may be pointed out that it is consistent with the manner of occurrence of forms like hylocichla ustulata ustulata and h u swainsoni closely related subspecies of one species but behaving at this point like two distinct species it is consistent with the extension inland a certain distance of forms like sphyrapicus varius ruber and passerella iliaca fuliginosa and toward the coast of piranga ludoviciana see swarth 1911 p 95 and empi donax trailli alnorum and it is consistent with the restriction on one side or the other of such distinct and sharply delimited forms as bombycilla garrula pallidiceps and cyanocitta stelleri stelleri in this connection certain facts regarding the present day migration of birds in the region should be considered if there were any general travel between the interior and the coast such river valleys as the stikine would be the highways most generally followed our work in the region shows pretty clearly that such is not the case it seems evident that the birds of the interior travel north and south almost entirely east of the coast ranges some of them it is well known even pass east of the rocky mountains as they get farther south birds of the coastal region remain west of the mountains we found many characteristic inland species of birds some breeding others perhaps merely migrants as far down stream as great glacier some thirty miles from the coast the species seen there include penthestes atricapillus septentrionams setophaga ruticilla hylocichla ustulata swainsoni and vireosylva gilva swainsoni none of which has been taken on the coast dendroica aestiva was an abundant migrant though almost entirely absent at the mouth of the river the stikine in its passage through the coast range travels almost due south and it is natural that birds from the headwaters should migrate in numbers along this valley it is not so clear why148 university of california publications in zoology vo l 24 111 1 m they should not arrive at the mouth however a short distance below the great glacier about at the boundary the stream turns sharply to the westward just above this bend is the mouth of the iskut a tributary of the stikine that is nearly as large as the main stream at the point of junction the broad valley of the iskut enters from the southeast and its course is east and west for some distance a perfectly feasible outlet is thus afforded for migrating birds from the northward at just the point where the stikine valley would lead them astray i do not know that this is the course that is actually followed but it may very well be and if so it serves to explain the absence at the mouth of the river of species that were migrating southward in numbers at a point some thirty miles up stream there are however certain inland species that appear to migrate regularly coastward though doubtless in lesser numbers than go directly south dendroica coronata hooveri has been taken in the fall near the mouth of the taku river swarth 1911 p 99 and we obtained it at the mouth of the stikine each time in sufficient numbers to appear to be of regular occurrence sialia currucoides has been found near the mouth of the taku under similar circumstances swarth loc cit p 112 and while we ourselves did not meet with this species at the mouth of the stikine specimens have been taken there the question arises as to the migration of such species as melospiza melodia rufina and passerella iliaca fuliginosa coastal forms primarily but breeding far inland up the stikine whether or not they ascend and descend the river in their travels is not clear and the facts will be difficult to ascertain the casual occurrence at the mouth of the stikine in the spring of such species as myadestes townsendi and sialia currucoides see pp 301 309 is noteworthy such wanderers in the fall might be explained as individuals that had mistakenly followed the river to its mouth in the spring they can not be regarded as having gone astray the fact that they had reached this point is evidence that they were confidently traveling to a definite goal though along a path not usually followed by their kind at high water quantities of drift are carried down the river it is probable that small mammals living in the bottom lands often take refuge in fallen trees or in masses of brush that are suddenly floated away and are thus transported far down the river this may be one factor tending toward the more general extension coastward of inland species as compared with the sharper restriction of coastal forms see q 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 14 thus there are certain species of birds and mammals for which the valley of the stikine river acts as a channel of communication between interior and coast there are none to which it acts in the opposite role as a barrier to farther distribution north or south it would not to birds of course in any event as regards mammals conditions here are very different from what for example they are in the valley of a stream like the colorado river of the southwestern united states in that region not only the river itself but also the wide strips of adjacent bottom lands absolutely prevent the passage of certain desert mammals so that there are a number of species and subspecies restricted to one side or the other ef grinnell 1914 in the stikine valley no local conditions associations exist that tend to keep certain groups of animals either close to or far distant from the river banks and the same forms range unhindered from the water s edge well up the mountain sides for a period of months the river is frozen over quite to its mouth and there is no doubt that at that season individuals of many species of mammals cross from one side to the other 1 zonal and faunal position of the stikine valley the sitkan district of southeastern alaska has been generally considered to be mostly of the canadian life zone the areas that extend above timber on the higher mountains afford a strip of alpine arctic of considerable extent and a drawback to the recognition of the lower altitudes as canadian is the absence of any well defined intervening strip of hudsonian some birds and mammals that occur elsewhere in the canadian zone do occur in the lowlands of the sitkan district but on the other hand species generally regarded as indicative of the hudsonian zone are found throughout the whole region altogether it seems as though all the sitkan district below alpine arctic should be considered as of the hudsonian zone with a strong infusion of canadian in the southern part at least certainly this coastal strip is of a higher life zone than the adjacent interior in the country immediately east of the coast range there has not been sufficient work to permit detailed mapping of the life zones the most recent zonal map covering that section is the one published in the a 0 u check list 1910 pi 1 and is on too small a scale to permit of much detail on that map the hudsonian zone covers practically all of northern british columbia extending considerably farther southward there than in southern alaska to the westward or i mi 150 university of california publications in zoology vol 2 111 i i in northern alberta to the eastward the adjacent coastal strip of southeastern alaska is indicated as canadian and there are narrow strips of canadian extending inland along certain river valleys of which the stikine is one the interior is thus regarded as of a higher zone than the coast this is not in accordance with our own findings one of the rules upon which life zones are based is as follows the northward distribution of terrestrial animals and plants is governed by the sum of the positive temperatures for the entire season of growth and reproduction merriam 1898 p 54 exact figures are lacking for the region we visited but there can be no doubt that the summer temperature of the country immediately east of the mountains is appreciably higher than on the coast in further illustration of the relative zonal positions of the two regions the following lists of some characteristic summer birds of the lowlands should be considered coast dendragapus obscurus sitkensis oyanoeitta stelleri stelleri nannus hiemalis pacifieus regulus satrapa olivaeeus regulus calendula grinnelli ixoreus naevius naevius interior bonasa umbellus umbelloides buteo swainsoni nuttallornis borealis spizella passerina passerina vireosylva gilva swainsoni setophaga rutieilla furthermore in the course of our work the interesting fact was developed that certain species of birds that occur commonly at sea level on the coast occur inland at constantly increasing elevations ascending the stikine it is noticeable at a point about a hundred miles inland that the characteristic spruce forest found at sea level on the coast and on the banks along the lower reaches of the river here begins to ascend the mountain sides its place in the valley being taken by the poplar woods in the telegraph creek region we found the spruce belt at an altitude of perhaps 1500 to 2000 feet and found therein the bird species to which reference is made it is an additional complication that whereas certain subspecies extend unchanged from the coast to the interior as inhabitants of this spruce belt some species are represented by different subspecies at the two extremes nannus hiemalis pacifieus and regulus satrapa olivaeeus belong in the first mentioned category in the second dendragapus obscurus sitkensis regulus calendula grinnelli and ixoreus naevius naevius of the coast appear to be replaced in the interior by dendragapus obscurus flemingi regulus calendula calendula and ixoreus naevius meruloides among mammals marmota caligata is one conspicuous species that occurs at sea level on the coast m c caugata and at high elevations inland m c oxytona it is a matter for regret that we were unable to give1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 151 more study than we did to the fauna of the spruce belt of the interior mountains for our data are admittedly scanty but at any rate it is evident that the bird population at least of that region contains a large proportion of forms that are characteristic of lower levels at the coast the presence of the several animal and plant species noted serves for the recognition of a strip of hudsonian zone on the mountain fig n fig o fig n ascending the mountains the poplar woods are gradually left behind while spruce and fir appearing first as scattered thickets on north facing slopes or in cool canon beds gradually become the dominant forest growths this the hudsonian zone is

creek july 23 1919 sides as distinguished from the canadian zone of the valley below there are certain birds apparently all of high altitudes inland of which we learned regrettably little regarding their relationship to the coast fauna they are as follows canachites canadensis osgoodi is believed to be mainly a bird of the spruce belt on the mountains 152 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 in mm if ww perisoreus canadensis canadensis was quite through nesting when we reached the region but presumably does not breed in the valley near the river pinicola e fiammula appeared to belong to the spruce belt but this is doubtful zonotrichia coronata is in this latitude unquestionably a high mountain species reaching its greatest abundance in the scrubby balsam at timber line the unsettled question concerns its extension coastward in the coast region it does not occur in the lowlands but may occur on the mountains spizella monticola ochracea is a high mountain bird in the telegraph creek region probably near the southern limit of the bird s distribution we ourselves did not get far back from the stikine valley at any point and it might be argued that our finding there of certain species not extending into the hudsonian is no more than corroborative of the narrow line of canadian extending along the stikine valley shown in the zone map cited however recent work has been done in the interior at hazelton and at atlin which shows the general distribution of the bird species to which reference is made on this basis it seems altogether likely that northern british columbia should be regarded as predominantly of the canadian life zone rather than of the hudsonian it seems worth while to make such comparisons as are possible of the results attained by the other ornithological work recently done in northern british columbia taverner 1919 has reported upon a collection of birds from hazelton and e m anderson 1915a upon a collection from atlin the three points atlin telegraph creek and hazelton are about the same distance inland atlin is about 150 miles north of telegraph creek near the head of the taku drainage hazelton about 225 to the southward on the

more stress is necessarily given to evidence derived from them a large percentage of the mammals of the interior are of species of which it is difficult to obtain specimens especially in summer a number of species we failed to meet with at all though possibly they i i i154 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 occur in fair abundance and of others but an unsatisfactory representation was obtained as faunal areas the sitkan district and the country east of the mountains are strongly contrasted differences of humidity are as striking as those of temperature and these differences are reflected in the mammal bird and plant life of the two regions the peculiarities of the sitkan district are well known and the accepted boundaries well defined of the country east of the mountains as typified in the telegraph creek region the peculiarities are equally well marked this district of undetermined extent save where it impinges upon the sitkan district appears worthy of a name as a recognizable faunal area for the sake of convenient reference at least and i would suggest the adoption of cassiar district a name applied to it as a political division the birds of the two regions are more widely different than are the mammals that is there are more distinct types in each region the two mammal faunas are distinct enough and there are certain conspicuous species in each district that are not found in the other but in many cases closely related species or subspecies replace one another on either side of the dividing line certain species of which a large representation was obtained peromyscus and microtus exhibit inter gradation between related forms along the river to an extent far beyond anything found among the birds the two accompanying tables figs p q serve to show the relationships of the bird and mammal faunas of the two regions and the nature of the occurrence of the various species in the stikine valley as observed by us certain generalizations may be drawn from these tables 1 there are as previously remarked more distinct types of birds in the two contrasted regions than there are of mammals 2 there are more bird forms in the interior than on the coast in addition it may be said that bird life as regards number of individuals is far more abundant in the interior than on the coast 3 in the stikine valley at least there are a number of species of the interior that extend far toward the coast while very few coastal races extend any distance inland the fauna of the sitkan district is closely confined to the region west of the coast range in certain respects these tables are imperfect it would take many seasons of field work to fill in gaps in our knowledge that are here apparent also in the case of some species there are differences of altitude concerned implying zonal differences as well as those of linear distance and such distinctions could not be made in this table miles from coast 0 40 70 110 145 160

merriam but our one specimen does not exhibit the characters ascribed to that race cf merriam 1900 p 18 as compared with californian examples of navigator the telegraph creek specimen is exactly similar in general size and in skull characters but is of slightly more grayish coloration i have seen one specimen of neosorex from the coast of southeastern alaska in the collection of e p walker taken at rudyard bay about one hundred miles south of the stikine river and this animal does exhibit the cranial peculiarities ascribed to alaskanus it seems likely that the latter is confined to the

grizzlies are still numerous in the stikine region we ourselves saw fresh sign at many points though no animal was encountered the most obvious indication of their presence was of course footprints but other evidence was frequently found such as rotten logs ripped to pieces by the bears for the insect food they contained at doch da on creek an unoccupied cabin in the woods was entered by a bear several times during the two weeks we spent at that place and more or less damage done at this point we saw grizzly tracks in the snow at timber line about 4000 feet altitude at hyland s store telegraph creek we examined ten grizzly skins killed the previous fall all from about the same place on the klappan river a tributary of the stikine about 100 miles east of telegraph creek of these we purchased a skin with the skull of an old male no 31015 and a skin alone of a smaller animal apparently a female no 31016 these specimens both skins and skull answer fairly well to the description of ursus stikeenensis given by merriam 1914 p 178 1918 p 88 there are no less than seven species of big bears accredited to this general region by merriam 1918 whether or not i have ascribed our specimens to the correct form i think there is no doubt that all the skins in the above mentioned series belonged to one species for there was really remarkable uniformity in color and markings in the lot subsequently the skin of another bear was examined a huge male killed on clearwater creek and it again was of exactly the same type the noticeable color features are the general dark coloration the yel1 lowish or grayish grizzling on the shoulders and along the back and the black feet legs and lower parts the tanned skin of the male specimen an animal that from the appearance of the skull was evidently past maturity measures from tip of nose to base of tail approximately 1680 millimeters the one from clearwater creek above mentioned was very much larger the claws are short for a grizzly the longest claw on the male obtained measuring with dividers 55 millimeters they appear to be much worn iiuniversity of california publications in zoology it0l 24 ursus amerieanus amerieanus pallas black bear black bears occur in some abundance throughout the whole of the region we traversed they are frequently seen from the river boat in its travels up and down the stikine on june 5 one was seen not far from our camp at the junction rooting about under some rotten logs near the trail fresh tracks or other sign of the recent presence of black bears were seen practically everywhere we went except on sergief island five black bear skulls were purchased from mr a m vickery of telegraph creek the animals having been killed by him while he was patrolling the telegraph line to the southward of that place one of these no 31017 is an old male killed 122 miles south of telegraph creek on may 25 1919 the others are an old female and three small cubs nos 31018 31021 killed on june 17 1919 31 miles south of telegraph creek the two adult skulls from the telegraph creek region present certain evident points of difference from those of the black bear u a pugnax from the islands of southeastern alaska in the former the frontal region is relatively high and rounded in the latter it is noticeably low and flat in pugnax the whole skull is more angular in appearance in pugnax too the teeth are large as compared with those of bears from the interior especially the last upper molar this last character is one that persists in black bears from all the islands off the coast of southern alaska and british columbia it is conspicuous in pugnax of the southern islands of the alexander archipelago which has a large squarely built low browed skull it is one of the characters of carlottae from the queen charlotte islands cf osgood 1901 p 30 which has an elongate skull it appears again in the black bear of vancouver island which judging from the several specimens at hand is a smaller animal than carlottae or pugnax with a rather high rounded skull and with the teeth of large size especially the last upper molar there is very little material at hand from the mainland coast of southeastern alaska one rather young male from bradfield canal a short distance south of the stikine river has the enlarged last upper molar of pugnax and is apparently to be referred to that form thus it may be that pugnax occupies a narrow strip of coast on the mainland of southeastern alaska as well as the islands and that the type of black bear found in the telegraph creek region is confined to the territory east of the coastal range of mountains l922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 161 of the available material the telegraph creek skulls are most nearly of the type of those from the kenai peninsula and takutat bay alaska it may be that the name given to the black bear of the kenai region by allen 1910 p 115 ursus amerieanus perniger should also be applied to the bears of the stikine section but at present it seems best to use the name amerieanus for the stikine specimens a revision of the group is necessary to determine among other things the applicability of the name ursus americamis pallas and the characters pertaining to the form to which that name should be subspecifi cally restricted in the present connection the main interest lies in the apparent occurrence of two different forms of the black bear in the stikine region amerieanus at the headwaters of the river and pugnax in the coastal region near its mouth oanis occidentalis richardson timber wolf wolves from all accounts occur in some numbers throughout the interior of northern british columbia along the length of the stikine valley and along the adjoining alaskan coast and on the nearby islands we saw none nor any fresh sign until we reached sergief island there fresh wolf tracks were seen in the sand of the river bank and on several occasions when shooting out on the marsh the reports of our guns started wolves howling in the forest nearby on august 20 two of the animals were seen and investigation showed that the place was the home of a wolf family as it probably had been since the young were born two or three months earlier the two we saw were pups not yet full grown and they were probably awaiting the parent s return from a foraging expedition certain areas in the grass had been trampled flat for beds and a large flat rock nearby furnished an ideal lounging place this rock rose above the marsh grass and thus afforded an excellent observation station some cracks in the granite gave foothold to two scrubby spruce trees arching over the rocky platform and the rock below was covered with a deep layer of spruce needles affording a dry soft bed this shelter had been occupied so much that the wolf smell clinging to it was apparent even to the duller olfactories of a human being broad trails led away through the grass over the marshes in various directions and into the impenetrable fastnesses of the spruce woods on the adjoining hillside the trampled grass showed here and there bunches of feathers or a few crushed bones of ducks and geese water fowl were evidently a staple food m i162 university of california publications in zoology ivol 24 hi ii 8h1 5 ill mali wm there were apparently three pups and one adult in this family two of the young were taken and the old wolf then removed the survivor evidently to some distance no trace of the two was found anywhere about the island the parent had been seen several times before the two young were caught mr w e parrott living upon sergief island gave us the skin of an adult male wolf that he had shot on july 20 he was sitting at breakfast when his cat rushed into the house for protection from the wolf which had chased the cat through the garden looking through the window he saw the wolf leisurely retreating toward the beach and shot the animal it was no new experience for the cat whenever his owner went to town a ladder was left leaning against the house as a refuge in case of such pursuit and apparently there was not infrequent occasion to use it the wolf thus obtained may have been the male parent of the family we encountered in color this adult and the two pups are very much alike the adult is rather dark though not so black as some from this region there is a good deal of black on the upperparts from the eyes to the tip of the tail produced by black tippings to long hairs that are yellowish or reddish basally the muzzle is reddish the legs decidedly reddish and the underparts a somewhat paler brown it is not a gray appearing animal at all the two pups are somewhat duller colored with the black not so intense and the reddish areas paler in life however the young wolves looked quite dark there is at hand an adult male wolf from prince of wales island alaska southwestward from sergief island that is almost entirely black another specimen from the interior the yukon region is also black so that evidently dark color alone can not be considered as distinguishing the wolves of either of these two regions two skulls of fully adult wolves from iskut summit sixty miles southeast of telegraph creek do not present any obvious points of difference from the above mentioned adult from prince of wales island the latter has been recorded by the present write r swarth 1911 p 136 as canis pambasileus elliot in the belief that that name was applicable to a coastal subspecies the prince of wales specimen presents characters of size and color such as are ascribed to pambasileus elliot 1905 p 79 whether or not the name pambasileus may properly be used for a local race from the type locality the mt mekinley region it does not seem that any distinction can be made as between the wolf ifj19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 163 of the coast of southeastern alaska and the wolf of the adjoining interior in the light of our limited material and with the lack of a systematic revision of this group of mammals it is safer to consider them as all one form to which the name canis occidentalis richardson seems applicable the material obtained by us in the stikine region consists of the following specimens skulls and limb bones of two adults nos 31042 31043 taken at iskut summit sixty miles southeast of telegraph creek the gift of an acquaintance at telegraph creek an adult male apparently not quite full grown skin only no 31009 shot at sergief island july 20 1919 and two young females about half grown skins and skulls nos 31010 31011 taken at sergief island on august 24 and august 25 1919 mustela cicognani richardsoni bonaparte richardson weasel weasels undoubtedly occur throughout the region traversed though we ourselves did not see one during the summer at a trapper s cabin a few miles from telegraph creek a pile of desiccated weasel carcasses his catch of the previous winter yielded a series of nineteen skulls nos 31023 31041 with complete skeletons in most eases these skulls in comparison with a series from the coast of southeastern alaska exhibit the differences stated by merriam 1896 pp 11 13 to distinguish the two subspecies mustela c richardsoni of the interior and m c alascensis of the coast the telegraph creek skulls as is claimed for richardsoni are perceptibly narrower between the orbits and across the muzzle and there is a slight difference in the shape of the zygomatic arches in the two lots allen 1903 p 563 has described putorius microtis from shesley british columbia near the headwaters of the stikine but our series of skulls from telegraph creek are evidently all of one species mustela c richardsoni mustela vison energumenos bangs british columbia mink one trapped at doch da on creek on july 19 no 31002 and a skeleton preserved that was picked up near telegraph creek no 31022 the species occurs probably in fair abundance throughout the whole stikine region the one skin obtained is notably dark colored as compared with specimens of mustela v nesolestes from certain islands of the alexander archipelago and we were told that the mink 1164 university of california publications in zoology it0l 24 i is i hj hi from the stikine were all dark the skull pertaining to this specimen has the small sized last upper molar that is supposed to distinguish energumenos from nesolestes but in the skull from telegraph creek this tooth is as large as in most examples of the latter subspecies there is at hand a mink from near the mouth of the taku river and one from wrangell both qf which are of the same dark color as our stikine river specimen thus the specimens available suggest the existence of a dark colored mainland form extending toward the coast at least along the larger rivers and reaching some of the islands lying nearest the mainland and a lighter colored subspecies existing upon most of the islands of the alexander archipelago there is not sufficient material available however to verify this surmise at any rate the mink of the upper stikine valley is a relatively small form and not the large ingens of the nearby yukon drainage at present it seems proper to use for this race the name mustela vison energumenos bangs originally applied to the mink of southern british columbia our one specimen is very similar in appearance to an example of energumenos from the vicinity of seattle i phoca richardi richardi gray harbor seal seals were observed as far up the stikine river as doch da on creek at times in considerable numbers on may 21 as we began our trip up the river they were seen in veritable herds over the first thirty miles at one place there were at least a hundred in sight at once farther up stream they became less and less abundant no specimens were obtained and the identification here accorded the animals seen is purely inferential peromyscus maniculatus borealis mearns northern white footed mouse peromyscus

31050 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 165 a series of white footed mice collected at and near telegraph creek in 1902 has been reported upon by allen 1903 p 540 under the name peromyscus arcticus mearns peromyscus maniculatus borealis mearns 1911 p 102 what is undoubtedly the same series of specimens is listed by osgood 1909a p 49 under peromyscus maniculatus arcticus mearns therefore though this museum possesses no examples of peromyscus maniculatus borealis other than our series from the telegraph creek region i feel justified on the grounds above mentioned in assuming this series to be representative of the subspecies borealis the chief interest attaching to the telegraph creek form in the present connection lies in its relationship to the subspecies peromyscus m macrorhim ws from the region adjacent to the mouth of the stikine river of macrorhi mis this museum possesses an abundant representation from various points in southeastern alaska before proceeding with a discussion of the specimens we collected certain features of the problem should be stated in the interest of a clear understanding of conditions osgood 1909a in his comments upon arcticus borealis and macrorhinus makes no direct comparison between the two at that time there were no specimens extant to show that these forms came together at any point from his key and descriptions however certain contrasting characters of these subspecies may be summarized as follows peromyscus m macrorhinus general size larger hind foot 24 to 25 mm tail longer than head and body

coloration paler on the alaskan coast just north of the habitat of macrorhinus is the subspecies hylaeus between hylaeus and borealis in the region north of telegraph creek is the subspecies algidus the interior representative of the dark coast form hylaeus osgood 1909a p 56 according to osgood loc cit algidus and borealis occur together in places within the general range of the former and maintain their distinctness algidus compared with borealis is a long tailed form it differs from the latter in this respect just as macrorhinus does allen 1903 p 544 records as peromyscus oreas a single mouse taken in the cheonnee mountains near telegraph creek where borealis also was secured this same specimen presumably is recorded by osgood loc cit as algidus the cheonnee mountains are a short distance 111 iii rf h pill j i jl 1 166 university of california publications in zoology it0l 24 southeast of telegraph creek if algidus occurs in that range it should be at telegraph creek also we obtained several long tailed specimens of peromyscus at and near telegraph creek and supposed that they were examples of algidus study of the series as a whole however inclines me to another explanation of the variation that seems more satisfactory namely that there is continuous distribution of peromyscus along the stikine valley from the habitat of borealis in the interior to that of macrorhinus on the coast that there is intergradation between these two subspecies in the stikine valley that telegraph creek is about the easternmost point to which intergrades with macrorhinus extend and that the variants obtained by us at that point are all the results of intergradation the long tailed individuals from the telegraph creek region aside from this peculiarity are not notably different in color or otherwise from the general run of specimens obtained there at any rate they could not be grouped together as presenting an aggregation of characters justifying their separation as a distinct subspecies neither were they obtained under circumstances that would tend to establish the belief that two different races were concerned the peromyscus taken at the junction are lighter colored than macrorhinus of the coast and they are smaller and shorter tailed this station is some five miles north of the stikine river presumably these mice are more nearly typical of borealis than any others we obtained in this series there is one aberrant individual with an exceedingly long tail otherwise there is great uniformity in the lot at the town of telegraph creek we obtained more long tailed mice and noted a slight increase in general size as compared with the series from the junction descending the stikine river from telegraph creek the peromyscus collected at our various stations were progressively larger and darker colored as the coast was approached the accompanying diagrams figs r s t show variation in hind foot length of tail vertebrae and ratio of tail vertebrae to total length in the white footed mice taken at our various collecting stations in the stikine region as compared with macrorhinus of the alaskan coast color and general size vary in about the same way as the characters illustrated barring the series from the junction which are probably close to true borealis the stikine river peromyscus are typical of neither borealis nor macrorhinus they form a series of intergrades between the two it is not possible to draw a hard and fast line as a1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 167 boundary both on account of the gradual change in the entire peromyscus population of the intermediate territory and because of individual variation which brings typical examples of each far within the margin on either side of the debatable strip allowing for such variation however it seems proper though an arbitrary division to consider as borealis the mice from the upper stikine as far down as glenora macrorhinus extending up stream as far

back of the town the rats were not numerous and after one or two had been caught at a place the traps usually remained undisturbed the old houses of the abandoned town of glenora afforded shelter to the wood rats but apparently not more than one or two families occupied any one cabin from several of the cabins the rats had well worn trails leading into the surrounding thickets there they cut quantities of green vegetation some to be carried into the houses and eaten at once some apparently to be dried for later use most of the old cabins had the doors and windows boarded up and in the gloom of the interior the rats and mice were active all day the cabins and warehouses with their miscellaneous contents long abandoned formed a veritable wood rats paradise and they gave their imagination full swing in the lines of nest building and the accumulation of useless objects for which their tribe is famous in one place a storeroom full of snowshoes had been entered and of the contents there was little but the wooden frames left the leather thongs were hanging in shreds in an old barn round masses of baling wire had been filled out with horse manure and grass to form extraordinary globular nests the one specimen of neotoma from the vicinity of doch da on creek was taken on the mountain side at an elevation of about 2000 feet this was the farthest down stream that

hip glands all three were trapped in alder thickets in places frequented by evotomys there have been available for comparison three specimens of lemming mice in the e p walker collection from wrangell alaska the type locality of synaptomys wra ngeu ten from mainland points in southeastern alaska ranging from boca de quadra to port snet tisham and nine from the prince william sound region alaska i also received as a loan from the united states biological survey six typical specimens of synaptomys borealis dalli three from points near the base of the alaska peninsula two from the kuskokwim drainage and one from the yukon as far as i can see the specimens from the coast of southeastern alaska island and mainland are all alike they are all wrangeli furthermore the differences between wrangeli and dalli are slight and as these differences in the series here assembled are bridged by individual variation and to some extent by geographic variation i consider the two forms as subspecies of one species synaptomys borealis for the use of this name see preble 1908 pp 183 186 see also hollister 1912 p 19 the skull of dalli compared with wrangeli is somewhat larger and rather more angular and more heavily built otherwise i can see no differences in the two lots some of those from the prince william sound region incline toward dalli in their larger size as compared with more southern specimens indicating perhaps intergradation between wrangeu and dalli at what is probably the northern limit of the form wrangell externally four specimens of dalli are appreciably more reddish than any in the wrangeli series the two remaining dalli are of the same coloration as the mode of wrangeli thus instead of wrangeli being an insular species confined to wrangell island my conception of it is as being a rather wide ranging form and a coastal subspecies contrasted with dalli of the interior its range is the coast of southeastern alaska from prince william sound south at least to boca de quadra it has been taken upon two islands hinchinbrook island prince william sound and wrangell island both but slightly separated from the mainland 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 173 another species synaptomys andersoni has been described by allen 1903 p 554 based upon a single specimen from level mountain near the headwaters of the stikine river in all likelihood therefore mice of this genus occur throughout the entire length of the stikine valley at present however with the few specimens extant in collections it is not possible to form an opinion as to whether or not there are two species or subspecies in existence at the head of the river and toward its mouth respectively evotomys dawsoni dawsoni merriam dawson red backed mouse an adult female no 30720 was taken at the junction june 4 trapped during the day on a dry poplar covered hillside it is apparently a typical example of evotomys dawsoni dawsoni the next obtained no 30721 was caught at doch da on creek july 17 in a tangle of alders grass and nettles bordering a slough this specimen is a male not fully mature but evidently referable to dawsoni somewhere in the section of the river between doch da on creek and flood glacier lies the dividing line between dawsoni and wrangeli it would be of interest to find if the two occurred together at any point evotomys wrangeli bailey wrangell red backed mouse thirty specimens taken nos 30722 30751 three at flood glacier twenty three at great glacier and four at sergief island of this series there is one old male no 30735 great glacier with conspicuous gray patches over the hip glands and showing rooted molars with deeply worn surfaces there are eleven more that may be termed adult as being in the adult pelage though none of these has the gray flank patches more than faintly indicated the remainder are young at various stages of growth the red backed mice from these three stations are all e wrangeli indistinguishable from specimens at hand from wrangell island the range of that species is thus carried far inland up the stikine valley very close to the habitat of dawsoni if in fact the two do not meet the four specimens from the uppermost station flood glacier show no appreciable departure from the mode of wrangeli there is no indication here of intergradation toward the nearly adjacent dawsoni the two species however resemble each other so closely in form and in some pelages in color also that wrangeli would seem to be a coastal offshoot of dawsoni bearing somewhat the same relation to that j174 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 species as microtus admiraltiae of admiralty island does to m drum mondi of the adjacent mainland the two microtus however are less widely separated than the evotomys have become further it may be assumed that evotomys phaeus of the alaskan mainland south of the habitat of wrangeli is of a different line of descent it differs so

place in the immediate vicinity of sawmill lake some parts of the lake shore were grown with tall grass partly flooded and strewn with logs and other drift here the drummond meadow mice had their homes their runways traversed the moss grown logs and in the intervals between they evidently traveled through very deep water when necessary shlsl 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 175 allen 1903 p 550 comments upon the capture of but a single specimen of m drummondi at telegraph creek compared with an abundance of m mordax as indicative of the two species having different centers of abundance but from our own experience there seems to be demonstrated merely a preference for different sorts of surroundings microtus mordax about telegraph creek was mainly caught along stream sides the kind of habitat it is known to frequent in other parts of its range and none was taken in any of the semi aquatic runways where m drummondi was obtained at glenora the two species occurred in exactly the same places runways used commonly by both traversing the weed grown meadows about the old houses at doch da on creek also they were found together in the bottom lands we took no drummond meadow mice at either flood glacier or great glacier but the capture of a single specimen at sergief island may be taken as indicative of the occurrence of the species over the entire length of the river there are probably times when drummondi is abundant at sergief island but our visit there was during a period of scarcity half grown young were taken at telegraph creek the middle of june and a little later young not more than two thirds the bulk of adults were breeding embryos in gravid females ranged from four to ten in number microtus mordax mordax merriam cantankerous

showed signs of having been populated by meadow mice during the winter months but the animals had since moved into the nearby woods those we obtained were taken along the streams or in wet places among the trees they were apparently rather solitary in their habits and there were no well defined runways in use at glenora meadow mice were extremely abundant the open meadow land was not frequented to any extent but there were extensive clearings since grown up with fireweed that were intersected in every direction with j is i ii176 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 ill si m mi much traveled runways the shelter afforded by rail fences and the sides of the crumbling houses was also taken advantage of and traps placed in such situations yielded mice night after night a great many more were caught at that station than the thirty eight that were preserved at doch da on creek this meadow mouse was not especially abundant most that were caught were taken in weed grown bottom lands at flood glacier well defined runways with many little piles of freshly cut green stuff gave an appearance of an abundance of meadow mice but despite the plentiful sign specimens were taken but slowly apparently one full grown microtus can establish and operate an elaborate system of runways one weed grown area some fifty feet square intersected with well used paths in which were found fifteen or twenty little piles of freshly cut green weed stems yielded just one adult meadow mouse at great glacier but two specimens were trapped the occurrence of a meadow mouse of the longicaudus group over the entire length of the stikine river is of interest as bearing upon the relationship of microtus mordax of the interior and m macrurus of the coast the two forms are closely related and though heretofore recognized as distinct species the differences between them are comparable to what is found among subspecies of some one species in other sections of the genus the main differences between the two are of coloration and of length of tail there are skull differences also but not trenchant ones macrurus like other coastal species is of dark brownish coloration quite reddish brown dorsally mordax is distinctly gray macrurus has a longer tail than mordax longer in actual measurement and longer in relation to total length both macrurus and mordax in the northern parts of their respective ranges southeastern alaska and northern british columbia are somewhat smaller than they are at their southern limits we obtained long tailed meadow mice at various points on the stikine river down as far as great glacier and i have at hand several additional specimens from the collection of e p walker taken at clearwater creek just below the british columbia alaska boundary line there are also available specimens from wrangell and mitkof islands near the mouth of the stikine and from various points on the mainland short distances north and south of the mouth of the river macrurus is abundantly represented in the collection of this museum from various points in the alexander archipelago 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 111 macrurus as represented by specimens from the more western islands of the alexander archipelago is a very different looking animal from mordax of the interior the brown coloration of the one and the gray of the other correlated with the differences in size and length of tail render the two series absolutely unlike meadow mice from mitkof and wrangell islands however are in color about midway between the extremes indicated and the few specimens at hand from the lower stikine tend still further to bridge the gap as regards color it is possible to arrange specimens with regard to geographical position so as to produce a graded series of changes from one extreme to the other with no abrupt break at any point the same is true of general size and of skull characters the accompanying diagram fig v 1

perhaps in widely scattered colonies that are easily overlooked fresh sign was found about a beaver pond at flood glacier but evidently of but a few individuals we were told of the occurrence of muskrats at doch da on creek but we ourselves saw no evidence of their presence the specimens obtained present such marked peculiarities of appearance as may very well be indicative of an undescribed race from the coast of southeastern alaska but at present it does not seem advisable to affix a name to this isolated series in color they are dark dorsally and extremely gray elsewhere spatulata as represented in this museum by comparable specimens from various parts of its range to the northward of the stikine is decidedly reddish our sergief island specimens are closely similar to fall examples of osoyoosensis from the puget sound region some of the latter have an indication of cinnamon on the underparts and sides which is seen in none of the sergief island specimens but there are certain skins from the neighborhood of seattle that are exactly like them in color osoyoosensis however is a large species and the specimens in question are of small size agreeing with spatulata in this respect thus the sergief island muskrats are like osoyoosensis in color like spatulata in size the skull is of the spatulata type being relatively broad with wide spreading zygomata there are

that specimens be taken from various points along the coast between the known habitats of spatulata and osoyoosensis before the peculiarities of the series at hand from revillagigedo and sergief

extending its range to any extent it is an interesting fact that we did not obtain any at glenora house mice must have been there when the town was occupied by people apparently upon the withdrawal of

at hand from the mouth of the chickamin river alaska and the two are indistinguishable in appearance the peculiarities of the skull in the adult may be an indication of intergradation between caligata and oxytona in the middle reaches of the stikine but the material at hand does not suffice to settle that point citellus plesius plesius osgood bennett ground squirrel on june 4 two ground squirrels were taken at the summit nos 30994 30995 and one other was seen this same place was visited on may 29 and again on june 5 without any animals being encountered it was still quite wintry at that

camped nearby made a trip to the summit of glenora mountain which rises just north of the town they reported an abundance of ground squirrels on the slopes above the timber we kept a careful lookout for the species on the mountains above doch da on creek where the surroundings were apparently ideal but saw none of the animals nor any burrows or other certain sign of their presence eutamias borealis caniceps osgood gray headed chipmunk of general distribution in the region about telegraph creek and glenora not abundant but apt to be encountered anywhere in the lowlands at doch da on creek chipmunks were noticeably less abundant and the species was not seen at all farther down the river while apparently mostly at low altitudes chipmunks were sometimes found well up the mountain sides on july 11 one was seen at timber line about 3000 feet above doch da on creek dandelions were a favorite food toward the end of june and in july these were going to seed and chipmunks were constantly seen stripping the fluffy heads individuals had certain favorite spots for eating and at such places there were heaps of dandelion fuzz and parts of the blossoms twenty eight specimens were

stikine region 185 be encountered in the course of a day s walk at doch da on creek they were less numerous due perhaps to their having been incidentally killed by the systematic trapping that had been carried on during the previous winter over much of the ground we covered at that point at flood glacier and great glacier red squirrels were extremely scarce we realized of course the fact that this species occurred as two different geographic races at the mouth of the stikine and at the head of the river respectively and that there was probably continuous distribution of the species for the entire length of the stream we nil 1 pig x thicket of wild cherry prunus demissa at telegraph creek this shrub grows in abundance in that region by the middle of june the bushes are covered with white

realized also that in all probability somewhere near flood glacier or great glacier was the critical point where the two subspecies meet and for that reason we bent every effort toward getting specimens from those stations however not more than two or three were seen at each place at sergief1 island too red squirrels were scarce altogether we collected twenty specimens nos 30974 30993

summit twelve miles to the northward six specimens from telegraph creek were submitted to mr b a preble of the united states biological survey for subspecific determination his conclusion is that these squirrels are virtually identical with sciurus h hudsonicus in some respects notably in the color of the back they show some slight approach to s h petulans of the coast they agree however with hudsonicus as regards the color of the fringe of the tail the glenora and doch da on creek specimens are clearly in the same category as the telegraph creek specimens they are all s h hudsonicus the squirrels from flood glacier great glacier and sergief island are just as unequivocally s h picatus as between hudsonicus and picatus there are differences of color and of the skull red squirrels from doch da on creek three full grown young are in both respects typical of hudsonicus and they represent the farthest point down stream at which this subspecies was taken our next collecting station was flood glacier some forty miles down the river and as noted there was taken at that point but the one red squirrel typical of picatus both as regards color and skull whether there actually is a stretch of country in this intermediate region where red squirrels are as scarce as our experience seems to indicate or whether we were merely unlucky in the necessarily limited areas our field work covered at flood glacier and great glacier remains still to be determined it may be of course that there is actually a notable scarcity of the animals throughout this intermediate region that there is some attribute of the country that is unfavorable to the red squirrel and hence serves to keep apart these two subspecies for the use of the name sciurus hudsonicus picatus see swarth 1921 p 92 we gained but little information regarding the life history of the red squirrel in the region explored near the junction individuals were several times seen to enter holes in the ground holes that from their

abundance in the country about telegraph creek but we were there during a period of scarcity and they were all but totally absent as evidence of former abundance we found scattered through the woods many crumbling rabbit skeletons bleached and weathered which had lain there for a year at least perhaps longer on june 18 fresh rabbit tracks were seen in the dust of a trail some five or six miles west of telegraph creek and on july 7 a young rabbit about two thirds grown no 31003 was taken near the stikine river opposite glenora no others were seen nor any indication of their presence at any other point castor canadensis canadensis kuhl beaver an abundant species on the lower stikine where the many miles of flooded bottom lands the mazes of winding channels and sloughs and the abundant forest growth all combine to make conditions that are well nigh ideal for the beaver above the canon the species is scarce there are undoubtedly many obscure little ponds hidden in the woods and blind sloughs and channels running back from the river that still shelter small and scattered colonies but the beavers have been so nearly extirpated in this region that trapping is no longer profitable a few miles from telegraph creek there were beaver ponds some of considerable size but we were told that the beavers had long been wiped out at glenora one evening the resounding plop of a beaver s tail in the water near the river s edge gave evidence of one survivor at least near doch da on creek several miles back from the river there was a series of ponds all occupied by beavers though so many had been caught there during the several years immediately preceding our visit that there were probably but few still left at flood glacier and at great glacier beavers were seen and also abundant evidence of recent activities at farm island just above sergief island at the mouth of the river dixon found a colony of some size and on september 5 he trapped two at that point these two specimens nos 31013 31014 immatures probably born the preceding year were the only ones taken this material is too scanty to definitely determine the subspecific position of the beaver of the stikine region but it may be said that the two animals obtained are appreciably paler in coloration than phaeus of admiralty island or even than leucodonta of vancouver island 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 189 we saw trappers skins also from various points on the stikine and they all appeared to be paler colored than phaeus it seems safe to assume that but one subspecies of beaver occurs over the entire length of this river and apparently it is a relatively pale colored form there are probably beavers on the mainland coast of southeastern alaska wherever conditions are suitable and also on most of the islands from this whole general region however specimens are available only from admiralty island where the dark colored castor c phaeus occurs whether this form occupies a habitat more extensive than this one island and the extent of the area on the coast of alaska that is occupied by the paler colored subspecies of the stikine region are points that still remain to be ascertained odocoileus columbianus sitkensis merriam sitka deer no deer nor any sign of their presence was seen until we reached the mouth of the river at sergief island the fresh tracks of one individual were seen on the beach during the first week in september deer are fairly numerous on the nearby farm island but they seldom cross over to sergief dixon spent several days august 26 29 on a

sr ill i alces amerieanus gigas miller alaska moose the most important game mammal of the region and the main source of fresh meat for the residents of the country we were told that twenty or thirty years ago moose were scarce in the telegraph creek region and almost unknown farther down the river and that they had steadily increased in numbers since that time at present they are abundant we saw fresh sign everywhere we went in the immediate vicinity of each of our camps including points within two miles of the town of telegraph creek and as far down the stikine as the great glacier moose are known to occur regularly even farther down stream and we were told of one being killed at the river s mouth some years ago on the mountains above doch da on creek fresh moose tracks and droppings were seen just above timber line at about 4000 feet elevation 190 university of california publications in zoology vou 24 will l i at the junction on may 27 dixon was going quietly through the poplar woods in search of birds when a cow moose suddenly burst forth from a clump of alders some thirty yards away and charged viciously upon him with mouth open and neck bristles all on end when she was within fifteen yards and still coming he fired a load of dust shot whereupon she swerved to one side and went off through the trees a search of the bushes from which she had emerged disclosed a newly born calf still unable to do more than totter about on its long and very wobbly legs dixon s observations upon this animal read in part as follows when first found on the very spot where it was born the calf was not frightened but came up to me whining like a puppy dog later this low whine was found to be a usual call note of the youngster the moose characters of large ears overhanging nose high shoulders low rump and long legs were all conspicuous the face and particularly the ears were much lighter colored than the body an incipient mane of black hairs showed as a narrow line from the back of the head to a point just back of the shoulders the metatarsal glands were conspicuously eolored by a patch of whitish hairs covering an area one inch long by one half inch wide the body was clothed with thick warm hair plumbeous at the basal half then brown and with a faint tipping of black in walking on level ground the young moose stood 30 inches high at the shoulder and 27 inches at the rump the distance from the nose to the tip of the tail in life was 30 inches the sense of hearing was most keen sight second and smell last a cracking twig always startled her violently the upper eyelid had eyelashes over an inch long which helped to keep the myriad mosquitoes out of the eyes a swarm of these bloodthirsty pests were sucking blood from the helpless youngster when first discovered in attempting to nibble grass the little moose knelt down on her front legs and in this position was able to bite off the tender grass with her eight sharp lower incisors well developed even in this 24 hour old calf attempts were also made to nibble budding willow twigs in lying down she knelt on her front legs first then the posterior was lowered and the long hind legs tucked up under or to one side of the body in getting up the animal rose to its knees on its front legs and then the hind quarters were raised by mid afternoon the young moose followed me about the camp so that i had difficulty in keeping far enough away to use the camera rangifer osborni allen cassiar caribou we ourselves were at no time in caribou territory and my only reason for including the species here is to place on record information received regarding the distribution of this animal telegraph creek is the outfitting place of hunters who visit the region each fall and many caribou are killed by them but the mountains where the hunting is usually done are reached by long pack trips to the northward and eastward fc 1922 swarth birds and mammals c the stikine region 191 w e were told by the caretaker at mr callbreath s farm across the river from glenora that a band of ten 01 twelve caribou had spent the previous winter on the unforested summit of glenora mountain where he had often watched them with a field glass this may represent the extreme western point reached by the species in this region twenty five miles farther down the river there are other mountains with extensive areas rising above timber line which have been hunted over for many years past by captain a b conover residing at the mouth of clearwater creek he told us that he had never seen any caribou there nor any sign of their presence pig v young alaska moose alces amerieanus gigas twenty four hours old the long legs of the adult moose is a feature that is much accentuated in the calf giving an appearance of extreme

montanus columbianus allen columbian mountain goat mountain goats are probably of general distribution on the higher mountains from telegraph creek west to the coast our own experiences were limited to three localities at glenora on july 3 an acquaintance ascended the mountain that rises behind the town and he told us that he saw two goats near the summit on july 11 and 23 we climbed the mountain

were decorated with streamers of long white hair caught from the shedding animals as they passed along recently occupied beds could be distinguished at many points and numerous footprints and droppings all attested to the presence of mountain goats in some numbers we saw none here however though on the 11th when we started to descend the mountain toward evening fresh tracks were seen at one point where a goat had crossed our trail since morning four days july 16 to 19 were devoted by dixon to a hunt on the mountain above kirk s creek some eight or ten miles north of doch da on creek he saw a number of the animals and shot an adult male no 31008 several were in sight at once when this one was killed and dixon s observations on the behavior of the remainder of the band include some interesting items his notes read in part as follows while we were skinning our specimen another goat came back and after grazing about awhile laid down against a granite boulder where with head propped up against a stone he watched us as we worked although we were in plain sight and only 150 yards away he lay there placidly observing us as soon as i started to sneak down out of sight in an attempt to approach near enough to get a photo the goat got up and went over the ridge and across a narrow ravine where he stood waiting watching me as i came over the crest of the ridge 100 yards away i followed him over the next ridge and saw him disappear down a snow slide toward a hanging valley below prom this latter point i searched the cliffs above me with the binoeulars and saw a goat lying in a niche in the cliff high above me this animal lay motionless with outstretched neck watching me intently going around the ridge out of sight at one side of the cliff i worked my way up to a level with him then edged around the cliff so that when i stepped out in sight i was less than thirty feet distant the goat bounded to his feet then slowly and deliberately jumped from niche to niche along the face of the cliff until a slide was reached here he bounded and slid down scattering the rocks as he went the spot where he had been resting about the center of the cliff was like the eyrie of a golden eagle and about as difficult of access it seemed incredible that so large an animal could ever have reached it along the face of the cliff a man certainly could not have done so his tracks led across a snow slide to a cavity at the south side of a large boulder the snow melting away from the roek left a hole about six feet long three feet wide and four feet deep and in here the goat had lain down resting on the snow and peering at me over the brink only the dark eyes and horns could be seen the otherwise white coloration blending perfectly with the snow i walked down to within 100 feet of the animal and took two photos while he lay perfectly still then i crawled to the edge of the snow bank too steep for me to cross and threw rocks at him arising at first he stood his ground stamping his fore feet or making feints at charging me i finally struck him with a stone and he jumped to the edge of the snow bank where he stood with arched neck and tail erect as though in challenge then he started down the19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 193 snowslide with hind legs flexed and spread well apart and front legs rigid almost on his haunches he slid and wriggled in safety down the dangerous slide which at the bottom dropped over a precipice at the top of this cliff he crossed to the solid rock beyond and then turned to see if i was coming the goat taken was a male fully mature but not of great age his weight was estimated at two hundred pounds this animal has almost none of the long shaggy covering with which we usually associate the species it is white just as in winter but the hair is extremely short over much of the body there is no more than a scanty covering of tightly curled wool which presumably would develop later into a dense body covering completely hidden by the long straight hairs of the winter coat oreamnos montanus columbianus was described from the shesley mountains in the same general region and some sixty or seventy miles north of the place where our specimen was taken see allen 1904 p 20 mountain goats occur on the mountains along the mainland coast of southeastern alaska directly to the westward of this region and with very little doubt at all suitable places between whether or not the subspecies columbianus extends westward to the coast we have not the material to decide though the specimens at hand suggest otherwise there are three specimens available from the coast of southeastern alaska an adult female and two young males the old female has horns that are nearly as widespreading as in a female oreamnos kennedyi from cook inlet of about the same age they are more widespreading than in our adult male from the telegraph creek region these are the only comparisons that it is feasible to make this material thus suggests the possibility at least of the existence of a coastal race kennedyi as distinct from columbianus of the interior in all probability kennedyi should be regarded as a subspecies of oreamnos montanus rather than a distinct species there is with little doubt sufficiently continuous distribution of mountain goats along the alaskan coast to insure intergradation between the several described forms and the goat occurring on the mainland of the sitkan region may well prove to be referable to kennedyi though perhaps not exhibiting the characters of that race in

reached the indifference with which the mergansers regarded their formidable pursuer none took the trouble to dive even except the one specifically selected as a victim then at the last moment that particular individual disappeared easily beneath the water leaving the eagle flounder ing and gathering himself for another try at the flock he soon gave up the task and the mergansers swam down stream out of our sight university of california publications in zoology vol 24 anas platyrhynchos linnaeus mallard a single bird seen june 12 in a beaver pond some five miles west of telegraph creek was the only indication we had that this species might be breeding in the upper stikine valley ducks are quiet and retiring during the nesting season however and we spent but little time in places where we would be apt to find them so that our negative results are no proof of the actual scarcity of this and some other species at sergief island august 17 to september 7 mallards were present in considerable numbers all that we shot proved to be young birds nettion carolinense gmelin green winged teal a pair was seen june 12 in a beaver pond some five miles west of telegraph creek at sergief

adult female september 5 no 39706 spatula clypeata linnaeus shoveller a single bird was seen at close range in a slough on sergief island on august 29 a peale falcon shot at the same locality on september 1 had the remains of a shoveller in its stomach dafila acuta linnaeus pintail seen only at sergief island there during the whole of our stay pintails were present in fair abundance usually in flocks of ten or twelve individuals these small flocks were presumably each a single family the three common fresh water ducks here were the mallard green winged teal and pintail of none of these species seen almost daily from august 17 to september 7 and in considerable numbers were any male birds seen in the normal adult winter plumage presumably the old males were still in the eclipse plumage but our efforts to obtain any failed those birds that we shot proved to be young of the year with one or two old females marila sp scaup duck flocks and single birds were several times seen on sawmill lake during june most of them were males on june 11 a flock was noted1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 199 consisting of ten males and one female suggestive of the possibility that the females were sitting on eggs nearby the birds were seen at close enough range to identify them as scaups but whether manila marila or m affirtis or both would of course have required the capture of specimens for determination m glaucionetta islandica gmelin barrow golden eye seen at various points within ten or twelve miles of telegraph creek at the summit june 4 and 5 a flock of five females and several single birds both male and female at sawmill lake occasionally during june and on a small stream south of telegraph creek two females were shot at the summit june 5 and one of them was preserved no 39707 these two birds were evidently not breeding the species encountered was apparently glaucionetta islandica the identity of the one specimen saved was determined mainly through a study of the characterization of the two forms americana and islandica as given by brooks 1920 p 356 this decision though is also influenced by the fact that the adult males seen were unquestionably islandica the triangular white facial patch being plainly discernible with the binoculars this is a curious instance in which the identity of a specimen in hand a normal adult female is confirmed by sight identification of others not obtained histrionicus histrionicus linnaeus harlequin duck not seen along the lower stikine river but fairly common along the upper part of the stream frequently observed at close range from the river boat always seen in swift water flying up when approached too nearly or perhaps swimming fearlessly through a swirl of rapids alongside paying little heed either to the boat from whose path it just withdrew or to the rocks and snags between which it picked its way seen as far up the river as telegraph creek oidemia deglandi bonaparte white winged scoter undoubtedly nesting on sawmill lake where varying numbers were seen during the month of june twenty or more of both sexes were noted on june 17 and lesser numbers on many other occasions not met with elsewhere 200 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 branta canadensis occidentalis baird white cheeked goose we were told of the occasional though rare occurrence of geese as far up the river as telegraph creek but it seems doubtful that birds seen so far inland should be occidentalis in our ascent of the stikine river may 21 and 22 flocks of geese presumably of this subspecies were seen at intervals about as far up as great glacier none was seen by us during the summer any farther inland when we camped at great glacier in august we found an abundance of old sign of the presence of geese many droppings on the sand bars about some shallow ponds and the marks of webbed feet in sticky mud that had since remained undisturbed the geese themselves had probably not visited the place for many weeks these ponds in a sheltered location apparently received a maximum of sunshine early in the summer and were correspondingly attractive to the birds at that time in our descent of the river the first white cheeked geese were seen at the boundary august 16 from there on down an occasional small flock was noted but not until the mouth of the river was reached were they seen in any numbers at sergief island they were abundant flocks of large size frequented the marshes at that point changing their feeding ground as the tides advanced and receded these local movements covered but a few miles at most and of course were gone through with daily as regularly as the tides aside from this hourly shifting which kept some flocks on the wing practically throughout the day there was no appearance of migration flocks of white cheeked geese were never seen to depart in a manner suggestive of the beginning of a long flight nor were any seen arriving as though from a distance during the last two weeks in august the geese were still molting extensively in some the breast and belly were almost entirely devoid of feathers only the down remaining and nearly all were renewing the tail feathers flight feathers were fully grown or at any rate sufficiently so for flying presumably the birds would not gather upon these open and exposed marshes until they could fly nesting and the beginning of the molt including loss of the remiges probably takes place in more sheltered localities five specimens of white cheeked geese were preserved an adult male and adult female saved entire nos 39708 39709 and two males and a female nos 39710 39712 of which head and neck only were preserved four of the five specimens preserved have more or less1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 201 indication of a black line on the chin separating the white cheek patches in one case this bar is fairly well defined though as each separate feather is narrowly edged with white and has a white base a mottled effect is produced in three the black is not continuous merely a string of disconnected black spots and in one the white patch extends uninterruptedly from cheek to cheek usually in the geese of this region there is either a string of disconnected spots as in the specimens just described or else a beginning of such a line extending forward and backward on the center of the throat but not meeting very rarely the black dividing line is continuous broad and well defined i myself have seen two such specimens but in neither case was there absolute assurance that they were birds breeding in the sitkan district such birds might occur as migrants from a more northern region where intergradation of occidentalis and minima might result in the occasional appearance of such a marking ardea herodias fannini chapman northwest coast heron only two seen during the entire summer one observed on a sand bar in the stikine river some eight miles below telegraph creek on july 5 may or may not have been of the coast subspecies fannini one was seen flying overhead on sergief island september 5 gallinago delicata ord wilson snipe seen only at sergief island at that point during the whole of our stay august 17 to september 7 wilson snipe were abundant on the marshes not generally distributed but always to be found about certain favored spots generally near fresh water ponds while the usual manner of occurrence was for a single bird to be flushed or perhaps two or three within a few square yards there were times when snipe were noted in small flocks almost like sandpipers in their actions groups of ten or twelve individuals were seen circling about through the air in close formation and wheeling or turning in perfect unison at such times almost the only thing to betray the identity of the birds was the call note uttered at frequent intervals at no time however did birds flushed from the ground depart in flock formation eight specimens were collected nos 39713 39720 taken on dates ranging from august 18 to september 1 11 ii ill j 202 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 pisobia maculata vieillot pectoral sandpiper seen only at sergief island upon our first visit to the marshes on august 18 pectoral sandpipers were seen in small numbers just a few single birds or at most two or three together they increased in numbers daily and by september 1 flocks of from twenty to thirty individuals were frequently encountered like the wilson snipe they favored the fresh water ponds and there they could be seen walking about through the short grass the flocks loosely spaced so that the individual birds were from ten to twenty feet apart they were tame and unsuspicious usually permitting a near approach three specimens preserved nos 39721 39723 pisobia minutilla vieillot least sandpiper seen only at sergief island where it was present in fair abundance the small size of the least sandpiper kept it out of the grassy areas frequented by some of the other waders and it was usually found on the bare mud banks or sand bars there were places however where the flocks of geese had trampled down the tall marsh grass sometimes acres in extent and the least sandpipers were fond of feeding in such spots where they could run about freely over the prostrate grass one specimen collected no 39724 totanus melanoleucus gmelin greater yellowlegs seen only at sergief island not abundant but a few single birds and sometimes two together were encountered at various times from august 19 to september 2 one specimen collected no 39725 totanus fiavipes gmelin lesser yellowlegs seen during june about sawmill lake and some smaller ponds near telegraph creek probably nesting somewhere within a few miles but apparently not in the immediate vicinity of these lakes occasionally one was seen coming down from a great height in the air evidently to feed on the shores of one or another of the lakes it seemed likely from the birds actions that the nesting grounds might have been in meadow land high up in some of the nearby mountains four specimens preserved all adults nos 39726 39729 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 203 tringa solitaria cinnamomea brewster western solitary sandpiper this species might be expected to breed throughout the region in which we were working but we failed to find it doing so it was met with but once during the summer an immature male no 39730 being secured at flood glacier on august 7 this individual a fully grown bird of the year was of course a migrant and might have traveled a long distance if im i actitis macularia linnaeus spotted sandpiper fairly common in the upper stikine valley a nest with four eggs was discovered at sawmill lake june 14 placed in a bank of sawdust on the site of the long abandoned sawmill at glenora a set of four eggs no 1806 was collected on july 3 the nest in this case was in a grassy meadow near an abandoned building another nest was found at glenora on a sand bar at the edge of the river at least one brood was hatched near our camp at doch da on creek no spotted sandpipers were seen farther down the river but there is no reason to doubt that the species occurs the whole length of the stikine it is known to be a summer visitant on the coast of southeastern alaska one specimen collected no 39731 an adult female taken at glenora with the set of eggs previously referred to oxyechus vociferus vociferus linnaeus killdeer on the evening of august 22 dixon heard the unmistakable notes of a killdeer from a mud bank in the river near our camp at sergief island search the next day and for several days thereafter failed to bring the bird to our sight but the call note is so distinctive that a person familiar with the species could not mistake it for any other luiin ib 1 dendragapus obscurus fiemingi taverner fleming grouse in summer at least this species is restricted to high altitudes in the mountains of the upper stikine region we met with it at but one point at timber line in the mountains above doch da on creek a female with a brood of small young was seen there at about 4000 feet elevation on july 11 on july 23 two broods were found near the university of california publications in zoology vol 24 same place the young ones the size of mountain quail oreortyx strong on the wing and apparently well able to care for themselves on july 11 a cock bird was flushed from the heather at the edge of a snow bank far above the timber another was seen by dixon at the upper edge of the timber on kirk s mountain on july 17 no males were heard hooting at any time of the two broods seen on july 23 one consisted of three young the second of but one these birds were found in open grassy patches close to dense and extensive thickets of prostrate balsam fir that afforded shelter from almost any enemy the parent of the brood of small young seen on july 11 was extremely solicitous for their safety she was not aggressive in her solicitude however as is the ruffed grouse under similar circumstances nor did she feign a broken wing or other disability she simply sat on the top of a thicket obviously greatly worried clucking nervously to the chicks until they had reached what she considered a safe distance when she followed after through the bushes the larger young ones seen on july 23 were evidently expected to look after themselves to a great extent they were as wary and resourceful as their parents five specimens were secured nos 39732 39736 two adult females and a male and two females in juvenal plumage these birds appear to belong to the subspecies dendragapus obscurus flemingi described by taverner 1914 p 385 from teslin lake one hundred and forty miles north of the stikine this form is most nearly related to d o richardsoni it is widely different from fuliginosus and sitkensis the coastal subspecies richardsoni and flemingi are not hooters the call note of the male bird is not the loud far reaching hoot that is so characteristic of fuliginosus and sitkensis and also of the california race sierrae in these latter subspecies the male bird has on each side of the neck an area of bare skin that is brilliant yellow greatly thickened and capable of wide distention part of the hooting apparatus and not highly developed in the non hooting forms see brooks 1912 p 252 this is a structural difference of sufficient importance to warrant the specific separation of these groups of grouse whether or not d o obscurus of the southern rocky mountains is a hooter i do not know and any changes of nomenclature would hinge upon this fact flemingi is described as differing from richardsoni in darker general coloration and in having the tail rounded not truncate both are described as lacking a terminal tail band the general dark colora 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 205 tion including extension of dark areas and restriction of light ones is evident in the stikine birds as in topotypes of flemingi loaned me by the victoria memorial museum and is sufficiently marked to justify the recognition of flemingi it is doubtful whether the tail characters are valid the sharply truncate tail of the male richardsoni is a feature that is not acquired until the second year at least the young male the first year has the whole tail rounded and the individual tail feathers are narrow and rounded as compared with the broad truncate feathers of the old bird also richardsoni can hardly be said to lack entirely a terminal band on the tail an indication at least of this marking is always present dendragapus obscurus sitkensis swarth sitka grouse on may 21 on the trip up the river from wrangell we stopped at the canadian custom house just above the alaska british columbia boundary and while anchored there heard a grouse hooting in the nearby woods presumably this was the coast subspecies the only specimen collected during the summer was an adult female no 39737 taken by dixon at the southern end of mitkof island during a three days hunt for deer which he made to that point august 26 to 29 a number more were seen at the same place for the use of the name dendragapus obscurus sitkensis see swarth 1921a p 59 canachites canadensis osgoodi bishop alaska spruce grouse canachites canadensis atratus grinnell valdez spruce grouse from the reports we heard it is to be inferred that the spruce grouse is of general distribution in the region we visited and in fair abundance though locally restricted to suitable surroundings we were informed that about telegraph creek this grouse was usually found in the spruce forests on the hillsides well up above the river valley we ourselves met with the species at but two points late in the evening of july 5 as we were returning to our camp at glenora a young spruce grouse flew up into a tree by the road and was taken it was still partly in the natal down too young to be supposed to be shifting for itself but neither the parent nor any other of the brood was seen at flood glacier an adult female and one chick were taken on august 4 an adult male on august 7 no others were seen these birds were collected in dense spruce woods in the bottom lands between the river and the glacier the old male was feeding on huckleberries 206 university of california publications in zoology you hi of the specimens collected the adult male no 39740 august 7 had virtually completed the annual molt there are partly grown feathers over various parts but the old plumage is all discarded the adult female no 39739 august 4 is still mostly in the worn last year s plumage though feather renewal is in progress in some tracts the two young no 39741 male glenora july 5 no 39738 female flood glacier august 4 are at precisely the same stage of development though taken just a month apart the natal down persists upon head throat and belly and the juvenal feathers clothe the back breast flanks and wings the two adults are noticeably different from examples of canachites c osgoodi from points in the interior of the latter i have had for comparison specimens from various points in northern british columbia yukon and alaska osgoodi described from lake marsh some 250 miles north of telegraph creek is a grayish colored bird compared with other races of c canadensis a character that becomes more and more accentuated to the northward birds from the kowak river region reach the extreme of differentiation in this regard see grinnell 1900 p 30 our flood glacier adults are extremely dark colored matching exactly examples of the coastal race canachites c atratus from prince william sound alaska grinnell 1910 p 380 c c atratus was not admitted to the check list by the a o u committee 1912 p 385 its characters being deemed insufficient for recognition but it seems to me to be a recognizable form the inference resulting from the capture of our stikine birds is that that race of spruce grouse will prove to be of continuous distribution in the coastal district between the stikine river and prince william sound the two young birds from glenora and flood glacier respectively are somewhat different in appearance the glenora bird is more grayish in coloration the flood glacier specimen more rufescent and with more extensive black areas upon individual feathers these differences might pass unnoted perhaps were it not for the peculiarities of the flood glacier adults as compared with typical adult osgoodi as it is i believe the observed differences in the juvenals to be of significance for they are just the sort of differences that would be expected to distinguish the young of atratus and osgoodi the glenora juvenal may be an example of canachites c osgoodi this indicates the possible presence of two forms of canachites canadensis in the stikine valley as is the case with so many other species of birds c c osgoodi of the interior extending westward at least to glenora c c atratus of the coast extending inland at least to flood glacier 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 207 bonasa umbellus umbelloides douglas gray ruffed grouse fairly common in the poplar forests of the upper stikine valley we ourselves saw none below doch da on creek but the species undoubtedly ranges farther down stream regularly we were told of its occasional occurrence at the mouth of the river but whether breeding or merely in winter i do not know during the first week in june single birds were several times seen at the junction three that were shot at this point were all males the females were undoubtedly sitting on eggs at that time on june 12 the first young were seen two broods being encountered near telegraph creek the young of one brood were still unable to fly our first knowledge of their presence was derived from the mother bird who burst forth from the bushes and charged us furiously she kept tail and ruff widely spread the head crest depressed she was mewling in a very catlike fashion and also hissing from time to time there was an occasional faint peep from the grass nearby and once i caught a glimpse of a yellow chick slipping away through the shrubbery but the young were too agile to be captured the young of the second brood were somewhat larger and able to fly this second mother tried to toll us away from the chicks by feigning a broken wing the noise she made was not unlike the whining of a small puppy her actions all together gave the impression that she was frightened rather than angry however if frightened she still did not desert her trust but remained nearby dragging herself back and forth across the road with wings drooping and all her feathers pressed closely against her body her tail was not spread nor were her ruffs displayed at any time all in striking contrast to the behavior of the first bird met that morning from later observations it appeared that these two parents were fairly typical of their kind in such an emergency the mother either charged the intruder viciously in an apparent attempt to frighten him or else she endeavored to distract attention from the chicks to herself by feigning injury and inviting pursuit on one occasion the parent of a brood came charging at me through the woods from a distance of fifty yards at doch da on creek july 8 to 26 ruffed grouse were seen on many occasions on july 15 an adult male was shot that proved to be in the midst of the molt only one or two of the old rectrices were left and the body was covered with pin feathers on july 18 the last

in juvenal plumage and one in natal down nos 39742 39747 these birds are relatively gray colored but not so ashy as bonasa um bettus yukonensis from the yukon region see grinnell 1916 p 166 i have had for comparison three specimens of bonasa u umbeuoides from points on the saskatchewan and athabasca rivers alberta practically topotypes of that form loaned me by the united states biological survey the stikine river birds are of exactly the same type of coloration of our series of five adults three are in the gray phase two in the red apparently these color phases occur throughout the entire range of the species bonasa umbellus the point arises as to whether the confusion that exists between the subspecies umbeuoides and togata cf a 0 u committee 1910 p 140 a relatively gray race and a relatively reddish one is not largely due to a misunderstanding of the color variation within any one subspecies no attempt has been made by me to go thoroughly into this question but it may be said that the reddest umbeuoides examined is a very different looking bird indeed from the few grouse i have seen from eastern canada the habitat of the reddish colored togata the crop contents of two

several winters trapping on the iskut river some miles above the junction of jhe latter with the stikine and he told us that at times ptarmigan were plentiful there during the winter months he described them as of two species one smaller and entirely white obviously leucurus the other larger and with black feathers in the tail the latter was evidently either rupestris or lagopus both

glacier no 39757 may or may not have been hatched in that immediate neighborhood no other goshawks were seen there and other species of hawks pigeon hawks and sharp shinned hawks were at that time beginning to appear apparently migrating at any rate this individual appears to be an example of the western subspecies a a striatulus it is closely matched by four young of striatulus from their nesting ground in the warner mountains california and it is quite unlike a series of six immatures of atricapillus from the yukon region compared with the yukon series the flood glacier bird is darker colored throughout it is more heavily marked below and the brown edgings to the feathers dorsally are broader and of a darker brown specimens of striatulus taken on the coast of southern alaska during the migrations are closely similar to the flood glacier bird buteo borealis calurus cassin western red tailed hawk red tailed hawks were seen at several points in the interior but never in any numbers two or three were noted near telegraph creek at close enough range to enable their rufous tails to be distinguished some dark colored hawks supposed to be of this species were seen at iff 1 111 111 eh 1212 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 a distance at glenora july 1 an extremely dark individual was seen the body almost black this again was identified by means of the characteristic tail color others were observed at doch da on creek during july all the birds of this species seen thus far had been either in the dark phase or else were light breasted birds that were not notably light colored otherwise then at flood glacier a family of extremely light colored individuals was encountered on july 26 and on subsequent days an adult red tail was several times seen from our camp sometimes perched in a tall spruce sometimes flying past the breast and belly of this bird appeared to be gleaming white and the back seemed to have much white spotting on july 31 dixon found this adult feeding two full grown young ones in an opening in the forest though the parent was too wary to be captured he took both the immatures these like the old one are extremely light colored chin throat and breast are continuously white the breast with a buffy suffusion and the lower abdomen and lower tail coverts are white in the spotted tract across the middle of the body below and on the flanks the dark spots are relatively small and separated by wide areas of white the area immediately surrounding the eye and between eye and bill is white in the feathers on the top of head and back of neck are small central spots of black or dusky and extensive basal and marginal areas of white over the entire upperparts the feathers are extensively white spotted and with broad margins of white or pale buffy in a large series of young calurus from various parts of the western united states we have nothing at all like these birds an immature male borealis from wisconsin is like the stikine river specimens in the uniformly white chin throat and breast and in the restriction of the black spots below but it is not so white on the head and upperparts buteo borealis krideri has been recorded from alaska on the basis of a light colored bird taken at eagle during the winter of 1903 b h bailey 1916 p 321 the red tails however form a puzzling aggregation of geographical races and color phases and it does not simplify matters in this case to assign to the subspecies krideri a range covering part of the habitat of calurus the present writer is disinclined to regard the light colored birds just described as examples of krideri thereby extending the range of that form far to the westward most of the red tails seen throughout the stikine region were of the recognized calurus type until the meaning of the diverse phases of1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 213 plumage seen is thoroughly understood it is safer to regard all the birds of that part of the country as of the one subspecies calurus of the two young birds collected the female had crop and stomach filled to distention in the partly digested mass there could be distinguished the remains of at least four mice and one toad the mice could be identified as microtus mordax the male bird had its stomach filled with a mass of microtus bones and hair the meadow mice that the young hawks had eaten must all have been fed to them by their parents while microtus mordax was a fairly common species at that point still it is noteworthy that a red tailed hawk should be sufficiently agile to catch so many of them in as short a space of time as must have been the case the mice in the river bottom where the hawks were found were in cover so dense that it was surprising to find a red tail there at all the hunting of the latter may of course have been done on the nearby mountain sides above the denser timber but even so it seems rather remarkable that they should find so little difficulty in catching these small rodents mm buteo swainsoni bonaparte swainson hawk seen only in the vicinity of telegraph creek a number of dark colored hawks were observed thereabout some of which were identified as red tails while others of lighter build were assumed to be of the present species dixon shot one on june 1 but was unable to find the bird until two days later when it was unfit to preserve as a specimen one wing one leg and the tail were preserved no 39760 to make identification certain the birds seen were undoubtedly nesting near by aquila chrysaetos linnaeus golden eagle one seen at fairly close range near telegraph creek on june 22 another at glenora july 7 haliaeetus leucocephalus alascanus c h townsend northern bald eagle in all probability bald eagles extend inland much farther than the points where we were collecting dependent perhaps upon local conditions but we ourselves did not see any farther up the river than doch da on creek here the latter part of july they were noted on several occasions on july 23 two were seen circling above the mountain tops at about 5000 feet altitude descending the stikine from doch da on creek bald eagles were seen at various points 214 university of california publications in zoology you 24 on our trip up the river in early may many nests were noted along the lower parts of the stream easy to see at that season as the trees were still bare of leaves on our return trip in august the abundant foliage hid most of the structures but one at least was noted on august 16 with a young bird still sitting on the edge of the nest at sergief island bald eagles were seen daily if falco peregrinus pealei ridgway peale falcon one shot on the marsh at sergief island on september 1 this bird an immature of the year differs appreciably from the mode of young anatum as represented by specimens from various parts of north america the main difference consists in the sergief island specimen being more heavily marked beneath in its almost totally lacking the cinnamon tinge below that is so characteristic of anatum and in the lack of paler edgings to the feathers of the upperparts this falcon contained in its stomach the remains of a shoveller spatula clypeata falco columbarius columbarius linnaeus pigeon hawk not seen until the latter part of the summer when the migration had begun if the species breeds throughout the region we were exploring it is to be supposed that the birds are few in numbers and in widely scattered pairs first seen at our flood glacier camp august 1 next on our way down the river to the great glacier august 8 on sergief island the latter part of august and the first week in september pigeon hawks were seen almost daily but they were wary and seldom came within shooting distance two specimens were secured a female at great glacier august 14 no 39762 and a male no 39763 at sergief island september 2 both are immatures the sergief island bird is an average example of columbarius at that stage the great glacier specimen is darker colored below it is indistinguishable from columbarius but dorsally it is about as dark as examples of immature suckleyi from vancouver island on the whole it is best referred to columbarius falco sparverius sparverius linnaeus american sparrow hawk seen from time to time in the vicinity of telegraph creek generally not far from the river there were probably several pairs nesting within a few miles of the town at doch da on creek in july 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 215 sparrow hawks were seen several times on july 11 one was observed at about 3000 feet altitude sitting on a tall dead stub on a burnt over hillside on july 23 an adult female was secured at the upper limits of timber about 4000 feet at flood glacier august 5 a sparrow hawk was seen several times swooping at a bald eagle that spent that day moping in the rain on the top of a dead tree near our camp at sergief island sparrow hawks were noted on several occasions the only previously reported occurrences of this bird in southeastern alaska seem to have been the capture of one on the lower taku river september 16 1909 swarth 1911 p 63 and the observation of two at craig prince of wales island willett 1921 p 128 but it is probable that the sparrow hawk is of fairly regular occurrence in the fall at some points on the southern alaskan coast the bird taken at doch da on creek no 39764 an adult female is essentially like the taku river specimen referred to also a female they are both noticeably dark colored as compared with california birds with broader black cross bars on the dorsal surface and with the rufous areas of a darker shade it seems safe to say that the sparrow hawk as occurring in this general region is a bird of the interior and that a few individuals find their way to the coast in the dispersal that takes place in the late summer or early fall such migrants would be likely to wander down some large river valley that extends from one region to the other and it is near the lower ends of such valleys that most of the birds thus far recorded have been seen wf iii asio flammeus pontoppidan short eared owl one seen on the marshes of sergief island on september 2 presumably a migrant from some other place as these same marshes had been assiduously hunted over for two weeks previously without seeing any of this species it is fair to assume that the bird noted represented the arrival of its kind at this point on the southward flight mil cryptoglaux funerea richardsoni bonaparte richardson owl one specimen a young bird molting into first winter plumage obtained in dense spruce woods at flood glacier july 28 this species presumably of general distribution throughout northern british columbia is a bird of the interior not known to occur in the humid coast belt and our specimen may be assumed to have been taken at the extreme western limit of its range in this region u 216 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 iii bubo virginianus subsp horned owl horned owls occur throughout the country we were visiting but apparently not in abundance at least during the summer months we were told of their presence at telegraph creek but we saw none nor did we hear any hooting at doch da on creek we were shown the desiccated remains of one that had been killed the previous winter on sergief island august 31 i found a horned owl s feather in the marsh far from the timber at the latter point the subspecies present is doubtless bubo v saturatus i had no means of ascertaining the subspecific identity of the horned owl of the upper stikine river if i j fill glaucidium gnoma subsp pigmy owl one seen at doch da on creek on july 14 sitting on a dead tree in a clearing i had a good enough view of the bird to be certain of its specific identity but it was too wary to permit a near approach on july 22 one was heard calling at about the same place there is available a specimen of glaucidium no 41193 a mounted bird taken at wrangell alaska date of capture and sex unknown this bird is not an example of the extremely dark colored glaucidium gnoma swarthi of vancouver island a coastal form that might be supposed to range northward into alaska it is closely similar to a specimen of g g grinnelli from humboldt bay california no 24851 an individual that is not of the rufeseent coloration usually seen in this subspecies but of a decidedly duller brown the available information scanty as it is indicates the occurrence of glaucidium in the upper stikine valley and on the alaska coast at the mouth of the same river there is little doubt that it ranges through the territory intervening between those two points whether or not two subspecies are represented in the two regions on either side of the coastal mountains is something that can be determined only by the capture of specimens ceryle alcyon caurina grinnell western belted kingfisher kingfishers were unaccountably scarce the region might be supposed to be a favorable one for the species but it was encountered on just two occasions one bird seen at doch da on creek july 17 and another at flood glacier july 28 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 217 w dryobates villosus montieola anthony rocky mountain hairy woodpecker the only species of woodpecker that was at all common in the region about telegraph creek there were but few of the birds seen in may and in early june but by the middle of june when the young were beginning to fly hairy woodpeckers were encountered rather frequently farther down the river they were decidedly scarce a few were seen at doch da on creek at flood glacier one bird was taken and one other was heard calling two occupied nests were found near telegraph creek one discovered june 11 contained nearly full grown young which could be seen at the entrance calling for food this nest was in a partly dead poplar about twenty feet from the ground the second found in an exactly similar situation on june 12 contained one young bird which left at the first disturbance by the third week in june the nesting season seemed to be entirely over and the young were flying about independently of their parents an adult male shot june 19 was beginning to molt new remiges have appeared at the junction of primaries and secondaries and there are new feathers along the center line of the breast and abdomen hairy woodpeckers may be expected to occur continuously along the stikine river thus bringing the subspecies montieola and sitkensis together unfortunately the birds are so rare along the lower river as in the southeastern alaskan coast region in general that it is difficult to get enough specimens to ascertain the nature of conditions where the two meet we failed to see any at all at the crucial point sitkensis in its relatively light ventral coloration is intermediate between the extremely dark harrisi and the white breasted montieola the dark breasted type of coloration reaches its extreme development in picoideus of the queen charlotte islands interposed between the ranges of harrisi and sitkensis thus while specimens of sitkensis as laid out in trays may be arranged to illustrate a step between harrisi and montieola the geographical distribution of the several forms is not in accordance with this idea the geographical chains appear to lie as follows starting with the white breasted races of the interior of the northwest septentrionalis and montieola there is an extension westward on the coast of a slightly darker breasted race sitkensis starting again with the dark breasted type harrisi of the puget sound region and going northward we reach the extremely dark i ww 218 university of california publications in zoology you 24 ii 1 f colored picoideus thus sitkensis and harrisi are really far apart genetically and the appearance of sitkensis as a seeming intergrade between montieola and harrisi must be explained on grounds other than those of such actual intermediate relationship sitkensis as an offshoot of the white breasted type of the interior may have arrived at the humid coast at too recent a date to be yet affected by its surroundings to the extent that harrisi and picoideus have been or it may be more resistant to such an environment in either case the slight modification of the clear white breast of montieola produced by the humid surroundings would result in an apparent intergrade toward harrisi in this connection it may be remarked that the highly distinctive avifauna of the southeastern alaskan coast is for the most part composed of species that occur on the pacific coast farther south and extend northward along a narrow coastal strip more or less modified in appearance most of these birds extend farther north than does the hairy woodpecker of the same region cyanocitta stelleri penthestes rufescens junco oreganus and the coastal forms of melospiza melodia are all birds of this type and they all occur farther north than does dryobates villosus sitkensis the latter apparently belongs to ah aggregation of bird species that has more recently invaded the coast from the eastward along a few favorable avenues of approach the northern limit reached in such cases would be governed by the chance terminus of the route that happened to open up from the eastward with of course later extension from the new base other species in this same category are dryobates pubesce ns piranga ludoviciana bombycilia cedrorum empidonax trailli and perhaps geothlypis trichas these birds are for the most part not nearly so abundant in the coastal region nor are they so evenly distributed as species of the first category listed fourteen specimens of dryobates villosus montieola were collected nos 39766 39779 eleven adults and three young twelve are from telegraph creek one from doch da on creek and one from flood glacier sphyrapicus varius varius linnaeus yellow bellied sapsucker on june 18 an adult male was taken immediately after this bird was shot its mate appeared and disclosed the location of the nest on june 19 another male bird was taken within half a mile of where the first was shot this was about five miles from telegraph creek the nest referred to was twenty five feet from the ground in a dead birch 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 219 in rather open woods the cavity appeared to be newly finished and was empty the two birds at the nest drew attention to their presence by their raucous call notes screams worthy of a large hawk the second specimen collected was traced through his noisy drumming upon a dead limb these three sapsuckers were the only ones that were seen near telegraph creek the first one obtained no 39780 is close to typical varius it has no red on the nape and the red chin and throat patch is separated from the white subauricular stripe by a strip of black these characters being just as in varius it has less white on the back than most eastern examples of varius but there is one specimen available from illinois that resembles it closely taken by itself this specimen would pass unquestioned as an example of varius the mate of this bird was not obtained but it was seen for a brief moment close enough to note that it had a great deal of red about the head almost obliterating the black pectoral patch the one collected on june 19 no 39781 has the red nuchal stripe and the red of the chin and throat has obliterated the black malar stripe invaded the white sub auricular stripe beyond and covers the entire black pectoral patch in the latter marking the black feathers are tipped with red the posterior border of this patch is sharply defined against the whitish belly the dorsal region is but scantily spotted with white it is just such a specimen as taken in winter in california would be defined as an example of nuchalis showing a decided leaning toward ruber ridgway 1914 regards varius and ruber as specifically distinct in the upper stikine valley the two forms do appear to meet as separate species but intergradation through individual variation occurs elsewhere and by that criterion the two should be regarded as subspecies of one species a parallel case in the stikine region is found in the thrushes hylocichla ustulata ustulata and h u swainsoni the facts derived from our specimens of sphyrapicus are as follows at telegraph creek we took one typical example of varius and one bird that has more the appearance of a hybrid between two species varius and ruber than an intergrade between two such forms regarded as subspecies at doch da on creek some fifty miles down the river we collected specimens of ruber specimens absolutely typical of that form see postea p 220 we have here no series of intergrades difficult of allocation and from an intermediate region there are instead examples of two extremes varius and ruber nesting within a short distance of each other the one doubtful specimen does not accord with i ri ill 24 220 university of california publications in zoology vol 2 typical nuchalis but has all the appearance of what a hybrid should be between two distinct species varius and ruber presumably the form nuchalis does not occur this far north m lii me si 1 1 sphyrapicus varius ruber gmelin red breasted sapsucker five specimens taken at doch da on creek during july two adult males one juvenal male and two juvenal females nos 39782 39786 probably several pairs had nested within the area we covered in this region for the birds were encountered at widely separated points there were certain favored spots one clump of willows and one large birch in particular where one or more sapsuckers were seen almost every time we passed these trees showed large areas of scars the results of assiduous work by the sapsuckers for a considerable period of time the five birds taken are typical examples of the dark colored northern race of the red breasted sapsucker sphyrapicus v ruber this locality doch da on creek may be regarded as the easternmost limit of ruber in this region yet the race persists in typical form to this extreme boundary there is no indication of intergradation with varius or nuchalis at this margin of its habitat such as might be expected to occur the relationships of the three forms varius nuchalis and ruber present an unsolved problem whether we regard them as species or subspecies as between ruber and daggetti however there is gradual intergradation exhibited by specimens from intermediate points such as we are accustomed to see in most geographic races or subspecies colaptes auratus borealis ridgway boreal flicker fairly common in the vicinity of telegraph creek but so shy and wary as readily to elude observation the call note was frequently heard but days might pass during which none of the birds was seen usually they kept out of gunshot the few obtained were taken in dense poplar thickets where the birds were sometimes observed feeding on the ground on june 14 a nest was found containing one egg on june 15 a female was shot with partly formed eggs in the ovary none had been laid as yet on june 17 a nest was found containing newly hatched young this was in the broken stub of a dead birch about ten feet from the ground 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 221 3ifvs3 a few flickers were seen in the woods about glenora perhaps one or two daily at doch da on creek a few were seen at long intervals none was observed any farther down the river three specimens were obtained nos 39787 39789 all adult females two from telegraph creek and one from glenora specifically they are all purely of the yellow shafted auratus type as regards color and markings none shows any admixture of cafer characteristics though the breeding ground of the northwest subspecies of that species colaptes cafer cafer2 approaches this region very closely no red shafted flickers were seen by us at any point though cafer may be expected to ascend the stikine for some distance subspecifically the large size of these birds places them with the form colaptes

one was seen flying overhead and soon after the birds became common the species was about as numerous at glenora at doch da on creek it occurred in lesser numbers none was seen farther down the river three sets of eggs were taken nos 1807 1809 on june 20 a single fresh egg an incomplete set was found near telegraph creek laid on the bare ground in open woods the female shot before the egg was found contained a second egg nearly ready to be laid a set of two eggs slightly incubated was taken june 26 in the same tract of woods this was an area that had been burned over leaving a scattering growth of small lodgepole pines with but little underbrush between a third set was collected at doch da on creek july 18 these were incubated within a few days of hatching the eggs were placed on the bare ground in an open place in the woods on all sides some thirty or forty yards distant there was dense brush but the ground was open in the immediate vicinity of the eggs 2 por the use of this name for the northwestern flicker see palmer 1916 p 322 222 3 ibfil university of california publications in zoology you 24 the parent of the second set was extremely solicitous of their safety she flew as we approached coming toward us with a peculiarly halting and uncertain flight with her tail depressed until it pointed almost straight down and with her mouth open alighting near by she wallowed on the ground thus luring us in pursuit for about twenty or thirty yards then flew off in a circle through the woods the parent of the set at doch da on creek acted quite differently she left the eggs while the intruder was still some distance away departing quietly and without any manifestations of solicitude in just twenty minutes she returned as secretively as she had left this course of action was followed without variation on three different occasions four specimens were collected nos 39790 39793 two adult males and two adult females to my eye they are indistinguishable from specimens of chordeiles v virginianus from the eastern united states ii ii i m ii cypseloides niger borealis kennerly black swift a few seen about six miles from telegraph creek on june 12 circling overhead just out of gun shot from this circumstance the species may be assumed to breed somewhere in that general region one or two were observed at glenora early in july the next place the species was noted was at great glacier where on the morning of august 9 a flock of fifteen or more was seen at sergief island august 17 to september 7 black swifts were abundant though seen only in cloudy or rainy weather then large flocks appeared as many as seventy five or a hundred being in sight at once flying over the marshes the individuals moving about in wide circles and the flock as a whole moving in a definite path the birds sometimes flew very low occasionally skimming along just over the tall grass a flock would appear circle about overhead awhile and then vanish about fifteen or twenty minutes later others or perhaps the same flock would come in sight again compared with aeronautes and chaetura the flight of cypseloides at least as seen thus feeding is rather slow a steady sailing with relatively little fluttering of the wings a high rate of speed can be attained however so great that when individuals passed by in pursuit of one another the rush of their wings could be heard to a distance of two hundred yards or more a weak chattering note was uttered from time to time but mostly the birds were silent seventeen specimens were obtained at sergief island nos 39794 39810 five males and twelve females it might be supposed that ato pmj 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 223 series of specimens taken when these birds were collected august 19 30 would contain a large percentage of immatures but if such young birds are included in the lot they possessed no features either of internal anatomy or external coloration that enabled me definitely to recognize them as such according to drew 1882 p 182 the young of this species is appreciably different from the adult in coloration the dark feathers being extensively white tipped both above and below of the five males two have extremely faint light colored tips to the feathers of the lower abdomen and on the lower tail coverts one of the five has the tail very slightly forked in the others it is deeply indented of the twelve females one is uniformly dark colored it has no trace of any whitish tips to the feathers of the lower parts in the others such markings are present in varying degrees the dark colored female has a truncate tail just as do the others in every individual both male and female the sexual organs were clearly visible they were shrunken in size as would be expected in adults at that season but they were never difficult to see as is so often the case with young birds the birds collected had entirely finished the annual molt and were all in the new plumage chaetura vauxi j k townsend vaux swift on june 26 a single bird was noted some five miles from telegraph creek at doch da on creek the middle of july a few were seen on several different days at flood glacier august 3 and 5 several were observed flying low in the rain that was falling and all traveling down stream two specimens were collected nos 39811 39812 an adult male and an adult female taken at doch da on creek on july 16 and 14 respectively selasphorus rufus gmelin rufous hummingbird seen at every collecting station but nowhere in abundance the species was at telegraph creek at the time of our arrival may 23 at that time it was restricted to the near vicinity of the river where there were already some flowers in bloom on the higher slopes the vegetation was not so far advanced and the hummingbirds were absent a nest found at doch da on creek july 10 was in a clump of large timber built near the tip of a spruce limb about five feet from the ground the outer surface of the structure was well covered with 111 hi224 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 lichens attention was drawn to this nest by the sudden flight of the two young birds it contained when approached too closely during the second week in july a female hummingbird was repeatedly seen in the vicinity of our camp on the 14th a male bird was seen going through his courtship flight associated with this same female so nesting may have been going on at that date in the courting flight the male bird rose slowly to a height of about sixty feet then swooped down and swung up again for a very short distance a diagram showing the course of this evolution would be about the shape of a fishhook when the lowest point was reached three or four rasping notes were uttered the evolution finished he slowly arose once more and repeated the performance this was done five or six times when he lit on a nearby limb for a hummingbird to appear as a menace to a farm crop was a new role for a member of that family but we heard one such complaint of damage done mr w e parrott of sergief island had a large strawberry patch the fruit of which he marketed in the nearby town of wrangell time and again so he told us he had seen a hummingbird dash at one of the bright red berries apparently under the impression that it was a flower and the bird s bill would be thrust through the fruit which of course was ruined he had found a number of berries pierced in this way and was puzzled to account for the damage until he saw a hummingbird in the act two specimens were preserved nos 39813 39814 these are adult males taken at glenora june 29 and july 3 respectively sayornis sayus bonaparte say phoebe several pairs seen on the upper stikine river at telegraph creek at least two pairs were domiciled on different houses in the town on june 6 one pair was seen at work nest building on a beam over the entrance to hyland s store at glenora june 29 a nest with young was found in one of the deserted houses of the hudson s bay company a day or two later the birds were gone and search of the adjoining fields failed to disclose their presence evidently the brood had at once traveled some distance on august 21 an immature female was collected on sergief island perched on some drift far out on the marshes this i believe is the first time the species has been reported from the coast of southeastern alaska it is of course a transient perhaps no more than a straggler into that region the bird collected on sergief island had probably wandered there from the interior along the stikine river 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 225 sayornis sayus yukonensis was described by bishop 19006 p 115 from glacier white pass alaska as a northern form differing from s sayus sayus in darker coloration and in certain structural details the subspecies was denied recognition by the a 0 u committee 1901 p 312 nor has it been generally recognized since that time grinnell 1909a p 206 uses the name s s yukonensis for a specimen from forty mile yukon which is shown to exhibit the characters claimed for the race by bishop the young bird no 39815 collected by myself differs appreciably from juvenals from the southwest it is of darker coloration and has much less rufous on the upperparts thus agreeing with bishop s loc cit description of the juvenal plumage of yukonensis thus the two northern specimens of sayornis sayus in this museum are of a character to justify the recognition of s s yukonensis but the material is so scanty that rather than formally affix that name to these two individuals i prefer to let the description of their peculiarities rest as evidence for use at some future time when additional material has been acquired nuttallornis borealis swainson olive sided flycatcher there were a few pairs in the more open wooded country about telegraph creek the birds were extremely shy not permitting a near approach and their habit of perching in the tops of tall trees also aided in keeping them out of gun shot seen at but the one collecting station myiochanes richardsoni richardsoni swainson western wood pewee fairly common about telegraph creek first seen on may 27 a few days later present in numbers a female shot at glenora on july 7 had laid part of its set none seen farther down the river than glenora though as the species is known to occur in summer at some points on the coast of southeastern alaska swarth 1911 p 75 it might be expected to range through the entire stikine valley the birds were extremely shy they were partial to more sparsely wooded areas especially burnt over tracts where they perched upon dead trees affording a wide outlook in such places they could seldom be approached to within a hundred yards three specimens collected nos 39816 39818 one adult male and two adult females besides these birds there are in the museum collection specimens from the coast of southeastern alaska and from i il i ii iim hi226 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 vancouver island a northern race of this species has been designated by bishop 19006 p 116 as contopus richardsoni saturatus certain of the characters ascribed to this race may be discerned in some of the specimens from the several points indicated but these features seem all to be too inconstant to serve in differentiating a northern subspecies ilpilii empidonax difficilis difficilis baird western flycatcher seen nowhere along the upper stikine and the call note is sufficiently loud and characteristic to render it unlikely that we should have overlooked the bird if present one specimen an immature male no 39819 taken on sergief island august 19 w empidonax trailli alnorum brewster alder flycatcher occurs in some numbers in suitable willow and alder thickets as far down the river at least as doch da on creek one heard calling near telegraph creek may 23 none seen at the junction but at sawmill lake there were several pairs in the dense thickets bordering the water here at glenora and at doch da on creek our experience was the same the birds could be heard calling and occasionally one could be seen in flight through the bushes but their habitat was so impenetrable and the birds were so shy and wary that they were almost impossible to approach after leaving doch da on creek the alder flycatcher was seen on but one occasion on sergief island september 3 an immature female was collected in a tangle of alders the capture of this bird of course is no proof that the species breeds on that island though it has once been recorded from another point on the coast of southeastern alaska under circumstances apparently indicative of nesting swarth 1911 p 76 two specimens were collected an adult male near telegraph creek june 18 no 39820 and the young bird above mentioned no 39821 the adult somewhat resembles empidonax t trailli in its large bill and short wing but in general coloration and in character of wing bars it is clearly alnorum the young bird appears to be a typical example of alnorum empidonax hammondi xantus hammond flycatcher abundant on the upper stikine where it is largely a bird of the poplar woods near telegraph creek many were seen during the last1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 227 week in may usually sitting high up in the leafless poplars and conspicuous from their frequently reiterated sharp che bec like the other small flycatchers of the region they were extremely shy but through peculiarities of habit and habitat hammond flycatchers were more easily collected than some of the other species the olive sided flycatcher and wood pewee perched upon isolated lookout points could not be approached unawares the alder flycatcher was in tangled thickets not to be penetrated save with much labor and with the accompaniment of threshing branches and broken boughs the hammond flycatcher was mostly in woods that could be traversed with fair ease but which yet afforded some cover to the hunter the species was quite abundant at telegraph creek and at glenora and in lesser numbers at doch da on creek several were seen at flood glacier though whether the species breeds at that point we had no means of telling one was collected at great glacier august 10 a female shot near telegraph creek may 27 was incubating a set of eggs one collected june 1 had laid part of its set an adult male taken at glenora june 30 shows the beginning of the molt an adult female from flood glacier july 27 had renewed a large part of its plumage two specimens in juvenal plumage were taken at flood glacier august 3 and 6 a young bird from great glacier august 10 shows the beginning of the molt into the first winter plumage it is strange that the hammond flycatcher has not yet been found on the coast of southeastern alaska south of skagway it is abundant in the interior and approaches the coast quite nearly at some points it is also abundant in the coastal region farther south as on vancouver island consequently it is hard to understand the cause of its exclusion from the southern alaskan coast we collected ten specimens nos 39822 39831 seven adults and three juvenals empidonax wrighti baird wright flycatcher three specimens taken near telegraph creek this species was not to be distinguished from e hammondi in life in fact it was not until our return from the field when the entire collection was brought together that both species were found to be included in the series of small flycatchers collected consequently if there is any difference in local habitat between the two we failed to distinguish it the three birds taken were obtained at points where examples of hammondi were also collected 14p mm life lil i ill 228

reported from wilson creek near lake atlin about 150 miles north of our station and as far as i know the northernmost point of record e m anderson 1915a p 13 the specimens we took are typical examples of the species presenting all the characters of measurements and proportions that distinguish wrighti from hammondi no equivocal specimens were collected that is none that could not be referred without question to one species or the other otocoris alpestris arcticola oberholser pallid horned lark seen in small numbers on the mountain tops above doch da on creek there on july 11 and again on july 23 they were found on the open moss covered slopes above timber line associated with rosy finches and pipits this station is in a straight line not more than sixty miles from the coast farther to the westward than horned larks have been found in this region heretofore from the mountain we were on however we could see many similar peaks and ridges far to the westward where the species would probably be found could these summits be reached these mountains are so steep and rough with such impenetrable forests at the lower levels and toward the coast so frequently encircled by glaciers that their ascent at most places is extremely difficult horned larks may well occur at favorable points but a few miles back from the coast but the circumstances are such that it is doubtful if this possible habitat will soon be invaded by any collector we collected four specimens nos 39835 39838 two adult males one adult female and one juvenal male the two adult males taken july 23 are beginning the annual molt shown mostly in the wing coverts the young bird taken july 23 is in juvenal plumage throughout compared with the young of various of the southwestern subspecies of otocoris alpestris it is extremely dark colored ground color of the upper parts is blackish throat and lower belly are white and there is hardly a trace of rufous or vinaceous anywhere 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine reg ton 229 cyanocitta stelleri stelleri gmelin steller jay closely restricted to the coastal region on our way down stream we saw the first steller jay at flood glacier some forty miles up the river from the boundary at that point one was noted on july 26 another on august 1 at great glacier about ten miles above the boundary two were observed together on august 11 and proved to be both adult males the species is sufficiently conspicuous and noisy to draw attention to itself when present and as the above records constitute all of our observations on the upper river it is obvious that this jay is of relatively uncommon occurrence in that region at sergief island many were seen sometimes under circumstances suggesting migration they were frequently in small gatherings seven or eight together and often on the tidal marshes far from timber apparently traveling in a definite direction when thus seen they were flying by easy stages from one drift log to another in a southerly direction an adult female no 39839 taken at flood glacier august 1 is in the midst of the annual molt two adult males taken at great glacier august 11 nos 39840 39841 are in the new plumage throughout two immatures from sergief island nos 39842 39843 obtained on august 23 and 31 respectively are likewise through the molt and have fully acquired their first winter plumage these birds are all typical stelleri those taken the farthest inland evidently represent extreme points of dispersal from the coast there is no evidence that cyanocitta stelleri stelleri in this region extends inland to the habitat of c s annectens with intergradation between the two forms annectens probably does not range so far north in british columbia 1 i 19 151 111111 mail perisoreus canadensis canadensis linnaeus canada jay when we arrived at telegraph creek the fourth week in may this species was through with its nesting it was not a common bird nor was it ordinarily noisy or conspicuous family groups old and young together were seen at several points between telegraph creek and the summit and single individuals were occasionally encountered slipping quietly through the woods this jay was one of several species that appeared to be restricted during the breeding season to a higher zone than that immediately bordering the stikine river none was seen nearer the river than the junction a point four miles north of telegraph creek several 230 university of califorma publications in zoology you 24 m mi um fill hundred feet higher in altitude and about two weeks later in the development of the vegetation on june 4 at the summit a gathering of jays was encountered composed of at least two broods the old birds were busily engaged in feeding the young though the latter were also foraging a little for themselves we did not see the species either at glenora or doch da on creek but it can hardly be doubted that it occurs at both places there was at least one brood in the woods about our camp at flood glacier the forest at that point is not of the type most favored by this species being almost entirely dense spruce woods such as are seen along the coast and it is questionable whether the occurrence there of this family of perisoreus can be assumed to represent a breeding record none was seen farther down the river individuals taken the last week in may and the first week in june had in several cases already begun the annual molt two adults taken at flood glacier on july 28 were in the midst of this molt two young birds taken at the same place july 28 and august 6 are molting from the juvenal into the first winter plumage there have been available for comparison a series of adult peri soreu s canadensis canadensis from minnesota and old and young of p c fumifrons from the kotzebue sound and yukon river regions alaska the stikine river adults are similar to fumifrons in general body color but have more white on the crown they resemble canadensis in head markings but are rather darker colored the young birds from the stikine region are distinctly darker colored more of a slaty black as compared with the juvenals from kotzebue sound and the yukon river this dark type of coloration is a character ascribed to the young of p c canadensis by ridgway 1904 p 366 on the whole the stikine river series may be assigned to the subspecies perisoreus canadensis canadensis though showing a tendency toward p c fumifrons we collected thirteen specimens of the canada jay nos 39844 39856 five adults and four juvenals from points within twelve miles of telegraph creek and two adults and two juvenals from flood glacier corvus corax principalis ridgway northern raven probably occurs throughout this whole region but judging from our observations not abundant at any point we were at telegraph creek three weeks before we saw one the first was noted on june 17 and afterwards others were seen on several occasions at doch da on1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 231 creek ravens were occasionally observed and at great glacier several were seen there were a few at sergief island seen from time to time or heard croaking in the distance corvus brachyrhynchos caurinus baird northwest crow seen only at sergief island here during the latter part of august and the first week in september crows were fairly abundant usually in small flocks young birds were still being cared for by their parents and the gatherings seen were apparently family groups though sometimes two broods may have joined forces this bird is strictly a beach comber apparently not venturing inland any distance whatever we saw none above the mouth of the river no specimens were taken this form appears in the a 0 u check list as a distinct species but it should be regarded as a subspecies of corvxis brachyrhynchos cf rhoads 1893 pp 18 21 ridgway 1904 p 272 oberholser 1919a p 84 euphagus carolinus miiller rusty blackbird breeding in the vicinity of telegraph creek there were several pairs nesting about sawmill lake at different points not in any one gathering or colony a female shot june 11 was incubating eggs at doch da on creek the species was seen about some swampy meadows and lakes during the latter part of july when young birds full grown though still in the juvenal plumage throughout were being cared for by their parents the young sat in the willows while the adults were foraging through the swamps for the food that was hurried back to the squalling youngsters as rapidly as it was found seen at one other collecting station on sergief

hue of the feather tips pinicola enucleator fiammula homeyer kadiak pine grosbeak apparently rather rare in summer in the upper stikine valley we saw single birds or pairs at scattered points and at long intervals of time they were always shy and it was with difficulty that specimens were taken i i232 university of california publications in zoology you 24 ill 1 111 iii iii iii iii at the junction single red colored males were seen may 27 29 and 31 another was noted some five miles west of telegraph creek june 12 at doch da on creek a mated pair was taken july 9 apparently preparing to nest on july 17 at the same place a flock of seven or eight was encountered feeding near the ground in some thick bushes on july 14 a brilliant red male was seen on july 22 a dull colored male was secured the last mentioned was in full song it was beyond doubt a breeding bird on august 2 at flood glacier a red male was seen singing in a tree top near camp five specimens collected nos 39867 39871 two adult males from the junction may 29 and 31 the mated pair from doch da on creek july 9 the male in the female plumage a dull colored male from doch da on creek july 22 these were identified as pinicola enu cleator flammula by dr h c oberholser of the united states biological survey carpodacus purpureus purpureus gmelin eastern purple finch we had collected during most of the month of june in the vicinity of telegraph creek without once encountering this species then on july 5 in a section we had previously worked most thoroughly about a mile from telegraph creek we encountered several small flocks of purple finches three were taken nos 39872 39874 a male and two females all birds that apparently were just through breeding the male is in the streaked female plumage with just one pink feather on the breast both females show some reddish on the rump these birds are unequivocally of the subspecies purpureus and their capture at this point constitutes i believe a material extension of range northwestward the species probably breeds somewhere within a few miles of where the birds were collected loxia curvirostra bendirei ridgway bendire crossbill during the latter part of june a few red crossbills were seen flying overhead in the vicinity of telegraph creek on june 22 a small flock was encountered apparently a single family and four birds were collected nos 39876 39879 an adult male and three juvenals it is of interest to note that these birds are of the subspecies bendirei widely different in appearance from the form inhabiting the nearby coastal region of alaska this would indicate that the range of the small sized red crossbill of the pacific slope of british columbia and1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 233 southeastern alaska is entirely cut off from that of loxia curvirostra minor of eastern north america through the interven jm of the form bendirei the alaskan bird has been named loxia curvirostra sitkensis by grinnell 19096 p 223 based largely on color characters in the adult male birds from vancouver island do not exhibit the same sort of differentiation from minor in fact to my eye they are indistinguishable nevertheless it seems evident that the vancouver island birds also occupy part of the territory that is separated from minor by the habitat of bendirei the proper nomenelatural treatment of such a form as the vancouver island race of loxia curvirostra is an open question it seems evident that genetically it is as far from minor as is bendirei yet since the birds from the pacific and atlantic regions are indistinguishable in appearance we call them all by the same name the characters ascribed to l c bendirei by ridgway 1901 p 50 are as follows similar to l c minor but decidedly larger adult male averaging rather lighter or brighter in color the adult female slightly lighter and grayer these characters are well borne out by the specimens of bendirei in the collection of this museum in addition the young birds from telegraph creek all in the streaked juvenal plumage exhibit well defined features of size and color they are appreciably larger than comparable examples of sitkensis and minor and are grayish toned juvenals of the small coastal race are much more greenish and olivaceous in general body color iii li i loxia curvirostra sitkensis grinnell sitka crossbill on sergief island during august and september a few red crossbills were seen at various times on august 28 an adult female was collected no 39875 this bird was evidently incubating a set of eggs judging from the bare breast and the condition of the oviduct it seems curious that nesting should have been going on at that season when we had taken full grown juvenals of bendirei at telegraph creek in june li i in loxia leucoptera gmelin white winged crossbill first positively identified at glenora july 4 and near telegraph creek july 5 though small flocks had been seen several days before that were suspected to be this species during the first three weeks in july flocks were seen daily in rapidly increasing numbers then 234 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 m m h l 111 at doch da on creek july 21 a male bird was shot that was one of a pair several pairs were seen there subsequently and the flocks appeared to be breaking up at flood glacier july 26 to august 8 the species was present in great numbers and breeding no nests were discovered but several females were shot that had laid parts of their sets the birds were fairly numerous at great glacier august 9 to 16 several were seen about the custom house at the boundary august 16 and they were frequently observed at sergief island up to the time of our departure it was a surprise to me to find this crossbill nesting so late in the summer that this is not the invariable custom of the species is shown by grinnell s 1900 p 45 account of their habits in the kotzebue sound region where eggs were found in may their actions in the stikine country may have been influenced by food conditions for in 1919 throughout the region there was a tremendous crop of spruce cones which were ripening at the time of the appearance of these birds at glenora the crossbills were feeding on the seed pods of the cottonwoods as they were also in some degree at doch da on creek but farther down the river and a little later in the season the spruce cones had their undivided attention the song of the white winged crossbill was one of the most notable features of the bird life of the stikine valley as the flocks broke up the male birds sang more and more during our stay at flood glacier they were at the height of their efforts and the music was in our ears at all times it was a continuous rollicking trilling song lasting for minutes at a time without cessation and loud enough to be heard several hundred yards the singer was usually on some high perch preferably the dead top of a tall spruce frequently he would fling himself into the air on wide extended slow beating wings singing as he went flying sixty or seventy yards perhaps to another perch the song is somewhat suggestive of that of a caged canary we also found it reminiscent of that of the california house finch carpodacus mexi canus frontalis the song flight especially is suggestive of a similar spring performance of the house finch nine specimens collected nos 39880 39888 four adult males and five adult females two from glenora two from doch da on creek and five from flood glacier 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 235 leucosticte tephrocotis littoralis baird hepburn rosy finch met with at but one locality on the mountain tops above doch da on creek we made two trips to the higher ridges above timber line and saw rosy finches in some numbers each time they appeared in view soon after we emerged from the upper edge of the forest about 3500 feet and they evidently inhabited all of the open country from there on upward upon our first visit to their territory july 11 not many of the birds were seen and they were mostly drifting about through the air by twos and threes as horned larks do at times the next time we climbed the mountain on july 23 we found them in much greater numbers just at the upper edge of the timber a flock of twenty or thirty was encountered feeding in tall dry grass that had grown up in an area previously swept by fire many dead trees stood on this slope and the rosy finches when startled flew to the tree tops this entire flock was of adult birds two males were collected and my impression was that they were all males beginning to flock together after the nesting season a little farther on females and young were found mostly near extensive snow banks the young were all in juvenal plumage and were not quite full grown that is wing and tail feathers had not reached their full length the old birds were assiduously feeding the young and in the pursuit of this duty we several times saw them fly into the air to capture flying insects which were then carried to the waiting offspring twenty one specimens collected all taken july 23 nos 39889 39909 four adult males seven adult females six juvenal males three juvenal females and one juvenal with sex not ascertained the adults are all in worn breeding plumage though the feathers are not so ragged as might be expected some are just beginning the annual molt the main plumage variation concerns the gray coloration on chin and throat in some the brown of the breast extends well up on the chin in others there are scattered gray feathers extending downward from the throat on to the breast the juvenals as compared with the similar stage in leucosticte tephrocotis dawsoni from the sierras of california are noticeably dark colored throughout the gullets and stomachs were preserved of sixteen birds all that contained any food from these it is evident that insects form a large part of the diet of both old

creek birds were seen carrying building material during the first week of june and on june 20 a set of three eggs was taken the extensive open fields at glenora were thickly grown up with dandelions when we arrived there at the end of june and the siskins were present in large flocks feeding upon the dandelion seeds at the same place they were seen about the log cabins picking at the plaster between the logs at doch da on creek at flood glacier and at great glacier siskins were encountered daily usually in small flocks during our brief stop at the boundary august 16 the pine siskin was one of the few species of birds noted it was present at sergief island but not numerous the one nest found no 1810 taken near telegraph creek was in a small lodgepole pine in very open woods the same tract where the bohemian waxwings were nesting it was about six feet from the ground resting against the main stem and well nigh hidden by the clusters of needles upon the small supporting branches the structure is well built and compact composed outwardly of small twigs and the white down from the fireweed the lining of grasses and some moss from the trees the outside diameter of the nest is about 90 millimeters depth about 60 inside diameter about 60 inside depth 25 millimeters the eggs three in number were slightly incubated they are a little paler than lichen green in two cases there is a wreath of reddish1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 239 spots at the large end in the third egg this wreath is reduced to a few minute spots seven specimens of this bird were collected all adults nos 39910 39916 four are from the vicinity of telegraph creek one from glenora one from doch da on creek and one from flood glacier these birds are grayer in general coloration than most of the specimens in a comparable series from the alaskan coast but there are individuals in the coastal series not to be distinguished from those taken in the interior calcarius lapponicus alascensis ridgway alaska longspur seen only at sergief island where it occurs merely as a migrant first noted on september 3 and the two following days our last in the field small flocks appeared from time to time all the birds seen were flying passing overhead in a southerly direction passerculus sandwichensis savanna wilson savannah sparrow seen only at sergief island upon our arrival there august 17 savannah sparrows were present though not abundant some days later they increased greatly in numbers and at the end of august were found everywhere over the marshes they kept mostly to the flooded grass lands a much wetter habitat than that favored by the song and forbush sparrows also abundant at the same station nine specimens were collected nos 39921 39929 the discovery that the subspecies alaudinus breeds but a short distance inland see p 240 was an incentive toward an accurate determination of the status of the quite distinct coastal subspecies this coastal subspecies formerly lumped with passerculus s alaudinus has been latterly referred to savanna of eastern north america to which it bears a close resemblance see grinnell 19096 p 227 swarth 1911 p 85 there is no doubt however that the form occurring on the coast of southeastern alaska is entirely cut off from the habitat of the eastern savanna by the intervention of the range of alaudinus it is a local race that is probably confined almost entirely to the alaskan coast and with but a limited migration one extending usually not much farther southward than the puget sound region there is apparently no place where it approaches at all closely the habitat of the eastern savanna a thousand miles or more must intervene nevertheless despite the wide difference in habitat birds from the two regions are so much alike in appearance that i am unable to detect any character whereby they hie240 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 can be distinguished it is a puzzle just what should be the proper nomenclatural treatment of these forms in all probability the relationships of the two are not particularly close it seems likely that there is continuous distribution of savannah sparrows along the pacific coast of north america with probable intergradation between the alaska forms and the darker colored california subspecies and this i believe is the line of closest affinities i am willing to admit geographical distribution as one of the characters of a form but to make distribution the sole character is farther than i care to go so on the ground of external resemblance the savannah sparrow of the coast of southeastern alaska is here recorded as p s savanna but with no belief that it is genetically the same as the eastern subspecies bearing that name the case is closely paralleled by the red crossbills loxia curvirostra sitkensis and l c minor passerculus sandwichensis alaudinus bonaparte western savannah sparrow found at but one or two points in the upper stikine valley on may 31 at the junction the mangled remains of one were found in a mousetrap our first intimation of the arrival of the species several were seen at the summit june 4 a male bird collected at that time appeared to be breeding at glenora there were a few scattered through the weed grown fields and they were evidently nesting there the males were uttering their wheezy trills from the tops of low bushes or from fences or stakes and could be found at about the same spots day after day females collected were evidently incubating no savannah sparrows were seen farther down the river than glenora until we teaehed the coast the habitat of another subspecies there are not many places in the telegraph creek region that afford the needed surroundings for this bird for extensive clearings supplying the open ground they favor are found in but few places where we saw them at the summit is at about the upper limit of timber and it may be that the species occurs commonly in such a habitat we saw no savannah sparrows however on the mountain top above doch da on creek four specimens collected nos 39917 39920 two adult males and two adult females these are obviously different from p s savanna of the coastal region compared with the latter the telegraph creek birds are of grayer coloration have a longer wing and a more slender19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 241 bill they are apparently the same as the form occurring in the uplands of west central and southern california in winter to which the name passerculus s alaudinus has been applied see palmer 1918 p 123 zonotrichia leucophrys gambeli nuttall gambel sparrow fairly common in the river valley at telegraph creek this may be taken as near the western limit of the summer habitat of this subspecies in this region for although the birds were numerous in and about the town of telegraph creek they became notably scarce a very few miles farther down the river in our two weeks collecting at glenora but one bird was seen and none was observed farther down stream with the exception of one at sergief island after the fall migration had begun several nests were found near telegraph creek on june 6 a bird was seen carrying building material on june 11 and 14 three nests were discovered on certain slopes near sawmill lake where most of the timber had been removed they were much alike in site and construction placed on or near the ground under the piles of brush left from the trees that had been cut away each contained newly hatched young three and four in number the parent bird when frightened by our near approach did not fly direct from the nest but skulked through the brush for ten or twelve yards before flying two specimens collected an adult male at telegraph creek no 39930 and an immature female no 39931 taken at sergief island september 4 the only one seen at that point zonotrichia coronata pallas golden crowned sparrow the closely related golden crowned and gambel sparrows occupied different local habitats although both occurred commonly in the same general region presumably telegraph creek is near the eastern limit of the habitat of coronata just as it is at the western confines of the summer home of gambeli their segregation apparently is due to zonal limitations the golden crowned sparrow is a bird of a higher zone than the gambel sparrow consequently in the stikine region confined to higher altitudes no coronata was seen near the town of telegraph creek altitude 540 feet where gambeli was common but on the trail to the summit twelve miles north of town and at about 2700 feet altitude they appeared in some numbers where the timber iff ii iff mi fir n til a 1242 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 i mill became dwarfed and scattered the birds were in full song during the first week in june a female shot june 5 contained eggs just beginning to form as we went down stream the species was seen nowhere in the bottom lands but it was encountered once more on the mountains above doch da on creek there we found the birds at timber line on july 11 and again on july 23 dixon found them amid similar surroundings on a mountain a few miles north of doch da on creek kirk s mountain on july 16 and saw two bobtailed young at these several points they were at the extreme upper limit of timber at about 3000 to 4000 feet altitude and mostly in dense thickets of prostrate mountain balsam abies lasiocarpa from these shelters could be heard a sharp far reaching chip a note that was difficult to locate but was finally traced to the golden crowned sparrow the birds were undoubtedly nesting in the balsam thickets probably they had young at the time but careful search failed to reveal any except the two that dixon saw while stalking a mountain goat on july 23 the birds were noticeably fewer in numbers than they had been on our first visit to their habitat on july 11 and it seemed probable that they had already begun to leave it seems likely that the timber line habitat of coronata extends westward nearly or quite to the alaskan coast with field glasses we were able to see at various points down the stikine ridges and mountain tops that appeared to be much like the high altitudes we reached from the upper river near the coast however the mountains are in most places extremely hard to ascend and the fauna of their summits is as yet unknown the golden crowned sparrow is a species of high hudsonian and alpine arctic it is a bird of the coastal region rather than of the interior but except at the northern end of its habitat is apparently restricted to high altitudes during the summer months during the migrations this sparrow is abundant at sea level at sergief island the first one appeared on september 1 the next day the species was present in considerable numbers seven specimens collected nos 39932 39938 three at the summit june 4 and 5 one on the mountain above doch da on creek july 23 and three

frequently singing from some low perch two nests were found here on june 19 and 24 each was in a lodgepole pine sapling some ten feet from the ground and in each case the tree was too slender to be climbed the species was likewise abundant at glenora and at doch da on creek it was not seen farther down the river seven specimens collected all adults nos 39942 39948 these and others from northern

stikine region is a matter of more than ordinary interest to both the taxonomist and the student of geographic distribution and evolution any treatment accorded this form would doubtless arouse criticism from some direction but it seems to me desirable that the race be accorded formal subspecific status this junco is in my opinion a good subspecies a geographic race in the sense that the birds over a certain area of undetermined extent but undoubtedly a considerable stretch of country exhibit a combination of characters distinguishing them from other described forms and they remain true to these peculiarities within as close limits as do most recognized subspecies bii iii 1244 university of california publications in zoology you 24 till ir jii llifll tiw i the outstanding characteristics of the cassiar junco are as follows most nearly related to junco hyemalis hyemalis males of the two subspecies are very closely similar differing in minor particulars as detailed beyond the average female of junco h connectens is quite unlike female hyemalis it has ordinarily more or less pink on the sides and brown on the back the head is of a darker color and is sharply cut off from the brownish back above and from the pink sides and white belly below the general appearance of the female is like that of the female junco oreganus shufeldti from which it differs in having usually less brown on the back and less pink on the sides now as regards the name to be used for this form my first impression was that here was an undescribed subspecies a new race that required a new name it was evident however that this was a migratory form and that individuals must have been collected in their more southern winter home even though the summer habitat had not heretofore been explored there was at least a chance that a winter taken specimen had served as the basis of a description at some time a search through junco synonymy disclosed one name that seemed to require investigation junco hiemalis connectens coues 1884 p 378 which has been applied in various ways two specimens the one upon which this name was based together with another like it females collected at colorado springs colorado april 26 and 27 were described in some detail by allen and brewster 1883 p 189 under the name junco hiemalis oregonus they are there considered as intermediates between hiemalis and oregonus ridgway 1901 p 276 lists coues connectens as a probable hybrid under the heading junco hyemalis x junco oreganus shufeldti in a footnote loc cit he makes the following comment this type specimen which i have carefully examined and compared is no 7046 of mr brewster s collection and was taken by mr brewster at colorado springs april 26 1882 it is very nearly typical of j hyemalis with sides only slightly tinged with cinnamomeous and the back slightly brownish it may be a young female of the preceding year of hyemalis at any rate it has nothing to do with the form of oreganus j o shufeldti to which the name connectens was unadvisedly applied by action of the a o tj committee in 1896 dwight 1918 p 289 remarks as follows this is perhaps an appropriate place to discuss briefly and to dispose of the junco hyemalis connectens of coues the original description 1884 key north amer birds 2d ed p 378 is a curious mixture of fact and fancy but fortunately the type is extant in the collection of mr wm brewster no 7046 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 245 april 26 1882 colorado springs colo i have examined it and as correctly stated by mr ridgway 1901 birds north and middle amer pt 1 p 276 footnote it is clearly a specimen of hyemalis and shows the characters common to sex and season the american ornithologists union committee 1897 p 128 1910 p 266 follows coues 1897 p 94 in applying the name connectens to the form named junco hyemalis shufeldti by coale 1887 p 330 and re named as i believe junco oregonus couesi by dwight 1918 p 291 it is thus seen that the two men ridgway and dwight who have most carefully studied the genus junco in recent years unite in the belief that connectens is not a recognizable form it is after some hesitation that i offer a contrary opinion but i believe that the new material at my disposal justifies my view as to the treatment of the name connectens by the a 0 u committee i am of the same opinion as ridgway that it is wrongly applied in the check list to the form that should be called junco oreganus shufeldti coale the description by allen and brewster 1883 p 189 of the colorado bird that served later as the type of connectens obviously a migrant or winter visitant at the point of capture fitted so nearly my specimens from the stikine region as to lead me to suspect them to be the same this bird as part of the brewster collection is now in the collection of the museum of comparative zoology at cambridge i have not examined it myself but at the kind suggestion of mr outram bangs i sent him a selected series of the stikine birds for comparison with the type of connectens and incidentally with any other pertinent material he remarks upon them as follows i have compared the skins most carefully with our very large series of eastern birds the very black sharply marked off top of the head in your male birds i cannot match the type of j connectens coues is a female taken at colorado springs colorado apr 26 1882 it is a counterpart of your no 10945 mus vert zool no 39957 indeed you would have difficulty in telling the two apart except that the type of connectens is although taken at an earlier date in a little more worn plumage i can t find spring females from the east just like these but on the other hand autumnal females much resembling them probably young birds of the year are common in our series for comparison with hyemalis the form to which i believe connectens is most nearly related i have had an abundance of non breeding birds from various places in the eastern united states and a few from western points no series of breeding birds of the eastern junco h hyemalis is available i 1 ilii 246 university of california publications in zoology yol 24 i ijbfe the adult male of connectens is very similar to hyemalis at first glance in the field there was no doubt in my mind that hyemalis was the form encountered comparison with eastern birds however shows certain appreciable differences connectens is darker colored throughout and compared with the more uniformly slaty hued hyemalis is seen to possess a blackish head quite sharply defined at a line above the shoulders beneath in connectens the outline of the black breast is convex against the white belly forming a sharp angle where it joins the gray sides in eastern hyemalis the slaty breast and sides usually form a concave outline against the white belly in most cases a specimen of connectens viewed laterally is seen to possess a black head pattern above and below just about as in junco oreganus though of course more obscurely indicated than in that species these distinctions as just detailed would not amount to very much in a single bird perhaps but viewed in mass effect with specimens of the three forms arranged in parallel rows the differences are readily noticeable the black headed appearance of the male is a feature that is conspicuous in the live bird the female of connectens is as a rule more nearly like the female of a subspecies of the black headed junco oreganus group than like female hyemalis the sides are more or less tinged with pink often quite strongly so and the back with brownish the blackish head is sharply defined against the back and against the pink sides and white belly two among the fifteen females from telegraph creek and glenora have no pink on the sides though with brown on the back these two birds are most nearly like hyemalis of the others it is safe to say that not one would be ascribed to hyemalis if taken in its winter home with nothing but the appearance of the bird as a guide to its specific identity there are certain winter specimens of junco oreganus shufeldti at hand from southern arizona that so far as color and markings are concerned are indistinguishable from some stikine river females arizona specimens of shufeldti however are distinctly longer winged thus there is here a race in which the male bears a strong resemblance to one specific group junco hyemalis and the female to another junco oreganus this race occurring at a point where the boundaries of the two species mentioned come close together different authorities take different views regarding the relationship of the two forms hyemalis and oreganus in the a 0 u check list of north american birds 1910 p 266 they are treated as two subspecies offlfe 1922j swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 247 one species ridgway 1901 pp 278 283 regards them as specifically distinct each divided into several subspecies dwight 1918 pp 285 291 also considers them as two species dwight however regards as of hybrid origin several forms of junco that are accorded subspecific or even specific rank by ridgway and others all confusing plumages found in the borderlands where different species of junco come together he regards as the result of hybridism in view of these different opinions it is of interest to secure specimens and study conditions at places where two distinctly characterized forms meet the upper stikine valley is such a place and with these points in mind the junco of that region received special attention in our field work though anticipating some interesting discoveries in the distribution of the forms involved it could hardly be foreseen that this borderland should be occupied by a race so curiously combining the characters of the eastern hyemalis and the western oreganus with the ascertaining of this fact there now remains the proper application of it and in this i fancy there will be difference of opinion first is the occurrence of birds of this description in a sense intermediate between hyemalis and oreganus to be taken as indicative of intergradation between the two are hyemalis and oreganus therefore to be regarded as two subspecies of the same species i think not there is no adult specimen in the connectens series that could for a moment be confused with the coastal junco junco oreganus oreganus the subspecies geographically most closely adjacent to the upper stikine race there are no doubtful specimens as between these two forms hence no intergradation the measurements of connectens do not show intergradation between junco h hyemalis and junco o oreganus see table p 254 the resemblance of the female connectens is toward junco o shufeldti junco h connectens of the a 0 u check list a pale colored form of junco oreganus occurring to the southward there may be intergradation between connectens and shufeldti farther south in british columbia but as yet we do not know that to be the case then as to the theory of hybridizing used to a great extent in comparable cases by dwight in his study of the juncos 1918 such a decision in the present case as in certain others so disposed of by dwight seems to me to distort the meaning of the word hybrid out of all recognition and to apply it to facts and conditions it is not commonly called upon to cover i am willing to admit that a name such as junco annectens baird may have been applied to an individual bird s 5s p pi i fi i l j 1 v 248 university of california publications in zoology you 24 1 i fll slil lll iphilii ma j li 1 r v il 111 actually of hybrid parentage in the usually accepted sense in that particular case with one parent junco caniceps the other junco mearnsi and i am willing to admit see postea that individual hybrids may occasionally occur between any species of junco whose ranges adjoin to consider as hybrids however all the birds juncos in this instance of a whole region despite the facts that they comprise the only representative of the species in that region that they all exhibit the same combination of characters over a wide stretch of country and that they breed true that is transmit these same characters to their young is an utterly misleading use of the term the junco of the stikine river should not be regarded as a hybrid as bearing upon the fact that it is the female of connectens that shows variation from the hyemalis type attention may be drawn to the following statement by dwight loc cit p 289 the variation in females of the three species i e hyemalis oreganus and mearnsi complicates the question still more for the average females of the three differ much less from one another than do the males and the hybrids between them would seem therefore to be much more numerous i suppose the application of this to the present case the junco of the stikine region would lead to the conclusion that here on a large scale is an example of sex linked inheritance that in the hybridization of hyemalis and oreganus the female offspring only show the oreganus characters that such is not the case is shown by specimens collected at flood glacier described farther on where the race here designated connectens comes into actual contact with oreganus my own conclusions are as follows the junco of the stikine region is a recognizable form apparently the same to which coues applied the name junco hiemalis connectens it is most nearly related to junco hyemalis hyemalis and may be conceded to exhibit intergradation of a sort as between junco hyemalis and junco oreganus that is the peculiarities of this subspecies undoubtedly have some bearing upon the relationship of those two aggregations of races the intergradation exhibited however is apparently as between the two species junco hyemalis nd junco oreganus rather than between two adjacent subspecies junco hyemalis connectens and junco oreganus oreganus it is not of the sort that is usually found between two subspecies of the same species and for the present it may well be disregarded as a sub specific criterion it seems to me that this is a proper place for a somewhat arbitrary division and that junco hyemalis and junco oreganus should still be regarded as separate specific groups then 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 249 as previously shown the junco of the stikine region although in a sense intermediate in appearance between hyemalis and oreganus can not properly be considered as an aggregation of hybrid individuals the only alternative left therefore is to consider this form as a distinguishable geographical race of the species it most nearly resembles and apply a separate name as i have done as we descended the stikine leaving the habitat of connectens behind and drawing nearer to that of oreganus every effort was made to secure juncos at telegraph creek and glenora juncos connectens were abundant at doch da on creek though in lessened numbers they were still fairly numerous and all still of the same subspecies our next stop was at flood glacier some forty miles down stream and about seventy miles from the coast there we were in a region where either coast or inland species might occur and the junco was one of several birds that we searched for especially at that point juncos were not numerous however and our two weeks of collecting there yielded but fifteen specimens of these eight are adults six males and two females the two females are junco o oreganus beyond a doubt of the male birds one no 39999 is typical connectens it is in extremely worn plumage but is evidently of exactly the same character as telegraph creek specimens one bird no 39993 while not an average connectens it shows some rusty on the back can be matched by one variant taken at telegraph creek another no 39998 is somewhat more reddish on the back though the sides are slaty the remaining three adult males nos 39987 39988 39990 if taken farther south in their winter home would undoubtedly be considered as examples of junco oreganus shufeldti they are shorter winged than arizona winter specimens of shufeldti but they have the black head a glossier black above than in connectens brownish back and pink sides of that race however despite their general appearance i cannot believe that these birds are shufeldti i do not believe it possible for the habitat of that subspecies to extend northward as a tongue inserted between the ranges of connectens and oreganus juncos can not be distributed uninterruptedly from the southward over the glacier covered mountains that constitute so large a part of this intermediate region their distribution must lie in narrow ribbons along the river valleys extending from the interior to the coast such as the stikine and the affinities of birds taken at any one point in these valleys must lie with others immediately adjacent above and below therefore despite the superficial resemblance of these250 university of california publications in zoology yojj 24 flood glacier juncos to shufeldti i decline to consider them as of that subspecies or to call them by that name this despite dr dwight s belief that we must name a bird by the plumage it is wearing not by the one that it ought to be wearing because it has been captured within the bounds assigned to another geographical race 1918 p 294 flood glacier is close to the point where the change in the character of the country takes place between the humid coast and the arid interior it is the uppermost point on the river reached by certain coastal species of birds very few indeed go any farther inland not many inland species extend farther down the river we took here specimens of typical connectens and of oreganus besides these intermediates forty miles up stream nothing but connectens was seen thirty miles farther down the river at great glacier nothing but typical oreganus in view of these facts it seems to me that these few specimens of indeterminate character taken practically on the boundary line between the habitats of the two forms may be regarded as veritable hybrids between the two they are certainly not indicative of intergradation as it usually appears between closely related subspecies the seven juvenals from flood glacier naturally offer difficulties in their allocation such as are not encountered in adults young of connectens taken early in the season in the upper stikine valley compared with the corresponding stage of oreganus from the coast present certain obvious differences as the juvenal feathers become faded and abraded however these distinctions are much less apparent and the young birds from flood glacier had worn the juvenal plumage to the molting time those that do show specific peculiarities all lean toward oreganus and one or two otherwise indeterminable were taken in company with an adult female oreganus there are available but very few breeding specimens of slate colored junco from alaskan points these specimens on the whole look more like eastern hyemalis than like stikine river connectens the only breeding females one from cordova bay and one from rapids yukon river are quite unlike any females in the stikine series i have had for examination a series of seventeen adult juncos eight males and nine females from the collection of the provincial museum victoria british columbia taken at atlin during june and july 1914 atlin is at the northern boundary of british columbia about one hundred and fifty miles north of telegraph creek for the1922 swarth birds andjdammals of the stikine region 251 most part these birds are essentially like the stikine specimens one male prov mus no 3683 is much paler colored than the others more of the slaty gray of eastern hyemalis a variation that may be indicative of intergradation with hyemalis in alaska a little to the northward one female of the lot prov mus no 3698 wilson creek atlin b c june 29 1914 is so very different in appearance from the rest of the series as to suggest its belonging to another species it is appreciably larger than the others actually so in length of wing and tail and to all appearances in bulk also as well as can be judged from prepared skins it is faintly brownish on the back and with a suggestion of pink on the sides this bird may perhaps be an example of montanus which has been recorded as occurring at alaskan points not very far distant altogether the scanty material from alaska together with the british columbian series points to the restriction of the race connectens to a region mostly south of alaska and probably almost entirely in british columbia in this connection attention should be drawn to a record by bishop 1900a p 86 of the occurrence of junco hyemalis connectens shufeldt junco at white pass city and glacier alaska a record that may perhaps pertain to connectens as here regarded osgood 19096 p 41 records junco hyemalis montanus from points on the upper yukon an adult female having vinaceous sides and pronounced of this form by mr ridgway was collected by hollister at circle july 7 also a specimen collected by myself near charlie creek in 1899 appears to be of this form when we arrived at telegraph creek may 23 juncos were abundant and in pairs evidently nesting was well under way the male birds at that time were fond of perching on some elevated position a telegraph pole or a house in town a dead tree top out in the woods where over and over again they gave utterance to a brief monotonous trill hardly long enough or loud enough to merit being termed a song the first nest was found on june 4 about midway between telegraph creek and the summit a region in which there was still much snow this nest was placed in an overhung crevice in the dirt wall bordering the trail and was discovered through the brooding bird s sudden departure it contained four eggs with incubation just begun see fig z from then on nests were found at intervals up to july 5 on that date two were discovered at glenora one with four fresh eggs one with four young about five days old 1 252 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 all nests discovered were on the ground but in a variety of situations some were in the shelter of a bank or stump others on open level ground with little or no concealment five nests with sets of eggs were preserved nos 1811 1815 four sets of four eggs each one of five the nests are all much alike in structure rather flimsily built mainly of rather fine dry grass or weed stems with occasionally some shreds of bark or coarser twigs or straws on the outside and with finer grass or hair for lining fig z nest of the cassiar junco junco hyemalis connectens placed under a fallen tree at the side of a trail photograph taken near the junction june 6 1919 the first young out of the nest was taken on june 14 hardly able to fly shortly after young birds began to appear in considerable numbers up to the third week in july they were still in the streaked plumage throughout the post juvenal molt had not yet begun shortly after that time we left the territory of this subspecies so that no specimens in autumnal plumage were collected this junco is mainly a bird of the valleys mostly in rather open woods a few were seen well up in the mountains not in the dense spruce forests of the middle heights but at the upper edge of the timber where the trees were more scattered and of smaller size this was at about 4000 feet elevation the male junco was sometimes seen making a display of his plumage the tail was widely spread so as to expose the white outer feathers about the only sharply contrasting feature of the junco sks 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 253 plumage this was done not on the ground but up in the shrubbery the tail was held stiffly spread and pointed straight downward while the bird hopped from branch to branch about the female young birds just out of the nest were several times found infested with parasitic larvae the first bird in this condition was collected near telegraph creek june 15 on picking it up after shooting it a maggot dropped to the ground and i noticed then a bare spot on the bird s head with a small hole where the larva had been attached upon skinning it two more larvae were found between the skin and skull surrounded by a mass of yellow serum later on other young juncos were taken similarly afflicted with the larvae always on the top of the head the larvae were white in color seven millimeters long and about three in diameter junco oreganus oreganus j k townsend oregon junco twenty seven specimens referable to this subspecies were collected at three different points as follows

indicated in the young young oreganus is a ruddy appearing bird young connectens grayish while these differences are apparent in fresh plumage they are not so obvious when the feathers become worn the young birds from flood glacier at about the dividing line between the ranges of oreganus and connectens are ready to discard the juvenal plumage and in some specimens it is not possible to tell to which species they belong however those which do show specific peculiarities are apparently oreganus two young males beginning the post juvenal molt are acquiring pink sides and in one of them the new feathers on the head are distinctly blacker than in connectens young females undeterminable in appearance were taken in company with an adult female oreganus for these several reasons i have assigned

may perhaps be of intermediate character like some of the flood glacier birds previously described but it is in the midst of the annual molt and the duller red of the back may be an appearance that is largely due to this cause the six specimens from sergief island in fully acquired first winter plumage are all typical oreganus neither at flood glacier nor great glacier were juncos abundant and it was only by the closest search that specimens were obtained when we arrived at sergief island august 17 there were no juncos to be seen anywhere on august 23 two were obtained the first noted and a day or two later they became fairly numerous 11 melospiza melodia rufina bonaparte rusty song sparrow song sparrows are rare in the upper stikine valley or rather the species occurs in relatively few place s we found some birds around sawmill lake and about marshy spots near telegraph creek and a few in similar surroundings between that town and glenora a female collected at sawmill lake on june 9 contained an egg that would have been laid in a day or two a young bird just out of the nest was taken on june 18 near doch da on creek and a mile or two back from the stikine there were certain marshy meadows where song sparrows were really abundant bordering the grassy areas were sloughs grown with reeds and surrounded by willows here the song sparrows had evidently been nesting and at the time of our visit july 8 to 26 were apparently engaged with their second broods full grown young were more abundant than adults and by the middle of july we found these young birds spreading out farther and farther away from the central swamps and down toward the river the old birds remained closely within the more restricted meadows where we first found them and those collected had every appearance of being engaged in nesting these adults were extremely shy at all times and specimens were obtained with difficulty at flood glacier there were a few song sparrows seen mostly in patches of fireweed near the river all taken were juvenals apparently wandering from the nesting ground as we had found them at doeh da on creek we found no place near flood glacier offering suitable li 256 university of california publications in zoology you 24 breeding grounds for song sparrows none of the birds was seen at great glacier but one was noted near the custom house just above the boundary august 16 at sergief island song sparrows were abundant they were mostly at the upper edge of the marsh land just below the coniferous forest where a bordering strip of dense underbrush alder willow devil s club and other shrubbery afforded shelter to many birds of similar habits the song sparrows ventured some distance out onto the marshes but always along narrow tidal channels where tall grass overhanging the sloughs made arched passageways beneath which the birds found concealment when need arose a large proportion of those seen at sergief island were young birds and young and old were mostly in various stages of molt a young male taken august 18 is in first winter plumage throughout most of the young birds seen at that time were still in juvenal plumage one taken as late as september 1 had not yet begun the molt from that stage two adults shot august 18 and 22 respectively had not yet begun to molt another taken on september 1 had almost completed the change forty four specimens were collected nos 40020 40044 40047 40065 as follows telegraph creek three adult males two adult females one juvenal female doch da on creek three adult males ten juvenals flood glacier four juvenals sergief island two adult males one adult female five immature males first winter plumage thirteen juvenals i had anticipated that the song sparrow of telegraph creek would prove to be different from the coast bird and that it would probably be melospiza m inexpectata as a specimen ascribed to that race was recorded from telegraph creek by riley 1911 p 234 in his description of the subspecies i am however unable to distinguish any points of difference between birds from the upper stikine valley and those from the coast they seem to me to be all referable to ruflna upon first consideration it seems strange that in two regions with such diverse faunas in general as is the case in the upper stikine and the coast regions the song sparrow usually so variable should be one of the few birds to remain the same in both places this is by no means inexplicable however upon consideration of some of the factors involved the species melospiza melodia extends much farther north along the coast than it does inland there is no subspecies of the interior that ranges nearly as far north as does ruflna of the coast 19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine reg ion 257 it follows that any song sparrow colony of an interior point closely adjacent to the coast such as the telegraph creek region must have been derived from the coast region song sparrows in other sections are known to be influenced in their distribution by extent of riparian surroundings suited to their needs they will follow a favorable water course through otherwise unsuitable surroundings less regardful of faunal or zonal limitations than of the associations of plants and water it therefore seems apparent that the occurrence of the song sparrow at the headwaters of the stikine river represents an outpost of ruflna an overflow of birds that have penetrated to that point by ascending the river from the coast not part of another race that is of general distribution throughout the interior melospiza m inexpectata may be a recognizable race in the region of the type locality moose lake british columbia in southeastern british columbia and southwestern alberta cf oberholser 1918a p 187 but the song sparrow of northwestern british columbia is unmistakably ruflna apparently the song sparrows of the inland regions are not completely enough isolated from the parent stock or have not been for a sufficient length of time to produce distinguishable differences as to the length of time that they have been there we have no means of knowing as to the completeness of isolation in the upper stikine valley my impression derived from the season s observations is that there is practically continuous distribution of song sparrows along the river breeding colonies are doubtless scattered and perhaps at rather wide intervals but apparently migrating birds occur at any point there is an interesting point involved in the migration of the song sparrows at the upper end of the stikine valley do these birds travel north and south to the eastward of the coast range as is the case with so many other species of that region or do they follow the stikine to and from the coast our own observations shed no light upon this question it can hardly be solved save by some person who is permanently residing in the country in this connection it may be noted that brooks 1912 p 253 definitely cites the subspecies ruflna as the form occurring at okana gan british columbia where the fauna otherwise is mostly of the interior also taverner 1919 p 84 records ruflna as the song sparrow at hazelton in the interior of british columbia some two hundred miles south of telegraph creek i have seen some of taverner s hazelton specimens and agree with him in his determination 258 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 lill i 11 in pill the bird collection of this museum contains sixty three specimens of ruflna from the islands and mainland of southeastern alaska representing many island localities and several points on the mainland the largest series from any one place is that from sergief island the alaskan series as a whole displays considerable variation in color in general size and in size and shape of bill whether these differences can be correlated with different habitats island and mainland or whether they are merely differences between individual specimens cannot be settled with the material at hand there are too few breeding birds from any one place the variation is considerable and it includes breeding birds that are just like the telegraph creek specimens for the present at least the whole aggregation had best be left under the name ruflna there is one kind of departure from the normal ruflna that is comprehensible and that is a variation illustrated in many individuals tending toward caurina the subspecies breeding just north of the habitat of ruflna this trend is especially noticeable among the birds collected upon sergief island in august and september birds which i believe were mostly migrants from the north typical ruflna and caurina are widely different in appearance in size color and shape of bill but there are specimens at hand forming almost every link in a chain connecting one extreme with the other the same individual however does not necessarily exhibit the same intermediate condition in all

island august 17 to september 7 it was evident that there was more or less migratory movement of song sparrows the numbers present fluctuated from day to day in a way that could not otherwise be explained typical examples of caurina were taken from time to time as noted elsewhere in this report which 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 259 of course were migrants and the assumption is that those individuals of intermediate character that were taken at the same time were also migrating birds presumably from some intermediate region near the northern limit of the habitat of ruflna our experience on the upper stikine leads me to believe that very young birds even before the juvenal plumage is discarded may wander many miles from the nesting ground melospiza melodia caurina ridgway yakutat song sparrow a fairly common migrant at sergief island amid the same surroundings as ruflna one was seen the day of our arrival august 17 and the birds were present in fluctuating numbers up to the date of our departure september 7 the third week of august was the time of greatest abundance usually caurina and ruflna could be told apart in life the greater size and grayer color of the former serving to distinguish it ordinarily there are of course equivocal specimens as mentioned in this report under ruflna that are practically intermediate between the two subspecies and difficult of determination even when in hand there are also in the series of caurina from sergief island some specimens closely approaching the larger kenaiensis in appearance as however the latter reach only the minimum measurements of that subspecies it seems best to place them all under caurina there is thus in the available series of caurina a considerable range of variation exemplified from small reddish colored birds not widely different from ruflna to large gray colored ones that could be inserted in a series of kenaiensis without violence there is one bird from sergief island no 40045 female august 18 that i refer to caurina despite the fact that it is largely in juvenal plumage and was collected in the breeding range of ruflna such of the first winter plumage as has been acquired is distinctly of the caurma type and in the flesh the bulk of this bird was decidedly greater than that of the average ruflna despite the youth of this individual i believe it to be a migrant from the distant habitat of caurina juvenals of ruflna also were found traveling far from the nesting ground fourteen specimens of melospiza m caurina were taken at sergief island on dates ranging from august 18 to september 5 nos 40045 40046 40066 40077 the series comprises one adult male one adult female five immature males six immature females and the juvenal female above described 260 university of california publications in zoo logy vol 24 melosp iza lincolni gracilis kittlitz forbush sparrow probably occurs throughout th i upper stii ine valle y but judging from our experience in small numbers and at widely scattered points a female shot june 9 at sawmill lake had laid part of its set of eggs just one other bird was seen at that locality the species was next encountered at doch da on creek where one pair perhaps more had nested in the tall grass of a meadow a young bird caught in a mousetrap at flood glacier was the only one seen at that station at sergief island the species was abundant many of the birds wercthere when we arrived on august 18 and they greatly increased in numbers within the next few days at the upper margin of the marshes that section which is but rarely inundated by the tides there is much willow brush increasing in density and size of the trees as the salt water is left behind the lower edge of this strip where the willow brush was about waist high and rather scattered and with thick grass beneath was the preferred habitat of the forbush sparrow and here the birds literally swarmed i was accustomed to think of this species as being rather solitary in its habits but here whether or not the birds were in constantly associated flocks their choice of surroundings brought hundreds of them closely together in traveling through the willow brush one flushed them from every thicket on august 22 i stopped to count those that hopped up into the branches of one small bush preparatory to taking flight at my approach and there were fifteen in sight at once the species was still present at the end of our stay september 7 but much fewer in number fifteen specimens were collected an adult female and an adult male from sawmill lake nos 40078 40079 two adult females and two juvenals male and female from doch da on creek nos 40080 40083 one juvenal male from flood glacier no 40084 and eight specimens from sergief island two adult females five immature males and one immature female nos 40085 40092 the young birds from sergief island have all completed or nearly completed the post juvenal molt an adult female taken august 18 is in the midst of the annual molt the tail feathers are all gone and the wings so nearly bereft of flight feathers that the bird could scarcely fly the second adult female taken august 22 has finished the molt the specimens from the upper stikine valley are to my eye indistinguishable from the coast birds and i therefore consider them all of the subspecies gracilis there is no question of the distinctness of1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 261 this northern race from the paler colored and more narrowly streaked form breeding in the high mountains of california which is regarded as lincolni but just what relation either of these races bears toward typical melospiza lincolni lincolni from eastern north america i do not know i have no material available from any eastern points for the use of the name melospiza lincolni gracilis kittlitz rather than m 1 striata brewster as in the a 0 u check list see oberholser 1906 p 42 if v 1

is a migrant through this region and it is probably of rare occurrence passerella iliaea fuliginosa ridgway sooty fox sparrow among the most interesting of the season s discoveries were those relating to the manner of occurrence of passerella in the region explored our first experiences were disappointing i had confidently expected to find some form of this species in the telegraph creek region either p i iliaea or p i altivagans but failed to do so it does not follow of course that one or the other of these birds does not occur locally somewhere in that general region but if so i believe it will be found on the higher mountain slopes i do not believe we could have overlooked the species had it been present in the lower valley fox sparrows were first encountered at doch da on creek on july 17 an adult male was obtained first heard singing from its perch near the top of a small willow a young bird was taken near by the same day both were in brushy bottom land near a slough a tangle of willows growing amid nettles tall grass and other shrubbery not at all the kind of place that fox sparrows might be supposed to inhabit later on at flood glacier and again at great glacier fox sparrows of the same subspecies were shot at various times the birds were far from abundant and it was only through the most assiduous search that specimens were obtained they inhabited the densest in 11 1 in 262 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 brush where they remained out of sight for the most part and there were neither songs nor call notes to draw attention to their presence at sergief island one specimen referable to this subspecies was taken on august 27 in all fourteen specimens were collected nos 40093 40106 as follows doch da on creek one adult male one juvenal male flood glacier one adult female one juvenal male two juvenal females one juvenal sex undetermined great glacier one adult male two adult females two juvenal males one male in first winter plumage sergief island one male in first winter plumage the adults are all in worn breeding plumage or just beginning the annual molt of the young birds some are in juvenal plumage throughout some are partly through the post juvenal molt and two from great glacier august 10 and sergief island august 27 respectively are in first winter plumage throughout i had supposed that the form of fox sparrow that would be found inhabiting the mainland coast of this part of alaska would necessarily be p i townsendi which is known to occur much farther south on certain of the islands our stikine birds however unquestionably are not townsendi for the present at least they must be considered as fuliginosa in my revision of the avian genus passerella 1920 p 149 i have described a series of fox sparrows winter visitants taken mostly in the vicinity of berkeley california that i have referred to fuliginosa although they are not typical of that form the statement there made is that these birds are too unlike summer examples of fuliginosa from washington and vancouver island to come from that region and that they must be migrants from some other section it was intensely interesting to discover that the stikine river summer birds exactly matched the winter birds described from california as between alaskan examples of townsendi and the stikine river fuliginosa we have in both series for comparison adults in similarly worn breeding plumage also young in juvenal plumage molting into first winter plumage and in first winter plumage throughout the color differences are apparent in every stage the discovery of fuliginosa in this part of alaska and british columbia discloses certain departures from the distribution of that subspecies and of townsendi as given by me in the revision above cited swarth 1920 pp 144 149 map fig n fuliginosa evidently occurs from puget sound northward to the stikine river but north of vancouver island probably on the mainland only or perhaps on islands close to the british1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 263 columbia coast townsendi occurs southward on various islands off the coast of southeastern alaska and on the queen charlotte islands british columbia its occurrence in summer on the mainland of southeastern alaska is questionable i know of no breeding records from that region on the map above cited there is a cross indicating an occurrence at helm bay south of the stikine river but the bird upon which that record is based was an august specimen and may have traveled some distance i myself in 1909 collected many specimens of townsendi at port snettisham and the taku river alaska north of the stikine river and under circumstances that make it seem likely that those were breeding stations but no nests were actually found in field work of that same year at boca de quadra the chickamin river and bradfield canal on the mainland south of the stikine river and at thomas bay a short distance north of the stikine no fox sparrows were seen see swarth 1911 p 93 there is a record of the occurrence of townsendi in june on wrangell island near the mouth of the stikine river swarth 1920 p 146 the facts now indicate that the summer distribution of fuuginosa is from extreme northwestern washington and vancouver island northward on the mainland only at least to the stikine river on the latter stream it extends inland about a hundred miles following the course of the river its extension inland elsewhere is unknown to me in fact i know of no records of fuuginosa from any mainland station between the two extremes of its range puget sound and the stikine river there is another point to be considered namely the possibility of subspecific difference between fuuginosa of the puget sound region and the bird i have called fuliginosa from the stikine river sufficient difference that is to be worthy of recognition in nomenclature this is a contingency that may have to be met in the future in another connection i have pointed out in some detail differences that appear to exist between the two lots swarth 1920 pp 149 150 briefly the series comprised of the stikine river specimens and the winter birds from berkeley differ from certain vancouver island specimens and from the type specimen of fuliginosa in being of a duller tone of brown in having the lower tail coverts less tawny and in the more stubby bill the differences are real as far as the series go and appear to be fairly constant the difficulty lies in the few specimens available of typical fnmginosa under the circumstances further subspecific division does not at present seem desirable 264 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 lill f llll m fall specimens of townsendi from port snettisham and the taku river are notably dark colored as compared with summer specimens of the same subspecies from the adjacent islands while this may be due in some degree to seasonal differences of plumage it may also be indicative of intergradation toward fuuginosa at those points piranga ludoviciana wilson western tanager a few seen in the vicinity of telegraph creek and glenora not more than seven or eight individuals in all the first noted a male was encountered near telegraph creek on june 18 a nest was found at four mile creek between telegraph creek and glenora in an alder in the rather dense vegetation that bordered the stream about twenty five feet from the ground and four feet from the main trunk the female was seen on the nest july 5 two specimens of the western tanager were preserved

at telegraph creek the only place where we saw the species nests old and new were placed on several houses in the town one specimen collected an adult female on june 23 no 40111 this specimen is of notably large size as compared with breeding birds from california and from illinois presumably it belongs to the northern subspecies that oberholser 1919c p 95 has named petrochelidon albifrons

telegraph creek the species was already there at the time of our arrival may 23 and the birds were occupied with nest building nests were seen only on1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 265 buildings and the birds themselves rarely strayed far outside the town one nest noted which was placed upon a telephone insulator on the government agent s office must have been used for some years for it was built up to a height of six inches or more flocks of migrating swallows that were seen in august at several points down the river were apparently of this species but could not be satisfactorily identified these flocks were invariably traveling up stream in the harbor at wrangell august 16 were large numbers of barn swallows mostly young flying about and alighting on the shipping and wharves on sergief island during the next two weeks the species was seen frequently traveling southward in large flocks the flocks diminished in numbers toward the end of the month the last bird observed was a single individual on august 30 two specimens of the barn swallow were preserved an adult male and an adult female both taken at telegraph creek on june 11 nos 40112 40113 iridoprocne bicolor vieillot tree swallow just one pair seen at sawmill lake near telegraph creek they were nesting in an old woodpecker hole in a dead birch stub at the margin of the lake a pair of

swallow abundant about telegraph creek nesting in crevices in the buildings and in a cliff overlooking the town from the northeast the birds were settled in their nesting sites when we arrived may 23 but individuals collected on june 8 had not yet laid their sets the species was fairly abundant at glenora at doch da on creek the latter part of july violet green swallows were seen frequently at sergief island toward the end of august the species was encountered on so many occasions that it seems probable that it is of regular occurrence as a migrant at some points at least on the coast of southeastern alaska despite the paucity of records as far as i know my own observations on the chickamin river and at thomas iii 266 university of california publications in zoology you 24 ijllfi lilt bay are the only ones from the region that pertain to this species see swarth 1911 p 96 at sergief island small flocks were seen passing over the marshes in migration usually in company with barn swallows upon various dates ranging from august 20 to september 2 on august 28 a flock of a hundred or more circled about over our camp for several hours last noted on september 2 when a single bird was taken the only one observed it is a question whether the individuals seen migrating at this point were travelers from points to the northward or whether they had followed the stikine river from the interior i am inclined toward the first alternative for in our own leisurely descent of the river we had seen no indication of any such migration of these swallows five specimens preserved two adult females from telegraph creek one adult male from glenora and two juvenal males from sergief island nos 40116 40120 vm ii ii riparia riparia linnaeus bank swallow a few seen at glenora hovering

reichenow bohemian waxwing found in the lowlands bordering the stikine river from telegraph creek down stream as far as doch da on creek there was no obvious reason why the species should not extend still farther down the river save that a few miles below this point those changes first begin to be apparent in the general character of the region that culminate in the thickly forested and humid conditions prevalent on the coast food conditions appeared ideal for berries of various species eaten freely by other birds occur in abundance throughout this region if it is solely the question of food that governs the erratic wanderings of the waxwing as is so frequently contended in connection with its appearance in winter farther south it would seem that the species should have been noted by us along the entire length of the stikine it seems evident however that there must be some barrier more subtle19221 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 267 than that formed by the abundance or scarcity of food plants that keeps the waxwing closely restricted to the upper part of the stikine valley similarly restriction to the lower altitudes near the river is probably significant of zonal limitation we saw no waxwings at high elevations until july 23 when a flock of about twenty birds was encountered at timber line about 4000 feet on the mountain above doch da on creek during our first two weeks of field work at the junction the species was not once observed presumably the slightly greater elevation at that point was enough of a barrier to keep the waxwing in the warmer section by the river when we moved from the junction to telegraph creek the birds were encountered at once and they were found in some numbers thereafter at various nearby points a wood road following the creek from which the town derives its name turns abruptly aside some half a mile up stream ascends the steep embankment on the west and thus reaches a terrace that extends for several miles here waxwings were seen upon our first visit to the place and it was later found to be a favorite resort on the morning of june 9 i had my first glimpse of the birds my attention was attracted by the call note and a moment later a flock of a dozen or more swung past and disappeared over the tree tops later in the day others were seen at almost the same place two together at two different points during the next ten days waxwings were seen continually in the same general locality sometimes two together mated pairs we supposed at the time sometimes in small flocks we shot a few but mostly we watched them and followed the pairs about hoping but scarcely expecting that they would lead us to a nest the actions of these birds were extremely puzzling for they seemed quite carefree and many were in flocks when we did obtain both birds of a pair they proved to be two males finally it began to dawn upon us that the waxwings were coming daily to a favorite feeding ground nothing more when disturbed they always disappeared in the same direction over some low hills to the westward and our search was pursued in accordance with this suggestion with satisfactory results the terrace or plateau above mentioned of which so far we had merely skirted the eastern edge extends westward a mile or more is quite level and but sparsely covered with forest growth a year or more before our visit it had been swept by fire and a large part of the268 university of california publications in zoology vol timber destroyed as we saw the place there was very little underbrush of any sort a great many dead trees mostly pines with some poplars and a scattering growth of live trees that had escaped destruction the conifers were the lodgepole pine pinus contorta and were all small trees on june 19 we first saw evidence of nesting activities though as we afterward learned the birds must have been busy for some time on this occasion a pair of birds flew past each with nest material in its bill and disappeared in a clump of little pines a short distance away a short search discovered the nest just well started in one of the pines some six feet from the ground and quite conspicuous to the view a second nest was found a short distance away at a point where there had been an indian wickiup occupied by a solitary old witchdoctor several days before this habitation had been destroyed by fire and some of the surrounding trees including the one with the nest somewhat scorched apparently the fire smoke and noise had been too much for the parent waxwings and they deserted the nest which contained five newly hatched young the young were pretty well dried up when found on june 22 the third nest was discovered two birds were seen in flight toward a pine a hundred yards or so distant one the male presumably lit in the top of the tree the other disappeared in the foliage below almost instantly the male flew high in the air joined two others that were passing by and all three went off together toward the slopes where we had previously found so many of the birds feeding an inspection of the pine disclosed the waxwing s nest the tree was only about twenty five feet high with straggly branches and little foliage the nest rested upon limbs and against the trunk about fifteen feet from the ground it contained six eggs almost ready to hatch during the next few days several other nests were found a record

patch of woods this tract was composed mainly of balsam firs of rather large size with an admixture of cottonwoods and poplars and with but little underbrush while these woods were thus fairly open they were still much denser than those in which we found the waxwings nesting at telegraph creek the two occupied nests were less than a hundred yards apart were exactly alike in location and structure and when found each contained one fresh egg each was near the top of a fir about twenty five feet from the ground supported upon a branch and by surrounding twigs and close to the trunk on july 15 one of these nests was taken together with a set of three eggs the other contained two eggs and was left undisturbed no more eggs were laid in this nest the female being still incubating the

an outer structure of dead twigs lending support to a mass of black moss and white plant fiber dry grass was used as a lining sometimes but not always the black moss was the one material that was used in the greatest amount and it appears in all but one of the nests this moss grows abundantly on the conifers of the region depending from the branches in great masses like coarse hair the white plant

ground and was built on a side branch of a small spruce that was growing at the outer edge of a clump of thick spruces on low ground the nest was large the base being made of small dry spruce twigs internally it was constructed of fine grass and moose hair and lined thickly with large feathers in 1901 brooks discovered the waxwing breeding at 158 mile house in the southwestern corner of the cariboo district british columbia i first noticed them there on 11th june when i came across a small flock and shot one which proved pn dissection to be a female about to lay on returning to the same spot i found the waxwings consisting of a colony of five pairs of birds still there and soon discovered a nest in a murray pine near the end of a limb and about twenty five feet up this then 12th june contained two eggs on the 15th i took this set which then consisted of four eggs the nest was loose and bulky composed of usnea moss dry grass and weed stems and lined with fine material with a few green aspen leaves in the lining no doubt to render the eggs less conspicuous on the 26th june i carefully jooked over all the trees in the neighborhood with my binocular and found three more nests all in tall douglas fir trees two of these i was able to climb to each contained four eggs within a few days of hatching the nests were similar to the first but without the green aspen leaves probably jhie to the fact that the nests were better concealed from above brooks 1903 p 283 11 on june 10 1908 r m anderson found the species nesting near fort smith at the boundary between alberta and mackenzie in nearly all respects the circumstances were as we found them on the stikine soon i saw what appeared to be a nest a moss covered bunch near the top of a straight slender jack pine pinus banksiana about 45 feet fromthe ground the nest however was so artfully concealed and draped with mosses that i could not be sure that it really was a nest until i actually peered over the edge of it

2 inside depth outside 3 inches inside 1 inches composed externally of small short dead pine twigs loosely arranged and partially covered with pale green moss and small bunches of white cottony vegetable fibres the nest lining consisted of a few fine grasses a few bunches of fine wooly black mos3 and bunches of the soft white cotton the tree containing the nest was at least twenty feet from any other tree and had no limbs for at least twenty feet from the ground the nest was placed close to the body of the tree and supported by two small nearly horizontal limbs and a few lateral

these few records covering six localities in the canadian northwest and alaska appear to be the only authenticated instances of the actual taking of nests and eggs of the waxwing in north america in addition may be cited riley s statement 1912 p 69 of the probable nesting of the species at moose in southeastern british columbia though he found no nests the conditions under which he found the birds were sufficient proof of their breeding the nesting of the european subspecies bombycilia garrula gar rula was most carefully described by john wolley 1857 in his memorable account of the first discovery of the nest and eggs of the bohemian waxwing in finland and by newton 1861 in a longer paper describing the same material wolley s description of the nest reads in part as follows the main substance of the nest is of the kind of lichen commonly called tree hair this main substance of the nest is strengthened below by a platform of dead twigs and higher up towards the interior by a greater or less amount of flowering stalks of grass and occasionally pieces of equisetum he also found a little reindeer lichen green moss willow cotton and fiber of grass leaves in the structure sometimes one or two feathers in the lining the nests were built on the branch of a tree not near the bole and rather standing up from the branch than supported by twigs touching it at the sides of six nests four were in small spruces one in a good sized scotch fir and one in a birch all placed at a height of from 6 to 12 feet above the ground the nest seems generally much exposed in parts of the forest considerably open five seems to be the ordinary number of eggs in one nest only there were as many as six in the backward and cold spring of 1856 waxwings had their full complement of eggs

small and occurring over nearly the entire egg though less numerously at the smaller end than elsewhere there are also obscure underlying spots of bluish but faintly seen the fourth set no 1821 is more olivaceous the ground color close to ridgway s mineral gray the spots are fewer in number than in the other sets larger and more sharply defined as to plumage the more conspicuous variable features in the wax wing s markings are the waxlike tips to the secondaries the white and the yellow markings on primaries primary coverts and secondaries and the yellow tips to the rectrices the most elaborate study yet made of the plumage of this species is that written by henry stevenson 1882 based upon 144 specimens killed in england during the winter of 1866 67 many of his statements are of interest in connection with the series of waxwings now in the collection of this museum first as regards the wax secondary tip he gives the following table including those birds of which the sex had been ascertained by dissection males 3 had 4 tips 7 had 5 tips 14 had 6 tips 14 had 7 tips 3 had 8 tips 41 females 1 had 2 tips 4 had 3 tips 7 had 4 tips 6 had 5 tips 7 had 6 tips 2 had 7 tips 1 had 8 tips 28 sex uncertain 1922 2 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 277 a similar table of 38 specimens of the american subspecies in this museum of which the sex has been ascertained is as follows males 2 have 3 tips 6 have 4 tips 5 have 5 tips 8 have 6 tips 1 has 7 tips 22 females has no tips has traces of have 3 tips have 4 tips have 5 tips 7 have 6 tips 1 has 7 tips tips 16 besides those thus tabulated there are certain other variants one male has a faint trace of a wax tip on a secondary on one side only one female has two on one side three on the other one female has four on one side two on the other one female has five on one side six on the other stevenson seemed to believe that such irregularities were due to accidents or wear but in these birds there is no evidence to show that the unadorned secondaries had received any injury one female is indicated in the table as having traces of two tips they are so faint that they can be seen only by the most careful scrutiny and are devoid of red color of all the adult specimens examined forty five in number just one was found a female with absolutely no trace of the wax tips in several cases these tips show a decided tendency to split up like feather barbs it thus appears that these appendages are formed by the coalescing of barbs and not by an enlargement of the tip of the central shaft though the shaft too is involved in the general change the ornamentation in fact may well have begun with the coloring of the shaft spreading later over the adjoining feather barbs the last stage would have been the coalescing of the barbs forming the waxlike scale as it is now seen various steps of this hypothetical evolutionary development are supplied in the wing and tail feathers of different birds of this series the primaries of the waxwing have a white or yellow marking near the tip this marking is sometimes confined to the outer web and sometimes continued on to the inner web the latter producing a v shaped marking has been designated by stevenson loc cit as the return margin in the brightest colored birds these markings are bright yellow on the inner primaries becoming more and more white on the outermost ones in the duller colored birds they are white throughout the v shaped character is invariably accompanied by m278 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 ii lilt 1 ii mm mm bright yellow outer margins but the yellow color is not restricted to the individuals that have this return margin some of the birds with the primary markings absolutely confined to the outer feather margins still have them of brilliant yellow none of the birds with white primary spots have the return margin there are several birds of both sexes at hand with more or less indication of red at the tips of the tail feathers this is never at all conspicuous and is usually confined to the shaft of the feather at the extreme tip in one or two instances the color spreads out over the adjoining vane but without any coalescing of the red colored barbs not one bird in the series has any well defined wax tips to the tail feathers similar to those on the secondaries there is some variation in the yellow tip to the tail feathers both in intensity of yellow and in the breadth of the marking there are also some specimens with one or more tail feathers longer or shorter than the rest and of a different tone of yellow giving the appearance of having been held over from a previous plumage stevenson loc cit after careful study of the extensive series of birds at his disposal was unable to discover any external character distinguishing male from female though he was inclined to believe that the assumption of the yellow tinge on the primary markings is probably more gradual in the female than in the male the series before the present writer does not shed any additional light upon this question although there is considerable variation in the character of wing and tail markings it appears to be purely individual it so happens that the brightest colored bird of the lot is a female mus vert zool no 17437 sexed by c i clay in size but not in number of wax wing tips in return margins of primaries in yellow on primaries and in size of white spots on secondaries it is superior to any of the males in this bird the wax secondary tips are 7 mm in length a size attained by only one or two males the brood of young birds we collected was naturally of more than ordinary interest the nest was discovered on june 24 containing five young not more than two or three days old on july 5 we returned the nest was in a slender tree that swayed under the least pressure and at the first disturbance the young birds fluttered to the ground the brood was about two weeks old at this time in two or three days more at most all would have left the nest voluntarily the brood consisted of four males and one female 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 279 these young waxwings presented a most striking appearance in life for to my surprise they exhibited all the characteristic markings of the adult not only that but the yellow tip to the tail was much brighter more of an orange yellow than it is in any of the old birds the wax tips to the secondaries were present in each of the four males but not in the female two of the birds had four such tips one had five and one had seven as many as are seen in any of the adults these wax tips are as large as in many old birds as rectrices and remiges were but partly grown out the brightly colored tips occupied a much greater proportion of the whole than is the case in fully feathered birds the resulting color effect was most bizarre the young with their remarkably vivid markings looked utterly unlike the soberly colored adults the four young males are very much alike in color and markings the only differences in appearance being those arising from the slight difference in stage of development the marginal primary markings are present sharply defined and in each case bright yellow in many adults these markings are white in the young males the terminal tail band is orange buff the primary tips light orange yellow in the brightest adult at hand the tail band is light cadmium the primary tips lemon chrome in the young female the tail band is somewhat paler than in the males though still more orange than in any adult the primary tips are but slightly tinged with yellow a still more remarkable feature in the young males is the fact that in each one the rectrices are distinctly tipped with red these red tips are not fully developed sealing waxlike scales such as are on the secondaries but are produced by red coloration of the terminal portion 4 or 5 mm in length of the feather shaft of the rectrix the female parent of this brood the only one of the pair collected is a highly plumaged bird it has six secondaries of one wing five of the other with wax tips the primary margins are bright yellow the tail is broadly tipped with yellow and there is a faint suggestion of red in one or two of the tail feathers as regards the young birds it is seen that they possess all the peculiar markings of the most brightly colored adults except the j return margin upon the primaries this is not seen in any of the young the yellow wing and tail markings are much brighter than in any adult at hand even than in freshly molted birds with these feathers but partly grown while the young birds possess all the markings of the adults they are appreciably different in general body color they it i280 university of california publications in zoology vol ft i rij 4 19 pf i tilt it have a somewhat streaked appearance though not as much so as in the young cedar waxwing the whole body is of a duller darker gray than in the adult and the young bird has none of the vinous coloring about the head that is seen in the adult the crest is present but only slightly developed the young has a dull black line from the nostril to the eye and posteriorly on the head in resemblance to that on the adult but in our specimens of young there is just an indication of the black throat this may be due to the fact that in these birds the feathers of chin and upper throat are but partly developed but appearances would indicate that in the fully acquired juvenal plumage the throat is whitish bordered on each side by a line of dull black the middle of the belly is whitish the under tail coverts a paler and duller chestnut than in the adult one feature in which the young waxwings differ notably from the adults is the color of the inside of the mouth this was a bright reddish spinel pink of ridgway with a short sharply defined streak of mathews purple on each side at the corner of the mouth in adults the inside of the mouth is flesh color with but a suggestion of bluish at either side on the roof of the mouth in the young birds the iris is dark in adults there is a narrow but distinct red ring surrounding the black pupil although the fact that the young bohemian waxwing possesses practically all the distinctive markings of the most highly developed adult was a surprise to the writer when the birds were first encountered in the field it is not new in ornithological literature there have been a few juvenals collected but although their appearance has been commented upon at the time of capture apparently the compilers of the more general handbooks have never cited these scanty specimens as representative of the usual condition casual mention of an early streaked stage similar to that of the cedar bird is the information usually given wolley s description of a young bird in his account of the first discovery of the nesting of the european subspecies is as follows a young bird caught on the 5th of august as it fluttered from the nest had a general resemblance to the adult though all the colours were more dull the wax like ends to the wing feathers the yellow tip to the tail the black patch between the eye and the beak are all there whilst the rich mahogany of the under tail coverts is of a quieter brown the blooming vinous colour of the head and back has not yet emerged from a homely neutral and the crest is but just indicated by the longish feathers of the crown the most marked difference between the adult and young is in the throat and under surface generally there is at present scarcely a trace of the deep black patch of the chin and the delicate tint of the general under surface of the adult is replaced by mottled1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 281 neutral and white this upon examination is found to owe its appearance to those longer webs which arising towards the root of each feather extend as far outwards as the webs which arise nearer its tip being very pale or white and thus relieving on both sides the last mentioned darker webs wolley 1857 p 56 in gould s birds of great britain there is a colored plate figuring adult birds a nest and five young of the young three show the back and wings all with wax tips to the secondaries these figures are from young taken by dresser july 4 1858 but although five juveniles are figured in the text the statement is made that four young were in the nest and just two were caught gould 1873 vol i pi 21 bishop 1900a p 89 describes three fully fledged young from the yukon region as having the waxlike appendages to the secondaries but of a paler red than in the adult one of these same young birds is described in detail by ridgway 1904 p 106 evidently but few young birds of this species have been collected judging from those that have been taken the waxlike secondary tips occur as frequently in the juvenal plumage as in the later stages in fact with respect to all the variable features in this species wax tips white or yellow wing markings and yellow tail band it is not possible to detect any correlation between the extent of these markings or the intensity of their color and either age sex or season we have as described birds in juvenal plumage as brightly marked as any adult the fact that in the brood of five collected the four males have the wax tipping and the one female lacks these appendages gives the appearance of this being a sexual feature to offset this the female parent of this brood had the wax tips fully developed then the female parent of a set of five eggs taken the same day has the wax tips almost entirely lacking in commenting upon the bohemian waxwing as a winter visitant to montana where they were abundant cameron 1908 p 46 says only a small proportion had yellow primary bands in the great majority these were white most birds had no red sealing wax appendages visible and were presumably the young of the year others besides showing white edging to the ends of all the primaries except the two first had four wax tips on the secondaries these may have been birds of eighteen months old which had moulted twice having regard to the fact that the waxwing moults only once a year in october a few of the birds had brilliant yellow wing bars and numerous vermilion appendages and i concluded that this small minority were old birds 1 w 1 w 11 282 university of california publications in zoology you 24 irlli liiil similar lines of reasoning have been followed regarding other birds than the waxwing that is different types of plumage have been taken as indicating different ages rather than descriptions of plumages being based upon specimens whose ages had been definitely ascertained in other ways there is probably hardly a species where it would seem a more obvious or safer thing to do than to judge the age of a waxwing from the number and size of the waxen wing tips yet inspection of the juvenal plumage shows how unsafe such assumptions may be the most surprising statement in cameron s account is the assertion that most birds had no red sealing wax appendages visible of the forty five adults examined in the present connection only one lacks any trace of such an appendage and except for cameron s comment i should have believed that it was unusual for a bohemian waxwing to lack these ornaments in the smaller cedar waxwing the case is different an examination of the latter species as represented in this museum discloses 36 specimens with more or less wax tips to the secondaries and 41 without a vestige of such marking judging from the material at hand therefore this character seems to be much more fully developed in bombycilla garrula than in b cedrorum the flocking instinct is strong in the waxwing at all times the nests we found at two different localities while not sufficiently close together to merit the term rookeries were gathered in close proximity and to the exclusion of surrounding areas apparently just as well adapted to the purpose the birds obviously prefer to nest in fairly close company when a sitting bird left the nest for the short time necessary to feed each day it was to join one or two others and do the foraging in company while both birds of a mated pair work at nest construction apparently all the labor of incubation falls upon the female her mate thrown upon his own resources usually joined some other unoccupied male usually two males fed together occasionally there were more in company flocks were noted all through the breeding season usually of not more than twelve or fifteen individuals by the end of july gatherings were seen that were several times as large in nest building male and female worked together dixon ms observed one pair at their labors for some time and made the following notes after the observer had taken his station the female arrived with some white plant fiber she put this fiber in place and then sitting in the nest she turned around and around shaping thus with her breast the nest cavity then the male arrived with more of the plant1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 283 fiber he placed it within reach of the female who proceeded to weave it into the structure the birds worked so assiduously that the nest was nearly finished by noon of the second day after it was begun in approaching and leaving the birds were usually together instead of flying directly to the nest they generally lit in some nearby trees then approached unobtrusively by several short flights through the thicket in departing similar precautions were used when perching they almost invariably chose a tree top or some elevated and projecting limb this was especially noticeable in birds disturbed at their nests and it was also the manner in which they perched when engaged in flycatching activities different birds varied in the degrees of tameness they showed about the nests the female of the first set taken remained upon the eggs until the collector s hand was within a few inches of her male and female together hovered about for a few minutes occasionally uttering the usual call note and raising and lowering the crest then they left and did not return at all in the two hours that we remained in the vicinity a sitting bird when closely approached invariably pointed the bill almost straight up and kept the crest closely pressed to the head the young birds frightened from the nest resorted to the same tactics on one occasion one of a pair of waxwings presumably the male was seen strutting about and exhibiting his beauties to his mate considering that the two sexes are alike in every respect it seemed rather a superfluous performance but at any rate the one bird was hopping excitedly about from branch to branch while the other sat still and looked on the active performer kept the tail partly spread wings drooping and crest raised and the whole body was held stiffly upright after several minutes the other seemed to tire of the performance and flew away followed at once by its mate waxwings were seen feeding on insects and also on berries and other vegetable matter about telegraph creek the first week in june they were usually seen perched on bare branches and making short sallies after flying insects in true flycatcher style early in july a berry bearing shrub shepherdia canadensis of general distribution in the region came into bearing and the waxwings as well as other species of birds fed upon the berries of this plant to a great extent the young waxwings we took from the nest had also been fed upon these same berries under ordinary circumstances the only sound uttered by the waxwing is a sibilant call note much like that of the more familiar cedar 1 hi284 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 111 lljlli bird while notes of the two species are of the same character still they are distinguishably different this difference may perhaps be indicated by describing the cedar bird s call as a hiss the bohemian waxwing s call as a buzz the note of the latter is somewhat coarser the listener has an impression of hearing a series of very slightly separated notes rather than of a continuous sound such as the cedar bird utters the call note has been commented upon by cameron 1908 p 47 who says when flying the birds keep up an incessant twittering so that high passing flocks are immediately recognized by their call of zir r r r a sort of trill griseom and harper 1915 p 369 make the following comments upon the waxwing s call though similar in general form to the beady notes of b cedrorum they are less shrill are more leisurely uttered and have a more noticeable rolling sound they are also more distinct there being a comparatively greater interval between each syllable in the series the call has been represented by seebohm as cir ir ir ir re quoted in sharpe s hand book to the birds of great britain vol i p 177 and by cameron as zir r r r but neither rendering seems to express exactly the decided sibilant quality of each syllable e m anderson 19156 p 146 makes a rather surprising statement regarding the voice of the waxwing while on the wing the birds uttered a short succession of high pitched screaming notes closely resembling in character though not in volume the cries heard on nearing a pigeon guillemot rookery on the seacoast as far as i am aware this is the only published statement that ascribes to the waxwing any note other than the well known hissing sound a bird shot by the present writer which fell to the ground wounded uttered a loud chattering noise the only time i ever heard anything of the kind the young birds we removed from the nest called a great deal one of the five fluttered off into the bushes where he escaped observation but he soon began calling and was thus discovered according to dixon s notes at the time the call note of the young waxwing was much like that of a young california shrike the american waxwing was given the name bombycilla garrula pallidiceps by reichenow 1908 p 191 with the type locality the shesly river northern british columbia the shesly river a tributary of the inklin which in turn empties into the taku has its source some twenty five miles northwest of telegraph creek its mouth some sixty miles beyond thus for all practical purposes our telegraph creek specimens of the waxwing may be regarded as topotypes 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 285 i had the opportunity of comparing a selection of these skins with european examples of b g garrula in the united states national museum the color differences distinguishing the two forms were readily apparent in the series thus brought together and the differences appear to me to be sufficiently pronounced to justify the recognition of the american subspecies pallidiceps cf oberholser 1917c p 333 we collected seventeen specimens of the waxwing nine

glacier july 26 the species was present in some abundance at the time of our departure august 8 the birds were nearly all gone whether or not this vireo breeds at the last mentioned locality was not definitely ascertained but i am inclined to think that it does judging from the actions of certain individuals on july 31 a pair of the birds spent nearly the whole day in an alder thicket near our camp scolding continually at some disturber of their peace that i could not discover possibly an owl was roosting near by anyway the vireos acted much as though they were concerned over the safety of their brood at great glacier august 10 two were seen this was the latest date of occurrence and great glacier the westernmost locality at which the species was noted our several points of record apparently constitute the farthest known extension of the range of this subspecies toward the northwest it is not included by anderson 1915a in his list of birds from lake atlin some two hundred miles north of telegraph creek the occurrence at great glacier carries the range to within ten miles of the alaskan boundary and to within about thirty miles of the coast five adult specimens were collected

days earlier the first week in june the birds were abundant and quite generally distributed through the lower valleys the males were especially noticeable from their habit of perching at the tops of dead and leafless trees and there singing the loud song and brilliant color with no concealing verdure round about rendered them as conspicuous as such small birds could well be on june 14 a set of three slightly incubated eggs was taken no 1822 the nest was in a cottonwood sapling some twelve feet from the ground at the edge of a dense thicket at doch da on creek the latter part of july yellow

been present farther up the river eighteen specimens of yellow warbler were collected at points on the stikine river nos 40156 40173 the series comprises six adult males and three adult females from

representation of specimens these opinions were based i do not know my stikine river series is certainly sufficiently different from the coastal bird to forbid the two lots from being considered of the same subspecies the series of rubiginosa in the collection of this museum includes thirteen adult males from vancouver island and southeastern alaska these birds are distinguished in color from other north american races of dendroica aestiva primarily by the combination of dark dorsal coloration paler yellow underparts and narrow and scanty chestnut streaking below the telegraph creek birds do not fit into this category at all in this series the underparts are more brilliantly yellow and the chestnut streaks are in most of the specimens numerous broad and conspicuous as a series the lot fits in absolutely with d aestiva aestiva in regard to ventral coloration in dorsal coloration they average somewhat darker than is the case in an equally extensive series of eastern examples of aestiva though288 university of california publications in zoology you 24 m lllli 1 selections can be made of closely similar specimens in the two series the variation in dorsal coloration is i believe at least partly due to different degrees of wear and fading of the feathers specimens of the two series that were taken at approximately the same dates are practically indistinguishable measurements of the three lots are given below they are of little diagnostic importance in my opinion the stikine river birds should not be classed with rubiginosa they present certain differences in appearance and in habitat and migration they are as sharply set off from the coastal birds as is the case with practically all the other bird species of the region where they were taken on our trip down the river i watched for yellow warblers carefully and purposely and they are rather more conspicuous in migration than most small birds the frequently uttered zip zip as they fly from bush to bush attracts attention and the yellow color is easily seen at doch da on creek at flood glacier and at great glacier yellow warblers were in evidence obviously migrating but below great glacier i could not see that there were any traveling down stream my belief is that they find an outlet through the mountains to the southward and that they do not reach the coast when we reached sergief island in the habitat of the coastal race dendroica aestiva rubiginosa yellow warblers abruptly became scarce we saw very few whereas this island was directly in the line of travel down the river during the first two weeks of our stay the latter part of august none was seen on september 1 several were noted in company with other migrating warblers and on september 2 a single bird was observed on both scores of physical characters and of distribution i regard the yellow warblers of the upper stikine river as best referred to dendroica aestiva aestiva showing some variation toward rubiginosa females and immature birds do not show the subspecific characters as do the adult males and such of the former as were collected at flood glacier and great glacier are ascribed to aestiva on the grounds of

dendroica coronata hooveri mcgregor alaska myrtle warbler apparently not common in this region though some were seen at each collecting station at the junction the species was first seen on may 28 two females taken on may 29 were evidently not breeding from their actions these birds and others seen the same day were as yet not even paired to all appearances they had just arrived none was seen in the immediate vicinity of telegraph creek but a few pairs were encountered at scattered points some miles away a few were seen at glenora at doch da on creek july 8 to 25 small flocks occasionally appeared sometimes a single family sometimes evidently composed of two or more broods the species undoubtedly nests at that point whether or not it nests at flood glacier our next station down stream is questionable though i should think it likely that a few pairs might extend that far several specimens were taken there and others were seen some each day at great glacier august 9 to 16 hoover warblers were seen frequently migrating then and evidently traveling down stream at the time of our arrival at sergief island at the mouth of the river on august 17 there were none of these warblers present the first was obtained there on august 30 and in the next day or two the birds were arriving in considerable numbers we found no nests not many of the birds were seen under such circumstances that it seemed profitable to make search and when we did attempt to watch individuals that were obviously nesting near by the results were fruitless for one thing the suspects we selected invariably dropped all other interests in order to follow us about and each time the warbler we were watching proved able to sit around doing nothing longer than we ourselves cared to the first young bird was collected on june 18 and others in juvenal plumage were taken at later dates to july 10 one taken at doch da on creek july 22 is well advanced in the molt into first winter plumage another from great glacier august 14 has just begun this change one from sergief island september 1 still retains much of the juvenal plumage it is interesting to note that this bird probably traveled some distance from its birthplace while undergoing the molt another specimen taken at sergief island the same day has practically completed the change into first winter plumage adults in various stages of wear were

feathers as yet a male shot august 2 shows the first indication of the postnuptial molt this is evident only in the flight feathers the first primary and the adjoining secondary of each wing being partly grown out no adults were taken at a later date this species is one of the few that migrates coastward at the close of the breeding season there is probably a movement directly southward east of the coast mountains also but there is no doubt but that there is a regular late summer line of travel down the stikine river to the coast the birds were noted traveling down stream and the arrival of the species at sergief island was in sufficient numbers to warrant the movement being regarded as of regular annual occurrence similar conditions have been noted in the late summer at the mouth of the taku river another large stream flowing from the interior to the coast and emptying about one hundred and fifty miles north of the mouth of the stikine river see swarth 1911 p 99 there is no

differences of color and markings that have been said to characterize the two subspecies mcgregor loc cit claimed differences in measurements only bishop 1900a p 90 advanced certain color characters found in a series collected by himself in alaska notably in the summer plumage of the adult male he says adult males average paler below than typical d coronata the black markings being narrower thus giving an effect of broad longitudinal markings rather than black clouding on the chest this statement is endorsed by grinnell 19096 p 235 1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 291 bishop loc cit claims further that there are color differences in the juvenal plumage oberholser 19186 p 465 upholds the validity of hooveri asserting that it differs from dendroica coronata coronata

august 4 and 12 respectively are in first winter plumage throughout although the macgillivray warbler is so abundant in the upper stikine valley that region must be nearly the northern extreme reached by the species it is not included in e m anderson s 1915a list of birds of the atlin district less than two hundred miles to the northward i do not know whether this warbler should be considered primarily as a species of the interior or of the coast or whether it is one of the few birds that occurs in equal abundance in both regions it has been found in summer at various points on the alaskan coast swarth 1911 p 101 19223 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 293 wilsonia pusilla pileolata pallas pileolated warbler in our experience a rare species in the upper stikine valley a few were seen from may 29 to june 1 between telegraph creek and the junction but these appeared to be migrants none seemed to be nesting next encountered at flood glacier where on august 4 a bird was caught in a mouse trap the fall migration was then setting in and a few days later at great glacier pileolated warblers were noted from time to time with other migrating warblers at sergief island the latter part of august they were seen almost daily the last on september 1 six specimens were collected nos 40208 40213 two adult males and one adult female from the vicinity of telegraph creek an immature sex not determined from flood glacier and an immature male and immature female from great glacier these specimens in my opinion are all referable to the subspecies pileolata the three telegraph creek adults are slightly darker and duller colored throughout than coastal birds and to that extent presumably lean toward pusilla but they are not so dark colored as eastern specimens of that subspecies in measurements they do not differ from coastal pileolata with the material at hand it is not possible to tell whether the im matures collected in august at flood glacier and great glacier are migrants from the inferior or from the coast they are not appreciably different from immature pileolata from alaskan coastal points setophaga ruticilla linnaeus american redstart first encountered near telegraph creek on june 11 from the actions of the birds seen on that date and the number that were observed it seemed as though they might have arrived some time previously but the same ground had been traversed two days before without any redstarts being seen or heard from this time on the song of this species was heard by us practically everywhere we went in the poplar woods of the lowlands males in the plumage of the female supposed to be birds of the previous year sang just as did those in the brilliant black and orange livery that the dull feathered males were breeding

plumage the female was almost ready to lay 294 university of california publications in zoology you 24 is at doch da on creek the latter part of july redstarts were present to the same extent as about telegraph creek they were probably still nesting during the third week in july certain birds could be found daily at the same places in the woods and they always evinced concern at the presence of an intruder that we saw no redstarts at flood glacier was probably just chance the species may not breed that far down the river but it undoubtedly occurs as a migrant at least in the fall at great glacier august 8 to 16 the birds were frequently seen and to the last day of our stay this station is about ten miles from the alaska british columbia boundary and the redstarts were sufficiently numerous there to make it seem certain that some individuals must occasionally stray the few miles farther that would take them into alaskan territory i looked carefully for the species on sergief island at the mouth of the river but did not see it there a set of four eggs was taken near glenora july 5 no 1823 on july 2 this nest was found containing two eggs it was placed in an upright crotch in a willow sapling about eight feet from the ground ten specimens of the american redstart were collected nos 40214 40223 three adult males two males breeding but in female plumage one adult female three immature males one immature sex not determined i cannot see that these birds differ in any particular from specimens of setophaga ruticilla from the eastern united states mm anthus rubescens tunstall pipit small flocks that were seen at telegraph creek may 23 and 24 were undoubtedly of migrating birds for the species does not breed in that region at so low an altitude on may 29 a number of pipits were seen at the summit twelve miles north of telegraph creek and at an altitude of about 2700 feet they should have been breeding thereabout for the locality is suitable and birds taken on this date appeared to be in breeding condition but on a later visit to the same place june 4 no pipits were seen next encountered july 11 on the mountains above doch da on creek at 4500 feet altitude and higher where they were fairly abundant and evidently feeding young they were extremely shy and though a good many were seen they were usually drifting about through the air and keeping well out of gun shot they were calling continually uttering a note that i have never heard in the winter this was a sharp oft repeated wheet wheet wheat the notes given1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 295 singly at intervals of several seconds and uttered both in flight and from the ground no nests were found and no young seen when we reached sergief island august 17 the pipits had not yet arrived the first was seen on august 25 then they increased in numbers rapidly and were abundant at the time of our departure september 7 three specimens were collected nos 40224 40226 an adult male

stikine valley on july 23 an adult female no 40227 was taken in a spruce forest on the slope of a mountain above doch da on creek at about 3000 feet altitude this was the only one seen at that point the species was next encountered at flood glacier where a juvenal was collected on august 2 no 40228 at great glacier several were seen and two juvenals collected nos 40229 40230 whether or not the two latter places at the level of the river are breeding stations i cannot say the bird collected upon the mountain above doch da on creek was i believe upon its nesting ground at sergief island the western winter wren was found amid most unusual surroundings in tall grass and reeds far out on the marshes the birds were seen thus daily foraging over the water just as do the marsh wrens sometimes they were in small gatherings five or six at a time being flushed from the grass rh j if j ill 1 certhia familiaris occidentalis ridgway tawny creeper a young male just finishing the molt into first winter plumage was taken at flood glacier august 2 on sergief island august 24 two birds in juvenal plumage were collected these were all that were seen once or twice i thought i heard a creeper s call notes at high altitudes in the mountains but was never able to verify my belief it seems likely that some form of this species breeds throughout the stikine region but if so the birds are certainly present in but small numbers or we would have encountered some the three specimens collected nos 40231 40233 are apparently best referred to certhia f occidentaus though they all exhibit a decided leaning toward c f montana they may all have been migrants from some inland point not far distant inhabited by the subspecies montana s 296 university of california publications in zoology vol

to move about and several more on july 26 an immature male no 40234 was taken at flood glacier august 2 no more were seen penthestes atricapillus septentrionalis harris long tailed chickadee seen at every collecting station east of the british columbia alaska boundary line near telegraph creek the last week in may and the first week in june those seen were quiet and unobtrusive and doubtless there were many more pairs nesting in the general vicinity than appeared to be the case from the few we saw a nest found near telegraph creek contained nine young about ready to leave on june 14 at glenora during the first week in july full grown young were collected from flocks formed by the junction of two sometimes of three families encountered at doch da on creek and certainly nesting there but not so abundant as farther up the river at flood glacier there were a few of the birds about but it seems unlikely that they had nested there we were not at that station at the proper season to definitely ascertain this but the woods are not of the character that is most favored by this chickadee there are no poplars at all the forest is for the most part of conifers with but a few cottonwoods and is dense and dark where the long tailed chickadee appears to be most at home is in rather open and sunny poplar woods several small flocks were seen at great glacier august 9 to 16 but again it does not seem likely that the species had been nesting there the great glacier is only about ten miles from the british columbia alaska boundary so that it is probable that the long tailed chickadee occurs at times quite to the mouth of the river the nest discovered near telegraph creek was in a tract of rather open woods mostly of small poplars it was in a dead poplar stub about three inches in diameter a mere shell of dead and decayed wood hardly strong enough to hold the tightly packed and rapidly growing young who did actually break through the wall at one place the entrance hole was five inches from the base the nest itself flush with the ground the lining appeared to be entirely of matted moose hair both parents carried food to the nest assiduously after foraging expeditions that lasted from two to five minutes in approaching the nest the old birds came through the trees and bushes until within1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 297 about eight or ten feet of their destination then they dropped to the ground and hopped to the entrance to the casual observer they disappeared at a point some distance from the nest and it was not until they had been observed for some time that this subterfuge was detected the staple food that was being brought to the young was a small green caterpillar infesting the poplars at that time also a white grub a green katydid and many mosquito like insects thirty specimens were collected nos 40235 40264 six adults eighteen in juvenal plumage and six in various stages of the molt from juvenal to first winter plumage two of the latter category from great glacier august 12 have nearly finished the change the birds of this series in color and size exhibit the characters ascribed to the subspecies septentrionalis that is as regards differentiation from the eastern atricapillus within the rather extensive habitat of septentrionalis there appears to be some variation in color perhaps enough to separate the stikine river birds as distinguishably darker colored than typical septentrionalis a few specimens at hand from the middle west suggest this possibility but there is not enough material available to verify the supposition the buffy coloration on the sides and flanks appears to be an extremely evanescent character conspicuously present in the fresh fall plumage but absent in breeding adults in which this same plumage has been subject to several months of wear in very young birds nestlings it is strongly apparent but in juvenals that could have been out of the nest no more than a month it has almost entirely vanished h penthestes gambeli abbreviatus grinnell chickadee short tailed mountain the limited opportunities we had for observation of this bird did not suffice to demonstrate its ecological relationships with p atricapillus septentrionalis that is as regards choice of local habitats of the two an interesting point where two such closely related species of one genus occur in the same general region septentrionalis as previously remarked strongly favors the poplar woods and other subspecies of the species atricapillus are known as denizens of deciduous forests elsewhere the species gambeli on the other hand is largely an inhabitant of coniferous woods and it seems likely that in the stikine region p gambeli abbreviatus makes its summer home amid the spruce and balsam of the higher mountain slopes where we never encountered p atricapillus septentrionalis at doch da on298 university of california publications in zoology vol creek at the end of the nesting season small flocks of p gambeli abbreviatus were seen on several occasions it was observed nowhere else five specimens were collected nos 40265 40269 four on july 14 in woods at the river s edge and one on july 23 on a mountain slope at about 3000 feet elevation close to timber line the series consists of two adults in extremely worn plumage and three in juvenal plumage oberholser 19196 p 424 has reported the occurrence of this subspecies at thudade lake british columbia the present point of record is about two hundred miles northwest of thudade lake and in a direct line about sixty miles from the coast it must indicate about the extreme northwestern limit reached by this bird for the use of the name penthestes gambeli abbreviatus see grinnell 1918 p 510 mill penthestes rufescens rufescens j k townsend chestnut backed chickadee a number of small flocks seen in the dense spruce woods at flood glacier the occurrence of this common coastal species at that point implies its continuous distribution along the river below that station that we did not meet with it at great glacier and sergief island was probably fortuitous nine specimens were collected at flood glacier on

to june 4 several of the present species apparently migrants were observed at different times along the trail from telegraph creek to the summit our failure to find the species subsequently may perhaps have been because the birds were breeding in the spruce timber of the higher mountain slopes to which we made but few visits several times i thought i heard the sibilant call note of the golden crowned kinglet in some dense timber above doch da on creek at about 3000 feet altitude in july but i was unable to see the birds at flood glacier august 7 one was seen in a mixed flock of

creek at about 4000 feet altitude presumably upon its nesting ground this bird no 40281 is in very worn plumage but even so there is no doubt that it does not belong to the coastal subspecies r

grinnelli myadestes townsendi audubon townsend solitaire fairly common at low altitudes in the upper stikine valley there were at least three pairs nesting within half a mile of the town of telegraph creek and others were seen down the river as far as doch da on creek the solitaires had already reached the region when we arrived on may 23 in fact nesting activities must have been well under way by that time on june 7 a nest was found containing five eggs just hatching the next morning it held three young birds two of the eggs were apparently not fertile this nest close to town and by the side of a road we traversed almost daily was kept under observation until the family departed on the morning of june 20 the young were gone having left since the previous evening the nest was placed under the overhanging bank on the upper side of a wood road the slope was south facing and the nest well exposed to the sun s rays this exposure advantageous as far as warmth was concerned placed the bulky structure conspicuously in view of anyone passing along the road for there was no concealing vegetation on the bare dirt bank 300 university of california publications in zoology you 24 a second nest in a somewhat similar situation was discovered unfinished on june 8 both birds were around at that time but they deserted this home before any eggs were laid the solitaires did not sing much but the call note was uttered continually from our rooms in town at telegraph creek this was one bird note that could be heard hour after hour monotonously repeated nearly the whole day through to our ears it sounded so nearly like the distant barking of a california ground squirrel citeuus beecheyi that the sound would surely have been disregarded as a bird call had we been in a region where the squirrels

taken near telegraph creek june 9 1919 at glenora early in july and at doch da on creek toward the end of the same month solitaires were seen at intervals single birds and apparently migrating though nearly all that were seen were still in the juvenal plumage while none was observed by us any farther down the river the capture of one at wrangell on april 30 1919 by e p walker no 41286 indicates the possible occurrence of the species at any point in the stikine valley during the migrations two specimens were collected a male and a female both in juvenal plumage taken at glenora on july 5 and 7 respectively nos 40286 40287 compared with calif ornian birds at the same stage the stikine river specimens show some difference in coloration the ground color1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 301 of the upper parts in the northern birds is appreciably more gray less buffy and the spots are less yellowish we obtained no adults but the wrangell adult above mentioned and others from the rocky mountain region farther south are not perceptibly different from the californian birds the differences seen in the juvenals may be significant but our material is not sufficient to demonstrate the fact hylocichla ustulata ustulata nuttall russet backed thrush there were a very few individuals of this species still lingering in the region when we arrived at the mouth of the stikine river about the middle of august one was seen on sergief island august 18 and another on september 4 both in the alder thickets that surrounded our camp as neither one was taken it is of course possible that the birds seen were of the subspecies swainsoni rather than ustulata our experience on the stikine disclosed the presence of swainsoni so far down the river that it would not be surprising if occasional individuals should wander quite to the coast during migration however as sergief island is within the known range of ustulata while swainsoni has never yet been taken on the coast it is proper to refer the records from that point to the race known to occur there hylocichla ustulata swainsoni tschudi olive backed thrush one of the commoner species of the upper stikine valley first noted at the junction on may 28 the next three days saw an influx of considerable numbers on may 31 the first song was heard so similar to the to us more familiar notes of the russet backed thrush as to be indistinguishable on june 5 a female was shot with eggs beginning to enlarge in the ovary on june 9 one was taken which had laid part of its set and on june 12 the first set of eggs was obtained a young bird just out of the nest was taken at glenora on july 7 and full grown juvenals were collected at flood glacier early in august this is a bird of the poplar woods and willow thickets of the lowlands primarily but we found it also in small numbers well up the mountain sides on july 17 dixon saw several at the upper edge of the spruce timber about 4000 feet on the mountains above doch da on creek nests found were all at the lower levels the first discovered was in fairly open woods mostly of small willows and in a very exposed iii v ill302 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 ij li 1 situation the nest was about four feet from the ground between four upright willow branches and there was no concealing green growth about it the material used was mostly dried weed stems grass and shreds of bark the lining differs from the outer structure only in that it consists of finer material of the same sort dimensions of this nest are as follows greatest outside diameter 170 mm inside diameter 68 outside depth 100 inside depth 40 it contained four eggs partly incubated a second nest was collected on june 19 essentially like the first except that it is less bulky this was in an alder about four feet from the ground alongside a seldom used road and again in a most exposed situation the set was of four eggs on june 19 still another nest was found in a crotch in a dead willow about eight feet up in this one there are more and coarser bark strips used and a good deal of the cottony fiber from the fireweed pods it contained five eggs the last occupied nest was found at doch da on creek july 21 containing three eggs nearly ready to hatch this was in an alder about three feet from the ground in the case of the nest last described the parent bird presumably the female was in great distress and did not go very far away with each of the others the sitting bird slipped unobtrusively away and did not return until some time had elapsed probably never under twenty minutes at great glacier august 11 a young bird was collected not yet able to fly that is clearly referable to swainsoni this last record is of considerable interest as it carries the breeding range of swainsoni westward in this region to a point about thirty miles from the coast the habitat of hylocichla u ustulata although the habitats of the two subspecies thus approach so closely there is no evidence of intergradation of characters between them in the stikine river series of swainsoni there is not one specimen of an equivocal character on the contrary these birds like those from the yukon region show an extreme of grayness compared with typical swainsoni from eastern north america that carries them farther from ustulata in appearance than are specimens from the atlantic coast in this connection see oberholser 1898 p 305 it may be pointed out also that although ustulata and suminsoni breed in different parts of northern california there is no section of that state that is known to be occupied by birds of intermediate character as in the stikine region both occur in typical form quite to the margins of their respective habitats thus if ustulata and swainsoni are to be regarded as two subspecies of one1922 swarth birds and mammals of the stikine region 303 species it must be on the criterion of individual variation rather than on that of gradual blending through the population of contiguous territories in the stikine region the two forms occur in the interior and on the coast respectively and within a few miles of each other as distinct in

were a few pairs nesting along telegraph creek to within a mile or two of the stikine but mostly the birds were at higher elevations none was seen in the immediate vicinity of glenora or of doch da on creek but the species was encountered in spruce woods on the mountains above the latter point at about 3000 feet altitude two nests were taken the first no 1827 was found on may 23 with three eggs and collected on may 26 with a set of five it was in the creek bottom about two miles north of the town of telegraph creek some three feet from the ground in a spruce sapling the nest rested against the trunk and upon some small branches the outer structure is of twigs weed stems rootlets and bark strips the lining is of fine rootlets and grass with a good many of the long overhairs of a porcupine it measures as follows greatest outside diameter about 160 mm outside depth 90 inside diameter 60 inside depth 40 mm the second nest no 1828 was taken june 4 with four slightly incubated eggs this was found near the junction four miles north of telegraph creek amid similar surroundings to the first one it was placed between two small spruce trees thirty inches from the ground in general appearance and in details of structure it is very similar to the first one found even to the porcupine hairs in the lining both were in situations where there was little concealing vegetation and were easily seen from some distance five specimens two males and three females were collected between telegraph creek and the summit nos 40309 40313 the hermit thrush of this general region has been referred to

some were seen clear to the summit on may 30 one bird was seen carrying building material but this must have been rather late for young were out of the nest on june 9 robins were fairly numerous at glenora and at doch da on creek by the time we reached the latter place the middle of july the spotted young comprised a large proportion of the birds seen 306 university of california publications in zoology you 24 at flood glacier our next stopping place down stream robins abruptly became very scarce call notes were heard on july 29 but the birds were not seen at great glacier too there were very few around two seen but not obtained on august 11 were the only ones noted nine specimens nos 40318 40326 were collected on the upper stikine river at telegraph creek glenora and doch da on creek the series comprises two adult males five adult females and two juvenals these birds are referable to the eastern subspecies planesticus migratorius migratorius the outer rectrices are conspicuously tipped with white which is not the case with the coast form p m caurinus a differentiating character that is readily apparent even in the live birds the young from telegraph creek are of a differ entflsolor from the coast birds being less brownish and more gray especially on the upper parts just how far down the river p m migratorius extends we did not definitely ascertain but as noted above robins wfere abundant as far down the river as doch da on creek and abruptly became very scarce just below there a little below doch da on creek and from that point down forest conditions are such that it seems doubtful that there are many robins breeding anywhere along the lower river while we saw and heard a few at flood glacier and great glacier we obtained no specimens so cannot be certain which subspecies occurs at those points planesticus migratorius caurinus grinnell northwestern robin fairly numerous at sergief island though irregularly so during the whole of our stay at that place

thrush seen on sergief island at various times during our stay there august 17 to september 7 the subspecies is of course a summer visitant and reasonably abundant throughout the coast region of southeastern alaska one specimen was collected no 40332 a young male just beginning to molt into first winter plumage ixoreus naevius meruloides swainson northern varied thrush there were no varied thrushes in the immediate vicinity of telegraph creek nowhere in the river valley at least we were constantly on the lookout for them and both the birds and the call notes are sufficiently conspicuous to be readily detected by any one familiar with the species subsequent experience farther down the river leads me to believe that they probably breed at higher altitudes throughout the region we ourselves found them at but one such station at glenora early in the morning of july 1 the call note of a varied thrush was heard distinctly several times repeated the bird was in thick shrubbery at the river s edge and could not be seen it was assumed to be a wandering individual finished with family cares and straying from the breeding ground on the nearby mountains on july 11 a male varied thrush was seen on the mountain side above doch da on creek at about 3000 feet altitude the bird was perched high on a dead spruce stub a hundred feet or more above the ground uttering at frequent intervals the disconnected notes comprising the song of this species later on others were seen or heard at about the same elevation on july 18 a young bird was seen at the level of the stikine river at doch da on creek and from then on a few others were observed from time to time there were a few in the woods at flood glacier and at great glacier exceedingly wary and most difficult to see three specimens were collected at flood glacier nos 40328 40330 an adult male and two juvenal females and one at great glacier an adult female no 40331 these birds are all referable to the interior subspecies ixoreus n meruloides 308 university of california publications in zoology vol 24 sialia currucoides bechstein mountain bluebird there were two or three pairs in the town of telegraph creek presumably nesting about some of the buildings a few others were seen within a radius of ten or twelve miles usually around small clearings where there had been some attempt at cultivation of the ground or in burnt over areas where fire had swept away most of the large timber two nests were found on june 14 a set of four eggs no 1829 about half incubated was taken the nest was in an old woodpecker hole in a dead birch stub eight feet from the ground this was near the shore of sawmill lake on a slope that had been lumbered and burnt over so that it was nearly cleared of large trees a second nest was found in another birch stub nearby a trunk that was occupied by a pair of tree swallows as well as the bluebirds this nest on june 17 contained four newly hatched young and one egg about ready to hatch curiously no bluebirds were seen near glenora though the open fields and old houses were features that should have attracted them and the species undoubtedly does occur thereabout at times on july 23 a small flock was seen at timber line about 4000 feet altitude above doch da on creek apparently the beginning of the migratory movement at the close of the nesting season i have
